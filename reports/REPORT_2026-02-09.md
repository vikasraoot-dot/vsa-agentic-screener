## 🚀 Ready for Entry
### ADBE (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Confirmed Weakness)

The Quarterly trend is BEARISH. The stock is exhibiting classic Supply Dominance. Weekly 2026-01-12 showed a wide spread down on high volume (RelVol 1.41, CLV -0.96), confirming supply entry. The latest week (2026-02-02) confirmed severe weakness with a very wide spread down on extremely high volume (RelVol 1.83) and a close near the low (CLV -0.75).

**Key Levels:** Major Resistance: 306.30, Immediate Resistance: 299.38, Support: 264.04 (Last Weekly Low)

### ADSK (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Confirmed Weakness)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH. The stock has been under sustained pressure. The latest weekly candle (2026-02-02) is a very wide spread down on very high volume (RelVol 2.03) closing near the mid-point (CLV -0.50), indicating a massive supply surge. Although the CLV isn't fully bearish, the sheer volume and spread size confirm significant pressure and a clear markdown phase continuation, especially given the Quarterly BEARISH context.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Resistance: 259.66, Support: 234.00 (Last Weekly Low), Major Supply Zone: 270.00 - 274.25

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below 234.00 on confirmation volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 260.00

### AEVA (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Confirmed Weakness)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH. After an initial spike (2026-01-05, RelVol 3.54), the stock has failed dramatically. The last two weeks showed severe weakness: 2026-01-19 (wide spread down, CLV -0.98), and 2026-01-26 (wide spread down, CLV -0.83). The latest week (2026-02-02) is a reaction up close on low spread/volume, barely closing above the mid-point (CLV 0.02), which shows limited buying interest following the significant drop. The monthly CLV of 0.02 suggests demand is trying to hold $12, but the overall structure is poor.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Resistance: 13.56, Support: 11.18 (Last Weekly Low), Supply Peak: 22.62

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below 11.18 (Support confirmed by monthly/weekly structure).

The latest weekly bar (2026-02-02) is a wide spread down on very high volume (RelVol 2.30) closing near the low (CLV -0.53). This confirms institutional supply continuing the markdown. The price action is breaking major support levels with significant effort.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Resistance: 21.43, Support: 16.23 (Last Weekly Low), Supply Zone: 23.50 - 24.46

#### Action Plan

The stock broke down severely on the latest weekly bar (2026-02-02) with an extremely wide spread down on massive, record volume (RelVol 2.57), closing far from the low (CLV -0.56). This massive selling event confirms institutional distribution. The selling pressure is overwhelming, suggesting a significant markdown phase is beginning.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Resistance: 246.35, Support: 200.31 (Last Weekly Low), Distribution Peak: 248.94

#### Action Plan

---
### AMZU (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Confirmed Weakness)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BEARISH. Similar to AMZN, the latest weekly bar (2026-02-02) is a wide spread down on extremely high volume (RelVol 3.13), closing near the mid-point (CLV -0.58). This confirms massive supply and institutional distribution, suggesting the markdown phase is active. The sheer volume on this bar is highly bearish.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Resistance: 39.15, Support: 25.48 (Last Weekly Low), Distribution Peak: 40.40

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below 25.48.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 38.00
---
### APH (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Failed Attempt)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the recent weekly action is concerning. Weekly 2026-01-26 showed a huge spread down on very high volume (RelVol 2.28), closing near the low (CLV -0.69). The latest bar (2026-02-02) is another very wide spread down on high volume (RelVol 1.92), also closing near the low (CLV -0.12). Despite the 'Stopping Volume' signal, the successive wide spread down bars on high volume confirms relentless institutional selling (distribution). The rally attempt failed violently.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Resistance: 149.24, Support: 126.21 (Last Weekly Low), Supply Zone: 147.90 - 167.04

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below 126.21 on confirmation volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 150.00

### APP (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Confirmed Weakness)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH. The stock is in a severe markdown. Weekly 2026-01-12 was a wide spread down on high volume (CLV -0.85). The last two weeks saw continued, aggressive selling confirmed by wide spread down bars, high volume, and low closing prices (2026-01-26 CLV -0.81; 2026-02-02 CLV -0.37). The latest bar had very high volume (RelVol 2.00) and an extremely wide spread, confirming institutional selling is overwhelming any attempts at demand.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Resistance: 509.00, Support: 360.12 (Last Weekly Low), Major Supply Zone: 540.96 - 578.76

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below 360.12.

### APPN (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Confirmed Weakness)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH. The stock is exhibiting classic Supply Dominance. The latest weekly bar (2026-02-02) is a wide spread down on high volume (RelVol 1.90), closing mid-range (CLV -0.39). This confirms the markdown phase is continuing. The prior weak rally attempt (2026-01-19, CLV 0.61) failed quickly, cementing the bearish control.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Resistance: 28.30, Support: 23.88 (Last Weekly Low), Supply Zone: 27.59 - 31.20

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below 23.88.

---
### ARCC (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Confirmed Weakness)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BEARISH. Although Weekly VSA suggests Stopping Volume (Watch for Test), the latest weekly bar (2026-02-02) is a wide spread down on extremely high volume (RelVol 2.23), closing near the mid-point (CLV -0.026). The volume suggests significant selling pressure and weakness, negating the bullish potential of the stopping volume signal, as professional sellers are dumping heavily into the attempted accumulation zone.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Resistance: 19.89, Support: 18.76 (Last Weekly Low), Supply Zone: 20.39 - 21.14

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below 18.76 on confirmation volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 20.00
---
### ARES (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Confirmed Weakness)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BEARISH. The latest weekly bar (2026-02-02) is a very wide spread down on massive volume (RelVol 3.04), closing near the mid-point (CLV -0.29). This is an exceptionally high volume sell-off, confirming intense institutional distribution and a continuation of the markdown phase. The stock broke key recent support levels with great effort.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Resistance: 150.63, Support: 119.40 (Last Weekly Low), Distribution Peak: 177.72

#### Action Plan

- **Invalidation:** Close above 69.50
---
### AVAV (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Monthly Buying Climax (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the stock has experienced massive volatility suggesting a climax phase. Weekly 2026-01-19 and 2026-01-26 showed huge spread down bars on high volume, confirming supply/distribution. The latest weekly bar (2026-02-02) is another wide spread down on high volume (RelVol 1.49), closing weakly mid-range (CLV -0.13). The extreme volatility and persistent high volume selling from the highs (408.25) suggests the end of the markup phase and institutional distribution is active, overriding the Quarterly trend.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 321.04, Support: 234.00 (Last Weekly Low), Climax Peak: 408.25

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below 234.00.

### AXON (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Confirmed Weakness)

Quarterly trend is BEARISH. The stock is in a confirmed markdown phase, exhibiting extreme weakness. Weekly 2026-01-26 was a huge spread down on high volume (RelVol 1.31), closing at the absolute low (CLV -0.96). The latest bar (2026-02-02) is another wide spread down on very high volume (RelVol 2.29), confirming intense institutional selling and breaking significant support. This is high conviction bearish structure.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Resistance: 491.26, Support: 396.41 (Last Weekly Low), Major Supply Zone: 595.54 - 640.72

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below 396.41.

---
### AXTA (NEUTRAL/BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Confirmed Early)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BULLISH, supported by the Monthly Stopping Volume confirmation. The price consolidated in January. The latest weekly bar (2026-02-02) is a wide spread up on high volume (RelVol 1.13), closing strongly near the high (CLV 0.52). This indicates demand is pushing the price higher after absorbing selling pressure around the $33 level. This is a bullish sign within the accumulation pattern.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Resistance: 34.55 (Last Weekly High), Support: 31.45 (Last Weekly Low), Accumulation Range: 31.45 - 34.55

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close above 34.55 on confirming volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 32.70
---
### AXTI (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BULLISH. The stock had a massive volume spike in early January (RelVol 3.82), suggesting a Buying Climax. However, the subsequent drop (Supply Dominance detected) was followed by a powerful reversal. The latest weekly bar (2026-02-02) is an extremely wide spread up on high volume (RelVol 1.90), closing at the absolute high (CLV 0.97). This strong demand signal is overwhelming prior supply and suggests a re-ignition of the markup phase, potentially resolving the prior climax bullishly.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 26.66 (Climax High), Support: 16.50 (Last Weekly Low), Immediate Demand: 24.15

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Continuation move above 24.15 or a low volume pullback to 20.38.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 19.50
---
### BAH (NEUTRAL/BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Monthly Buying Climax (Confirmed Early)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BULLISH. The Monthly Buying Climax suggested prior distribution, but the latest weekly bar (2026-02-02) showed a strong recovery: wide spread up on high volume (RelVol 1.09), closing near the high (CLV 0.89). This confirms renewed demand absorbing the selling pressure observed during the late January dip (2026-01-26, CLV -0.84). This suggests the dip was a shakeout rather than the start of a deep markdown.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Resistance: 89.46, Support: 81.15 (Shakeout Low), Climax High: 109.10

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close above 89.46, confirming continuation of the rally.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 87.00
---
### BANC (NEUTRAL/BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Monthly Buying Climax (Confirmed Strong)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BULLISH. Monthly VSA signaled a Buying Climax, suggesting distribution, but the subsequent weekly action contradicts a full breakdown. Weekly 2026-02-02 is a wide spread up bar on massive volume (RelVol 2.20), closing strongly near the high (CLV 0.88). This strong demand confirms that recent selling (2026-01-19, CLV -0.96) was likely a shakeout and accumulation continues within the bullish context.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 21.61 (Climax High), Support: 19.41, Immediate Demand: 20.85

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close above 21.00 on strong volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 20.40
---
### BBIO (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Confirmed Weakness)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BEARISH. After sideways consolidation, the latest weekly bar (2026-02-02) is a very wide spread down on extremely high volume (RelVol 1.99), closing near the low (CLV -0.39). While the close isn't the absolute bottom, the surge in volume and spread size confirms aggressive selling and markdown continuation. The consolidation range broke down convincingly.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Resistance: 80.00, Support: 62.84 (Last Weekly Low), Consolidation Range: 75.83 - 80.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below 62.84.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 77.00
---
### BBT (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Monthly Buying Climax (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BULLISH. Despite the Monthly Buying Climax alert, the latest weekly bar (2026-02-02) is a very wide spread up on high volume (RelVol 1.51), closing near the high (CLV 0.87). This powerful demand signal confirms buyers are stepping in aggressively, likely resulting in a successful test of prior supply. This is a strong bullish signal.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 31.80 (Last Weekly High), Support: 28.18, Immediate Demand: 31.57

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close above 31.80, confirming new markup phase.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 29.50
---
### BBVA (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Confirmed Weakness)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the recent weekly action suggests a shift. The latest weekly bar (2026-02-02) is a very wide spread down on massive volume (RelVol 2.85), closing near the mid-point (CLV -0.38). This high volume selling, breaking recent support, suggests significant institutional distribution is overwhelming the long-term bullish trend and initiating a markdown phase.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Resistance: 26.20, Support: 23.15 (Last Weekly Low), Supply Zone: 24.89 - 26.14

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below 23.15 on confirmation volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 25.00
---
### BBWI (NEUTRAL/BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Monthly Supply Dominance (Confirmed Early)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the Monthly chart suggests Supply Dominance. However, the last two weeks showed demand re-entering strongly. Weekly 2026-01-26 showed an up close (CLV 0.61). The latest weekly bar (2026-02-02) is a wide spread up on high volume (RelVol 0.74), closing strongly near the high (CLV 0.64). This demand signal suggests accumulation is winning, potentially leading to a breakout from the recent tight range.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Resistance: 23.73, Support: 21.54 (Last Weekly Low), Accumulation Base: 20.52 - 21.81

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close above 23.73, confirming markup continuation.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 21.50
---
### BCE (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Confirmed Weakness)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the stock is showing clear signs of distribution. The price rallied strongly throughout January. The latest weekly bar (2026-02-02) is a wide spread down on massive volume (RelVol 2.22), closing near the low (CLV -0.85). This high-volume reversal, breaking the recent trend, is a strong signal of institutional supply overwhelming demand, initiating a markdown phase, regardless of the quarterly trend.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Resistance: 26.49 (Last Weekly High), Support: 24.97 (Last Weekly Low), Distribution Peak: 25.89

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below 24.97 on confirmation volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 26.00
---
### BEP (NEUTRAL/BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Monthly Supply Dominance (Confirmed Early)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BULLISH. Despite the Monthly Supply Dominance warning, the latest weekly bar (2026-02-02) is a narrow spread up on high volume (RelVol 0.88), closing strongly near the high (CLV 0.64). This indicates persistent demand overcoming prior selling (2026-01-05, CLV -0.78). The narrow spread on the recent up move suggests efficiency in movement, confirming the continuing accumulation within the bullish trend.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Resistance: 30.72 (Last Weekly High), Support: 29.33, Accumulation Range: 26.71 - 30.72

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close above 30.72.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 29.80
---
### BFH (NEUTRAL/BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BULLISH. The initial markdown (Weekly 2026-01-19, CLV -0.91) was sharply reversed by Stopping Volume in the latest bar (2026-02-02). This bar is a wide spread up on high volume (RelVol 1.50), closing strongly near the high (CLV 0.90). This indicates aggressive institutional buying, successfully absorbing supply and likely initiating the Automatic Rally phase within the accumulation area defined by the drop in mid-January.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Resistance: 79.93 (Last Weekly High), Support/Stopping Zone: 71.80 (Last Weekly Low), Supply Zone: 82.03

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 79.93, confirming markup continuation.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 74.00
---
### BHP (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly chart showed extremely high volume (30.45M, 28.25M) on the last two weeks, forming a clear Buying Climax (CLV -0.67, -0.61). The last weekly bar was Wide Spread Down (WSD) on high volume, confirming that Smart Money (SM) is distributing heavily. The monthly chart for February shows lower spread and lower CLV on high relative volume, indicating continued distribution/stopping action after January's wide spread up and high volume. The initial bullish trend is now exhausted and potentially reversing.

**Key Levels:** Support (Low V): 68.69, Resistance (Climax High): 74.98

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below the most recent low (68.69) or weak rally failure below 70.00.
- **Invalidation:** Above 74.98 (Climax High)
---
### BNS (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance Exhaustion

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Trend is BULLISH. Although the prior weekly bars showed Supply Dominance signals (WSD, CLV -0.58), the last bar (2026-02-02) is a WSU bar closing near the high (CLV 0.88) on high volume (RelVol 1.28). This VSA signature represents renewed strength and demand overcoming previous minor supply. The prior two weeks of downward effort (CLV -0.58) resulted in a minimal price drop, indicating absorption.

**Key Levels:** Support: 73.72 (Recent Low), Target/Resistance: 76.55

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 76.55 on strong volume, or a pullback to 74.50 area.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 73.72
---
### BP (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance Failed / Strength

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence previously signaled Supply Dominance, but the last two bars (2026-01-26 and 2026-02-02) showed increasing volume and upward closes (CLV 0.16, 0.54) despite the overall trend being flagged for supply. The most recent bar is a wide spread up bar closing high (CLV 0.54) on high volume (RelVol 1.51). This confirms Professional Demand is dominating, effectively negating the earlier supply warnings. The quarterly trend is BULLISH.

**Key Levels:** Support: 37.29, Target/Resistance: 39.51

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Pullback to 38.00 area or break above 39.51.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 37.29
---
### BROS (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax / Strength

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stock saw heavy selling pressure (Supply Dominance) culminating in a WSD bar (2026-01-26) on exceptionally high volume (RelVol 2.48), followed by a massive WSU bar (2026-02-02) closing near the high (CLV 0.96) on high volume (RelVol 1.67). This is a textbook response to a Selling Climax, indicating strong professional buying and reversal action. The last bar effectively clears out the supply area, suggesting a strong turn.

**Key Levels:** Support: 51.76 (Climax Low), Target/Resistance: 62.88

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry on a slight pullback, targeting accumulation area 54.00-56.00.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 51.76
---
### BSX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax / Severe Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Trend is BEARISH. The last weekly bar (2026-02-02) is a massive wide spread down bar (Spread 19.31) on record volume (RelVol 3.84), confirming a Supply Dominance event that turned into a Selling Climax. Although the close is slightly off the low (CLV -0.85), the sheer size and volume suggest extreme pressure. This move likely breaks key support, confirming continuation of the bear trend.

**Key Levels:** New Resistance: 93.53 (Previous Support), Low/Support: 74.86

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 74.86, or a short-covering rally failing below 80.00.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 93.53
---
### BX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax / Extreme Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stock experienced heavy Supply Dominance, culminating in the last weekly bar (2026-02-02), which is an extremely wide spread down bar on enormous volume (RelVol 2.92). The close is slightly off the low (CLV -0.50), suggesting Stopping Volume, but the magnitude of the drop and volume indicates extreme distribution and panic selling. Given the bearish quarterly context, this is a clear sign of trend continuation/acceleration down.

**Key Levels:** New Resistance: 143.26, Low/Support: 125.27

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 125.27, or weak rally failing below 135.00.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 143.26

### BYD (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Weak Rally

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stock remains in a BEARISH Quarterly Trend. The last weekly bar (2026-02-02) is a WSD bar on very high volume (RelVol 1.92), closing off the low (CLV -0.28). While the volume is high, the market closed significantly down, indicating that despite some buying interest, supply remains dominant. The high volume move didn't manage to sustain a strong rally.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 86.77 (High of Rally), Support: 81.28 (Low of Bar)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 81.28 on confirming volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 86.77
---
### CALM (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Reversal Bar

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar (2026-02-02) is a very wide spread down bar on high volume (RelVol 1.22), closing near the low (CLV -0.93). This is a strong Supply Dominance signal, despite the quarterly bullish context. It suggests Smart Money is distributing heavily at these high levels, confirmed by the wide spread and poor close. This move negates the strong rally seen in the two weeks prior.

**Key Levels:** New Resistance: 89.48 (Supply High), Support: 82.28

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 82.28 on volume, targeting the next support area.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 89.48

### CALX (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax Reversal

**Smart Money Logic:**
The price saw heavy Supply Dominance (WSD, extreme volume, CLV -0.93 on 2026-01-26). The following week (2026-02-02) provided a bullish reversal signal: a wide spread up bar closing near the high (CLV 0.82) on high volume (RelVol 2.74). This confirms aggressive institutional accumulation at the prior week's low (44.25), marking a strong reversal, despite the overall weekly sequence being flagged for supply.

**Key Levels:** Support: 44.70 (Low of Reversal), Target/Resistance: 57.32

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry on a pullback toward 50.00, or break above 53.98.

---
### CBRL (BULLISH)

Despite the monthly chart signaling Supply Dominance, the last weekly bar (2026-02-02) is a wide spread up bar closing near the high (CLV 0.73) on average volume (RelVol 0.99). This robust move shows renewed buying interest and absorption of recent supply (seen in the WSD bar on 2026-01-19, CLV -0.87). This strength suggests the market is ready to resume the Quarterly BULLISH TREND.

**Key Levels:** Support: 29.70, Target/Resistance: 34.43

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 34.43 or pullback to 32.00 area.

Despite the monthly Supply Dominance alert, the last weekly bar (2026-02-02) is a strong Wide Spread Up bar, closing near its high (CLV 0.90) on high volume (RelVol 1.39). This decisive movement indicates strong demand and negates the prior Supply Dominance. Smart Money is clearly active on the buy side, confirming the continuation of the Quarterly BULLISH TREND.

**Key Levels:** Support: 52.35, Target/Resistance: 55.31

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 55.31 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 52.35
---
### CMPO (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume Reversal

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence showed downward pressure, but the last bar (2026-02-02) is a strong wide spread up bar closing high (CLV 0.56) on very high volume (RelVol 1.94). This dramatic rebound, following weakness on 01-26 (CLV -0.43), suggests aggressive institutional buying, effectively reversing the short-term bearishness. This confirms accumulation and strength, likely leading to trend continuation in the BULLISH Quarterly Context.

**Key Levels:** Support: 21.60, Target/Resistance: 25.25

#### Action Plan

Despite the Stopping Volume alert, the stock displays continuous strength. The last weekly bar (2026-02-02) is a WSU bar closing at the high (CLV 0.98) on high volume (RelVol 1.48). This is a strong bullish signal, confirming professional demand and continuation of the BULLISH Quarterly Trend. The high close and volume suggest sustained upward momentum.

**Key Levels:** Support: 35.80, Target/Resistance: 39.12 (New High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry on pullback to 37.00-38.00 or break above 39.12.

---
### CNXC (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume Reversal

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence showed a period of supply dominance and down-close on 01-26 (CLV -0.63). The most recent bar (2026-02-02) is a strong WSU bar closing near the high (CLV 0.94) on high volume (RelVol 1.56). This reversal on strength and volume suggests effective accumulation (Stopping Volume) near 36.31, leading to a clean sign of strength. The monthly CLV also shows strong recovery.

**Key Levels:** Support: 36.31, Target/Resistance: 40.03

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 40.03 or pullback to 38.00 area.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 36.31
---

Despite the monthly Buying Climax warning, the weekly chart shows clear signs of strength. The last bar (2026-02-02) is a WSU bar closing high (CLV 0.64) on higher volume (RelVol 1.16). This movement suggests the price is accumulating strength above key support levels, confirming professional demand and rejecting bearish moves seen in early January.

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 31.50 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 29.61
---
### CSGP (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax / Extreme Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stock is in a strong BEARISH Quarterly Trend, reinforced by monthly Supply Dominance. The last weekly bar (2026-02-02) is an extremely wide spread down bar on massive volume (RelVol 2.16). The close is near the low (CLV -0.78), indicating overwhelming supply. This is a dramatic Supply Dominance event, suggesting acceleration of the bearish move and breaking key support levels.

**Key Levels:** New Resistance: 61.50, Support/Low: 48.76

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 48.76 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 61.50
---
### CTRA (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Strength Confirmed / Buying Climax Retest

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence previously signaled a Buying Climax. However, the last bar (2026-02-02) is a strong WSU bar closing near the high (CLV 0.84) on massive volume (RelVol 2.55). This volume surge, combined with a strong close, suggests overwhelming demand, successfully testing and rejecting the earlier supply concerns. This indicates bullish trend continuation, consistent with the Quarterly BULLISH TREND.

**Key Levels:** Support: 27.43, Target/Resistance: 30.94 (New High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Pullback to 29.00 area or break above 30.94.

### CVS (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume Reversal

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stock experienced heavy Supply Dominance culminating in a WSD bar (2026-01-26) on extreme volume (RelVol 2.33). The last weekly bar (2026-02-02) is a strong WSU bar closing high (CLV 0.78) on high volume (RelVol 1.34). This decisive upward reversal, following a massive volume spike near the low (70.69), confirms strong institutional accumulation (Stopping Volume Reversal).

**Key Levels:** Support: 73.40, Target/Resistance: 78.96

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry on a pullback to 76.00 area or break above 78.96.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 73.40
---
### ENR (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax Failed / Strength

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence showed conflicting signals, with a Buying Climax warning followed by downward pressure. However, the last two bars (01-26, 02-02) are strong Wide Spread Up bars closing high, indicating renewed strength. The latest bar (2026-02-02) closes high (CLV 0.23) on very high volume (RelVol 1.95). This confirms demand is strong and overcoming prior supply/climax efforts. The quarterly trend is BULLISH.

**Key Levels:** Support: 21.56, Target/Resistance: 24.54 (New High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Pullback to 22.50 area or break above 24.54.

---
### EPAM (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax / Extreme Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stock remains in a BEARISH Quarterly Trend. The last weekly bar (2026-02-02) is an extremely wide spread down bar on massive volume (RelVol 1.89), closing mid-range (CLV -0.35). While the close off the low (173.44) suggests some Stopping Volume, the huge range and high volume indicate overwhelming distribution and supply pressure, likely accelerating the downtrend.

**Key Levels:** New Resistance: 208.60, Low/Support: 173.45

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 173.45, or weak rally failure below 190.00.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 208.60
---
### FER (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result (Supply Confirmation)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar shows a wide spread UP on below average relative volume (RelVol 0.80). However, the price closed near the high (CLV 0.91). This suggests strong buying interest (Effort) that resulted in a close near the high (Result). Crucially, the monthly sequence is confirmed early SUPPLY_DOMINANCE, but this weekly bar is attacking resistance levels with intent. The context is bullish trend quarterly, suggesting this push is continuation despite previous monthly weakness. The wide spread close near high suggests supply absorption was successful, indicating Smart Money is still accumulating/pushing price.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 71.39 (High of last bar), Support: 67.01 (Previous low before breakout)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry above 71.40 on sustained volume, confirming strength over the last high.
- **Invalidation:** A close below 67.50, which would negate the recent strength and suggest the previous monthly supply dominance is still active.
---
### FFIN (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result (Absorption/Test of Supply)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is a very wide spread UP bar on high volume (RelVol 1.55), closing near the high (CLV 0.86). This is a strong sign of demand, overcoming the prior week's Supply Dominance signal (high volume, low close). The prior week (01/26) showed high volume (RelVol 1.80) closing near the low (CLV -0.50), indicating supply entered, but the subsequent week absorbed and reversed that pressure strongly. This looks like Stopping Volume followed by a strong up-thrust/absorption.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 35.00 (Last high), Support: 31.69 (Low of last bar)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry above 35.00, confirming the break of the recent high and continuation of the bullish quarter trend.
- **Invalidation:** A close below 31.69, which would negate the strong buying action of the last week.
---
### FHB (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Test/No Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is a medium spread UP bar on high volume (RelVol 1.66), closing near the high (CLV 0.71). This follows a week of heavy volume and a close near the low (01/26, Supply Dominance detection). The last bar suggests successful absorption of that supply, showing strong demand pushing the price up and holding the close. This looks like a successful shakeout and immediate recovery, common in accumulation phases within a bullish trend.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 27.43 (Last high), Support: 26.10 (Previous supply low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry above 27.43, confirming a continued breakout and strength.
- **Invalidation:** A close below 26.00, suggesting the shakeout was a failure.
---
### FIGR (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Climax Action/Supply Dominance Continuation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The ticker is in a strong bearish quarterly trend. The last weekly bar is a very wide spread DOWN bar on ultra-high volume (RelVol 1.97), closing near the low (CLV -0.77). This is a definitive sign of continued Supply Dominance and potential panic selling (Selling Climax potential but in a downtrend, it acts as a continuation signal unless immediately reversed). The massive volume spike confirms Smart Money selling pressure or liquidation is active.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 55.00 (Last open), Support: 39.29 (Last low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on a break of 39.29, or on a weak rally (No Demand/Test of Supply).
- **Invalidation:** A quick recovery and close above 55.00.
---
### FOXA (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is a very wide spread DOWN bar on ultra-high volume (RelVol 1.87), closing near the absolute low (CLV -0.84). This is overwhelming evidence of aggressive supply and bearish momentum continuation in a bearish quarterly trend. The volume spike confirms Smart Money distribution/liquidation.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 72.92 (Prior high), Support: 64.11 (Last low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry below 64.11, confirming the break of the recent major support.
- **Invalidation:** A recovery and close above 72.00, negating the large down bar.
---
### GE (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result (Strength Confirmation)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is a wide spread UP bar on high volume (RelVol 1.50), closing near the high (CLV 0.80). This strongly confirms demand and continuation of the bullish quarterly trend, overcoming the previous supply scare (01/19 Supply Dominance/Shakeout). The wide spread close near the high indicates efficient upward movement with strong institutional backing. The weekly Supply Dominance detection is marked WATCH_FOR_TEST, but the last bar suggests the test failed (i.e., supply absorbed).

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 323.18 (Last high), Support: 301.02 (Last low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry above 323.18 on confirming volume.
- **Invalidation:** A close below 301.00.
---
### GKOS (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result (Potential Supply)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is a wide spread DOWN bar on below average volume (RelVol 0.93), closing near the low (CLV -0.66). This is a weak sign, especially following two previous weeks of wide-spread/high-volume bearish closes (01/19 and 01/26), suggesting a continuous leakage of supply. The monthly context is BUYING_CLIMAX (WATCH_FOR_TEST), implying previous strength is failing. The failure to rally on high volume confirms the bearish outlook in a bearish quarterly trend.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 121.74 (Last high), Support: 110.65 (Last low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry below 110.65, confirming breakdown from the consolidation zone.
- **Invalidation:** A close above 121.74.
---
### GNTX (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result (Demand Confirmation)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is a wide spread UP bar on high volume (RelVol 1.70), closing mid-to-high (CLV 0.13). The strong volume accompanied by the price rally confirms active demand, successfully reversing the momentum from the previous week's supply signal (01/26 wide spread down, CLV -0.24). This suggests supply absorption and demand returning, supporting the bullish quarterly trend, despite the confirmed early monthly Supply Dominance signal.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 25.14 (Last high), Support: 22.78 (Last low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry above 25.14 on confirming volume, establishing new strength.
- **Invalidation:** A close below 22.78.
---
### HDB (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply/Demand Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is a wide spread UP bar on ultra-high volume (RelVol 2.20), closing at the absolute high (CLV 1.0). This is textbook demand confirmation, overpowering any lingering supply from the bearish quarterly trend and previous Supply Dominance signals. The strong close suggests Smart Money is aggressively buying, indicating a potential major reversal of the bearish trend, matching the strong CLV of the monthly bar (CLV 1.0).

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 34.46 (Last high/Close), Support: 32.08 (Last low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry above 34.46 on continuation, targeting higher resistance levels.
- **Invalidation:** A close below 32.08.
---
### HPE (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Demand Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is a wide spread UP bar on high volume (RelVol 0.88), closing near the high (CLV 0.84). This bar confirms strong demand and absorption, following a series of tight-spread, low-volume bars (01/12, 01/19, 01/26) that lacked supply follow-through. The strong close near the high indicates efficient institutional buying. This aligns with the Monthly sequence confirmed as STRONG STOPPING VOLUME, suggesting a successful bottoming process and reversal.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 23.80 (Last high), Support: 21.35 (Last low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry above 23.80, confirming breakout and trend reversal.
- **Invalidation:** A close below 21.35.
---
### IMAX (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result (Strength Confirmation)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is a wide spread UP bar on high volume (RelVol 0.96), closing near the high (CLV 0.84). This is strong demand confirmation, following a period of correction. The previous monthly sequence was confirmed early Stopping Volume, suggesting Smart Money bought the low, and this bar confirms the mark-up phase is starting, aligning with the bullish quarterly trend.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 37.50 (Last high), Support: 34.60 (Last low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry above 37.50 on confirming volume.
- **Invalidation:** A close below 34.60.
---
### IONQ (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result / Supply Continuation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is a very wide spread DOWN bar on ultra-high volume (RelVol 1.38), closing mid-range (CLV -0.06). While the spread is massive and the volume is high, the close is mid-range, suggesting some absorption/climax action near the low. However, given the bearish quarterly trend and the failure of the market to sustain prices, this likely represents powerful supply continuation, potentially institutional exit. The monthly sequence is BUYING_CLIMAX (WATCH_FOR_TEST), which often precedes strong reversals downward.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 40.72 (Last high), Support: 29.99 (Last low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry below 29.99, confirming breakdown. Watch for immediate No Demand on any small rally.
- **Invalidation:** A close above 40.72.
---
### ITT (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Demand Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is a very wide spread UP bar on extremely high volume (RelVol 2.29), closing near the high (CLV 0.92). This is overwhelming demand, confirming continuation of the bullish quarterly trend and overcoming the previous monthly Supply Dominance warning. The efficient move up on high volume signifies major institutional buying and a probable breakout to new highs.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 207.86 (Last high), Support: 181.32 (Last low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry above 207.86 on continuation.
- **Invalidation:** A close below 181.32.
---
### JPM (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result (Strength Confirmation)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is a wide spread UP bar on high volume (RelVol 1.51), closing near the high (CLV 0.83). This bar demonstrates strong demand entering the market, successfully reversing the sharp downturn seen in the previous two weeks (01/12 and 01/19 Supply Dominance signals). The strong close on good volume suggests supply absorption was successful, aligning with the overall bullish quarterly trend.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 324.25 (Last high), Support: 301.37 (Last low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry above 324.25, confirming break of the recent high.

---
### KDP (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Strength Confirmed / Test Success

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is a medium spread UP bar on below average volume (RelVol 0.69), closing high (CLV 0.61). This confirms demand strength and absorption, especially given the below-average volume (potential No Supply Test success). This action is consolidating the bullish move in the quarterly trend, despite the Monthly Buying Climax warning. Price is confirming institutional accumulation/continuation.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 28.70 (Last high), Support: 27.20 (Last low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry above 28.70 on confirming volume.
- **Invalidation:** A close below 27.20.
---
### KVYO (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Climax Action/Supply Dominance Continuation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is a wide spread DOWN bar on high volume (RelVol 1.48), closing near the low (CLV -0.76). This is relentless supply continuing the bearish quarterly trend. Although volume is high (potential Selling Climax), the close near the low shows supply is still in firm control, dominating the market and driving prices lower.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 23.43 (Last high), Support: 18.57 (Last low/Climax base)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry below 18.57, confirming breakdown.
- **Invalidation:** A close above 23.43.

The last weekly bar is a wide spread UP bar on high volume (RelVol 1.10), closing near the high (CLV 0.90). This confirms strong demand and continuation of the bullish quarterly trend. This strong bar overcomes the bearish signals from the previous two weeks (01/12 close near low and 01/19 weak close). The action suggests Smart Money is driving prices higher.

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is a wide spread UP bar on high volume (RelVol 2.38), closing near the high (CLV 0.74). This confirms strong demand and continuation of the bullish quarterly trend. This follows a previous high-volume bar (01/26, RelVol 1.78) which also closed high (CLV 0.78). This sequence suggests powerful institutional accumulation and markup, successfully absorbing any prior supply.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 220.42 (Last high), Support: 184.00 (Last low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry above 220.42 on continuation.

---
### NICE (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Strength Confirmed / Test Success

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is a wide spread UP bar on high volume (RelVol 1.56), closing high (CLV 0.56). This follows the massive drop and Supply Dominance bar on 01/26 (CLV -0.92). The strong response suggests successful absorption of that supply, confirming demand is back in control. Despite the bearish quarterly trend and confirmed monthly Supply Dominance, this weekly action is decisively bullish.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 113.85 (Last high), Support: 104.73 (Last low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry above 113.85 on continuation.

The last weekly bar is an extremely wide spread UP bar on high volume (RelVol 1.61), closing near the high (CLV 0.88). This is overwhelmingly bullish, confirming strong demand and continuation of the mark-up phase in the bullish quarterly trend. This follows the confirmed early Stopping Volume monthly sequence, indicating the reversal process is maturing into a strong uptrend.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 136.71 (Last high), Support: 119.16 (Last low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry above 136.71 on continuation.

---
### OMF (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Climax Action/Supply Dominance Continuation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is a wide spread DOWN bar on high volume (RelVol 2.21), closing mid-range (CLV -0.63). This high volume and wide spread suggests institutional liquidation and panic selling (Selling Climax potential), confirming the bearish quarterly trend. The close remains weak, showing supply dominance is in effect.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 66.26 (Last high), Support: 60.61 (Last low/Climax base)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short continuation entry below 60.61. Wait for a rally failure (No Demand) for an optimal short entry.
- **Invalidation:** A close above 66.26.
---
### ONB (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Absorption/Strength in Accumulation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stock is in a Quarterly BULLISH_TREND. The last weekly bar closed strong (CLV 0.69) on high relative volume (RelVol 1.19). This high volume up-close bar suggests strong buying interest overcoming recent resistance, despite the Monthly sequence indicating SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (which seems to be failing or absorbed by this recent strength). The volume confirms commitment to the upward move.

**Key Levels:** 26.17 (Recent High), 24.28 (Recent Low/Support), 24.43 (Previous Monthly Close Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 26.17 with confirming volume on daily chart, or successful retest of 24.50 area.
- **Invalidation:** 24.28 (Below last week's low)
---
### OZK (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply/Confirmed Strength

**Smart Money Logic:**
Despite the prior SUPPLY_DOMINANCE flag, the last weekly bar was exceptionally strong. It had a wide spread, very high CLV (0.98), and high relative volume (1.18), closing near the absolute high of the week (51.43). This is undeniable strong demand stepping in, confirming prior accumulation phases, and potentially negating the bear signal. This strength is powerful enough to ignore the choppy market context.

**Key Levels:** 51.43 (New High/Target), 46.99 (Low of Strong Bar Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 51.43 (new high) or retest and hold of the 50.00 psychological level.
- **Invalidation:** 46.99 (If price falls back into the accumulation range)
---
### PB (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume/Confirmed Strength

**Smart Money Logic:**
The previous week saw ultra-high volume (RelVol 2.38) with a very wide spread, closing mid-range (CLV -0.04), indicating strong supply or a shakeout (Stopping Volume). The subsequent bar (last week) was a massive reversal on high volume (RelVol 2.08), closing near the absolute high (CLV 0.90). This confirms institutional support and strong demand absorption at the lows (68.06). This is clear accumulation in a BULLISH_TREND.

**Key Levels:** 74.82 (Recent High), 71.04 (Swing Support), 68.07 (Stopping Volume Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 74.82, confirming the breakout from the accumulation base.
- **Invalidation:** 68.07 (Violation of the Stopping Volume low)
---
### RF (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Confirmed Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
RF is in a BULLISH_TREND. The last weekly bar had a wide spread on high volume (RelVol 0.90), closing exceptionally strong (CLV 0.82). This confirms strong demand and a successful breakout above recent consolidation/resistance (28.50 area). The move is likely to continue towards new highs, despite the Monthly flag for Supply Dominance which appears to have been absorbed.

**Key Levels:** 31.17 (New High/Target), 28.36 (Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry on a shallow pullback or break above 31.17.
- **Invalidation:** 28.36 (Below the low of the strength bar)
---
### RLI (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Confirmed Strength/Buying Return

**Smart Money Logic:**
Despite the BEARISH_TREND and Monthly SUPPLY_DOMINANCE, the last weekly bar showed high volume (RelVol 1.09) and a wide spread, closing strong (CLV 0.54). This volume confirms commitment to the upside and suggests the absorption of prior supply (especially from the week 2026-01-26, which had high volume and a neutral close). This is a strong demand signal challenging the bearish trend.

**Key Levels:** 62.78 (Recent High/Supply), 58.15 (Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 62.78, confirming further strength.
- **Invalidation:** 58.15 (Violation of the low of the strength bar)
---
### SA (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume/Confirmed Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
SA is in a BULLISH_TREND, but the Monthly sequence shows CONFIRMED_EARLY SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (indicated by the huge drop on week 2026-01-26 with CLV -0.97). The last bar showed high volume (RelVol 1.15), a wide spread, and closed strongly (CLV 0.55). This strong close following a major shakeout low (27.41) suggests institutional demand stepped in forcefully to absorb the selling. This is a clear Stopping Volume/Accumulation signal.

**Key Levels:** 30.75 (Supply Zone), 27.41 (Stopping Volume Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 30.75, confirming the breakout from the shakeout area.
- **Invalidation:** 27.41 (Violation of the low invalidates the accumulation thesis)
---
### TFX (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Confirmed Demand/Potential Accumulation

**Smart Money Logic:**
Despite the BEARISH_TREND, the last weekly bar showed high volume (RelVol 1.74) and a wide spread, closing exceptionally strong (CLV 0.85). This strong close signals powerful demand entering the market near the lows (101.65), overcoming several weeks of severe supply dominance. This is a major sign of strength and potential trend reversal.

**Key Levels:** 108.95 (Immediate Resistance), 101.65 (Accumulation Low Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and hold above 108.95 or entry on a shallow pullback to 105.00.
- **Invalidation:** 101.65 (Violation negates strength)
---
### TXT (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Confirmed Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
TXT is in a BULLISH_TREND. After a shakeout bar (CLV -0.34) the previous week, the latest bar showed high volume (RelVol 1.81) and a wide spread, closing extremely strong near the high (CLV 0.90). This indicates forceful institutional buying, confirming the shakeout (Stopping Volume) at 84.32 failed to attract further selling. Demand is clearly dominant.

**Key Levels:** 95.87 (New High/Target), 86.36 (Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 95.87 or entry on a shallow pullback.
- **Invalidation:** 86.36 (Violation of the low of the strength bar)
---
### UGI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax/No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
UGI is in a BULLISH_TREND but flashed a BUYING_CLIMAX signal previously (high volume, mid-close on week 2026-01-26). The last bar had high volume (RelVol 1.40) but closed at the absolute low of the bar (CLV -1.0), which is an extremely bearish sign. The high volume confirms institutional selling/distribution at the highs (40.97). The price attempted to open strong but was aggressively sold down, resulting in 'Effort No Result' for the bulls.

**Key Levels:** 40.98 (Climax High Resistance), 37.09 (Recent Close/Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 37.09, confirming markdown.
- **Invalidation:** 40.98 (If price breaks the climax high, the signal is negated)
---
### USIG (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Confirmed Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
USIG operates in a BULLISH_TREND and ETF environment (USIG is likely a bond/fixed income ETF, suggesting stability). The last bar saw high volume (RelVol 1.48) but a very narrow spread, closing near the absolute high (CLV 0.93). The high volume spike closing strong in such a tight range suggests professional buying absorbing any residual supply quickly. This confirms demand dominance and continuation potential.

**Key Levels:** 51.93 (New High/Target), 51.63 (Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 51.93 for continuation.
- **Invalidation:** 51.63 (If violated, suggests hidden supply)
---
### WHR (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume/Confirmed Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
WHR is in a BULLISH_TREND. Following a large distribution/shakeout bar (CLV 0.11 on RelVol 2.14), the latest bar showed high volume (RelVol 1.44), a wide spread, and closed strongly (CLV 0.58). This is powerful institutional demand absorbing the previous supply and driving the price higher, confirming accumulation/stopping volume near 77.61. Demand is dominant.

**Key Levels:** 88.85 (Recent High/Target), 77.61 (Stopping Volume Low Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 88.85 or entry on a shallow pullback.
- **Invalidation:** 77.61 (Violation of the low of the strength bar)
---
### WRB (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Demand Confirmation / Follow-Through Bar

**Smart Money Logic:**
The decline was halted by a high-volume, wide-spread bar on 01-26, suggesting stopping volume and absorption of supply. The subsequent bar (02-02) confirmed demand by rallying strongly on wide spread and closing near the high, despite slightly lower volume. This suggests the prior Monthly Supply Dominance is being negated by renewed demand.

**Key Levels:** 65.00 (Major Support), 71.90 (Recent High/Target), 68.00 (Consolidation Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and hold above 71.90
- **Invalidation:** 67.50
---
### ZM (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Confirmation / Effort No Result (Churning)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The 01-26 bar was a Buying Climax (extreme volume, wide spread, weak close relative to high). The following bar (02-02) maintained near-climax volume but failed to significantly exceed the previous week's high, confirming heavy supply entering the market. This high-volume churning in the 92-97 region signals active distribution by Smart Money.

**Key Levels:** 97.58 (Climax Resistance), 91.69 (Immediate Support), 86.40 (Climax Week Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close below 91.00
- **Invalidation:** 98.00
---
## 👀 Watch/Monitoring
### ABT (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Watch for Test (Supply Dominance)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stock experienced a very wide spread down candle on high volume (Weekly 2026-01-19, RelVol 2.57) indicating heavy selling (Supply). The subsequent two weeks (2026-01-26, 2026-02-02) saw attempts to rally (up close) on high volume (RelVol 2.37, 1.94), but the spread narrowed significantly in the latest week compared to the initial down move. This suggests possible lack of strong follow-through buying or continued pressure/testing of the supply zone. The Quarterly context is BEARISH, reinforcing the supply pressure.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 111.06 (Last Weekly High), Support: 105.27 (Weekly Low), Supply Zone: 120.00 - 128.80 (Recent Major Supply)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Failure to breach 111.06 or a wide spread down week on high volume below 105.27.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 115.00
---
### ABVX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Confirmed Strong)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly chart detected a Buying Climax. The recent action shows erratic, volatile behavior (Weekly 2026-01-05: huge spread down on high volume, CLV -0.54), followed by a massive shakeout. The latest weekly candle (2026-02-02) is a wide spread up on low RelVol (0.61), but contextually, the previous month showed strong supply dominance (Monthly CLV -0.85). The market is in a deep Quarterly BEARISH TREND. The sharp drop in late January followed by a high CLV bounce suggests a possible reaction move against major monthly supply.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 125.86 (Recent Weekly High), Support: 107.42 (Last Weekly Low), Climax Zone: 130.00 - 138.69

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below 107.42 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 126.00
---
### ACLX (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result Down (Monthly Context)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the Monthly sequence is SUPPLY DOMINANCE (Watch for Test). Weekly 2026-01-19 showed a huge spread up (10.5) but closed near the low (CLV -0.67), indicating significant selling, although volume was not extremely high (RelVol 1.51). The latest weekly bar (2026-02-02) is also wide spread down (4.8), closing near the low (CLV -0.33), but volume is near average (RelVol 0.98). This suggests the recent bullish attempt failed, and supply is likely still present overhead (Monthly Supply Dominance confirmed). The last bar indicates weakness, but not panic selling yet.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 76.50 (Supply Peak), Support: 66.44 (Last Weekly Low), Accumulation Base: 60.35 - 63.33

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Sustained close below 66.44 or a strong test of supply (76.50) with low volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 71.25
---
### ACWX (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH. The weekly chart shows a strong move up with high volume (2026-01-05, 01-12, 01-19, all high RelVol), culminating in a narrow spread down week (2026-01-26, CLV -0.68) on high volume (RelVol 1.91) signaling Buying Climax/Distribution. The latest week (2026-02-02) is a wide spread up on slightly lower volume (RelVol 1.57), closing near the high (CLV 0.97). This suggests demand is fighting back against the perceived distribution, typical of a choppy consolidation phase following a climax. Smart money needs to resolve the distribution overhead.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 72.33 (Recent High/Climax), Support: 70.30 (Last Weekly Low), Range Low: 68.30

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 72.33 on very high volume (Demand confirmation) or sustained failure to hold 70.30.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 70.00
---
### AGIO (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Failed Attempt)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BEARISH, but the Monthly chart is signaling Stopping Volume. However, the last weekly candle (2026-02-02) is a wide spread down on high volume (RelVol 0.95), closing sharply at the bottom (CLV -0.92). This suggests the previous attempts by demand failed, and sellers regained control late in the move, potentially negating the early Stopping Volume signal. The recent large down bar indicates strong supply remaining.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Resistance: 28.71, Support: 26.45 (Last Weekly Low), Monthly Stopping Zone: 26.25 - 27.44

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below 26.45 on high volume (markdown confirmation).
- **Invalidation:** Close above 29.00
---
### AHR (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BULLISH. Weekly 2026-01-26 showed high volume (RelVol 3.99) but the close was neutral (CLV 0.15), suggesting heavy buying followed by immediate selling pressure or supply absorbing the demand (Buying Climax). The latest week (2026-02-02) rallied back up on high volume (RelVol 1.59), closing strongly near the high (CLV 0.56). This indicates persistent demand. However, the sheer volume on the 01-26 bar suggests potential distribution that needs a successful test or a breakout above the climax high.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 49.53 (Climax High), Support: 46.07, Climax Volume Base: 45.37 - 48.04

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Successful high volume test/break above 49.53 or a low volume No Demand test of 46.07.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 45.00
---
### AIG (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Confirmed Early)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BEARISH, but the recent weekly action is mixed. Weekly 2026-01-05 showed clear supply (wide spread down, high volume, CLV -0.92). The price then consolidated. The last two weeks (01-26, 02-02) showed strong up moves (CLV 0.96, 0.60) on below average and slightly above average volume, respectively. This suggests demand is stepping in for a reaction rally against the supply confirmed in early January. While the overall Quarterly context remains bearish, this immediate move is bullish until it hits new supply.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Resistance: 77.52 (Last Weekly High), Support: 73.50, Supply Zone: 80.00 - 85.69

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Test of 77.52 resistance on low volume (No Demand).
- **Invalidation:** Sustained close above 80.00
---
### AIQ (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS)
**VSA Status:** Monthly Buying Climax (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BEARISH. Monthly analysis suggests a potential Buying Climax that failed (January CLV -0.28). The latest weekly action (2026-02-02) saw a wide spread down on above average volume (RelVol 1.19), closing near the low (CLV -0.19). This high volume down bar confirms supply is present. Given the underlying BEARISH Quarterly context, the attempt to mark up is failing, but the current low volume consolidation suggests a possible Test or pullback before the next move.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Resistance: 52.72, Support: 48.28 (Last Weekly Low), Climax High: 53.94

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below 48.28 on increasing volume (Markdown).
- **Invalidation:** Close above 53.00
---
### ALC (NEUTRAL/BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Confirmed Early)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the recent Monthly sequence suggests Stopping Volume (accumulation within the bullish trend, possibly a sign of profit-taking being absorbed). The last weekly bar (2026-02-02) is a wide spread down on very high volume (RelVol 1.53), but the close is significantly off the low (CLV 0.175), suggesting powerful buying absorption (Stopping Volume). This is a potential accumulation signal within the larger bullish context.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Resistance: 80.15, Support: 76.95 (Stopping Volume Low), Accumulation Range: 76.95 - 82.50

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A tight spread bar on low volume (No Supply) testing the 76.95 area.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 76.00
---
### ALL (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Confirmed Early)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the stock saw a major Supply signal in mid-January (2026-01-12, wide spread down, RelVol 2.04, CLV -0.94). This sharp drop was followed by two weeks of recovery attempts on below-average volume. The latest bar (2026-02-02) is a wide spread up on high volume (RelVol 1.72), but the close is neutral (CLV 0.007). This indicates the rally hit resistance and supply absorbed the buying, leading to a weak close despite the volume. This suggests the January markdown still holds relevance.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 216.75 (Last Weekly High), Support: 198.22 (Last Weekly Low), Supply Zone: 210.72 - 215.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Failure to breach 216.75 followed by a drop below 198.22.
- **Invalidation:** Sustained close above 217.00
---
### AMBA (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH, characterized by a sharp drop in early January (2026-01-05). The last two weeks saw low volume pullback/consolidation, followed by a wide spread up on high volume (RelVol 1.16) in the latest week (2026-02-02), closing strongly off the low (CLV 0.44). This might be a reaction rally or short covering. The price needs to overcome the defined supply zones near $70 to change the short-term bias, but the overall context remains bearish.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Resistance: 65.57, Support: 58.58 (Last Weekly Low), Supply Zone: 68.48 - 70.77

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Test of 65.57 on low volume (No Demand) or a break below 58.58.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 71.00
---
### AMH (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Confirmed Early)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH, but both Weekly and Monthly charts show Stopping Volume. Weekly 2026-02-02 is a narrow spread bar on high volume (RelVol 1.40), closing exactly in the middle (CLV 0.014). This high volume, neutral close suggests a fight between supply and demand, absorbing prior selling pressure (Stopping Volume). The lack of momentum (low spread) indicates the market is pausing near support, potentially setting up for a Test phase.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Resistance: 31.53, Support/Stopping Zone: 30.13 - 30.60, Supply Zone: 32.45 - 32.65

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Low volume No Supply test of 30.13, followed by demand confirmation.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 29.80
---
### AMKR (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS)
**VSA Status:** Monthly Buying Climax (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH. The stock saw a wide spread down on high volume in mid-January (2026-01-12, RelVol 1.39, CLV -0.66), indicating distribution/supply. However, the latest weekly bar (2026-02-02) is a very wide spread up on high volume (RelVol 1.48), closing near the high (CLV 0.83). This signals strong demand entering, potentially negating or testing the earlier supply. This looks like aggressive re-accumulation or a violent secondary test within the existing bullish trend.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 49.99, Support: 42.14 (Last Weekly Low), Demand Zone: 42.14 - 45.45

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 49.99 on strong volume, or a low volume pullback to 45.00.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 46.50
---
### AMSC (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Confirmed Weakness)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BEARISH. The Weekly chart detected Stopping Volume, but the latest bar (2026-02-02) is a very wide spread down on extremely high volume (RelVol 2.22), closing mid-range (CLV -0.05). Although the CLV suggests some buying absorption (Stopping Volume attempt), the massive spread and volume indicate overwhelming supply pressure breaking through support. The high volume failure suggests further weakness is imminent despite the stopping volume label.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Resistance: 31.85, Support: 24.87 (Last Weekly Low), Failure Level: 30.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below 24.87 on confirmation volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 32.00
---
### APLS (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BEARISH. The stock saw massive supply in mid-January (2026-01-12: wide spread down, RelVol 1.54, CLV -0.94). This was followed by high volume buying (2026-01-26, RelVol 2.29) which resulted in a mild up close (CLV 0.10), suggesting absorption. The latest bar (2026-02-02) is a strong up close on low volume (RelVol 1.01), showing demand control. The price action is consolidating below resistance after a sharp drop, indicating a potential Accumulation/Secondary Test phase. The overall BEARISH Quarterly context suggests caution.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 24.10, Support: 21.59, Accumulation Range: 19.26 - 24.10

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 24.10 on high volume (Bullish continuation).
- **Invalidation:** Close below 21.00
---
### APO (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BEARISH. The latest weekly bar (2026-02-02) is a very wide spread down on extremely high volume (RelVol 2.17), but the close is significantly off the low (CLV 0.51). This is a strong classic Stopping Volume signal, indicating institutional buyers absorbed massive selling. This suggests a potential turning point or a significant automatic rally is due, but requires a successful Test before confirming accumulation.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Resistance: 136.58, Support/Stopping Zone: 122.06 (Last Weekly Low), Supply Zone: 139.94 - 143.68

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A tight spread bar on low volume (No Supply) testing 122.06 or a break above 136.58.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 121.00
---
### ARE (NEUTRAL/BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Confirmed Early)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BULLISH. The monthly chart confirmed Stopping Volume, indicating accumulation is occurring. Weekly 2026-01-26 was a wide spread down on high volume (RelVol 1.53, CLV -0.54), but the subsequent bar (2026-02-02) saw a narrower spread up bar on average volume (RelVol 0.98), closing strongly near the high (CLV 0.63). This suggests demand absorbed the selling from the prior week's shakeout. The bullish quarterly trend supports accumulation.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Resistance: 56.52, Support/Accumulation Range: 53.14 - 54.64, Supply Zone: 59.76

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close above 56.52, confirming the rally off the accumulation base.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 53.00
---
### AS (NEUTRAL/BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Monthly Supply Dominance (Confirmed Early)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the Monthly chart suggests confirmed Supply Dominance. However, the last weekly bar (2026-02-02) is a wide spread up on high volume (RelVol 1.26), closing strongly near the high (CLV 0.58). This demand signal suggests the rally off the recent low is gaining traction, potentially confirming accumulation within the overall bullish quarterly trend, despite the monthly warning. The action needs to overcome resistance.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Resistance: 38.91, Support: 34.82 (Last Weekly Low), Supply Zone: 38.91 - 40.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close above 38.91 on confirmation volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 36.30
---
### ASML (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BULLISH. The stock has seen extremely high volume and wide spreads (2026-01-05, 01-12, 01-26), characteristic of a Climax. Weekly 2026-01-26 showed high volume (RelVol 1.96) but a poor close (CLV -0.30) after making a new high, suggesting institutional selling (Distribution). The latest bar (2026-02-02) is a wide spread down on high volume (RelVol 1.51), but the close is middle/high (CLV 0.41), showing a mix of supply/demand. This volatility and high volume near highs suggests distribution/churning is underway.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 1493.48 (Climax High), Support: 1316.06, Distribution Zone: 1385.16 - 1493.48

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and sustained close below 1316.06.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 1500.00
---
### ATO (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BULLISH. The high volume bars (2026-01-19 RelVol 1.77, 2026-01-26 RelVol 2.27) followed by the high close in the latest week (2026-02-02, CLV 0.36, RelVol 1.69) suggest an active distribution phase near the highs. The wide spread up bar in the latest week attempts to break the high but fails to close near it despite strong volume, indicating persistent supply absorption (Upthrust/Climax).

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 174.57 (Climax High), Support: 164.50 (Last Weekly Low), Distribution Zone: 169.40 - 174.57

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Failure to breach 174.57, followed by a break below 164.50 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 175.00
---
### AVGX (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Failed Attempt)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BEARISH. The latest weekly bar (2026-02-02) is a very wide spread down on high volume (RelVol 1.88), but it managed to close well off the low (CLV 0.65). This is a strong classic Stopping Volume signal, indicating demand absorption of major supply. This is a potential accumulation signal, suggesting a strong automatic rally or short covering is likely next.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Resistance: 43.85, Support/Stopping Zone: 33.08 (Last Weekly Low), Supply Zone: 49.16 - 50.11

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A low volume No Supply test of 33.08, or a break above 43.85.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 32.50
---
### BABX (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS)
**VSA Status:** Monthly Supply Dominance (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BEARISH. Monthly confirmed Supply Dominance. Weekly 2026-01-26 was a wide spread down on high volume (RelVol 1.18), closing near the low (CLV -0.88), confirming supply presence. The latest bar (2026-02-02) is a wide spread down on below average volume (RelVol 0.79), closing mid-range (CLV -0.12). The general action indicates bearish consolidation after a rally attempt failed. Supply remains dominant.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Resistance: 46.61, Support: 39.71 (Last Weekly Low), Supply Zone: 46.86 - 53.11

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below 39.71 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 47.00

### BAM (NEUTRAL/BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BEARISH. Weekly 2026-01-26 showed high volume selling (RelVol 1.56, CLV -0.79). The latest bar (2026-02-02) is a very wide spread down on extremely high volume (RelVol 2.42), but the close is significantly off the low (CLV 0.38). This is a strong Stopping Volume signal, indicating aggressive absorption of supply by professional money. This marks a potential accumulation point, counter-trend but supported by massive demand.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Resistance: 50.88, Support/Stopping Zone: 46.76 (Last Weekly Low), Supply Zone: 52.21 - 52.78

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Low volume No Supply test of 46.76 or a break above 50.88.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 46.50
---
### BE (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BULLISH. The monthly chart confirmed Stopping Volume, suggesting accumulation. However, the latest weekly bar (2026-02-02) is a very wide spread down on extremely high volume (RelVol 1.39), closing near the low (CLV -0.49). While the spread is massive (typical of a shakeout in accumulation), the weak close suggests the accumulation is not yet confirmed, and supply still holds significant control. The volatility is extreme, warranting caution.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Resistance: 176.49 (Last Weekly High), Support/Stopping Zone: 131.66 (Last Weekly Low), Major Supply Zone: 155.87 - 167.57

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Low volume No Supply test of 131.66 or a strong high-volume close above 155.00.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 128.00
---
### BKKT (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax/Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly chart indicates a confirmed Buying Climax in January (high volume, wide spread up, CLV -0.44). The most recent weekly bar (2026-02-02) shows a narrow spread down bar finishing mid-range on high volume (CLV 0.29), possibly marking a short-term Stopping Volume or Test after the previous two weeks of downward price movement. The low volume suggests weakness is subsiding, but the lack of immediate strength makes the verdict NEUTRAL, awaiting confirmation of accumulation.

**Key Levels:** Key Support: 9.89 (Weekly Low), Resistance: 15.61 (Previous High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 13.00 on increasing volume, confirming a move away from the low.
- **Invalidation:** Below 9.89 (Recent Low)
---
### BKSY (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result / Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly chart signaled a confirmed Buying Climax in January. The last week (2026-02-02) shows a wide spread up bar closing mid-high (CLV 0.54) on very high volume (RelVol 1.28). This suggests significant effort to push price up, but the close is not near the high, which is typical of a high-volume Test after a sharp drop (Supply/Effort No Result). The move recovered from the previous week's WSD down close (CLV -0.91), indicating support found near 19.31.

**Key Levels:** Support: 19.31 (Recent Low), Resistance: 23.87 / 28.29

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 23.88 on confirming volume to negate the climax area.
- **Invalidation:** Below 19.31
---
### BL (NEUTRAL/BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Selling Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence is showing heavy Supply Dominance (WSD down, high volume, low CLV in Jan/Feb). The last bar (2026-02-02) is a wide spread down bar on high volume (RelVol 1.94), but the close is off the low (CLV -0.27), suggesting possible professional buying (Stopping Volume). However, the overall quarterly trend is BEARISH, and the immediate price action is dominated by high-volume selling. We must confirm absorption before turning bullish.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Support: 41.56 (Low of recent bar), Immediate Resistance: 47.85

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Strong rally (WSU, high CLV) on low or average volume, followed by a successful Test of the low.
- **Invalidation:** Break below 41.56
---
### BLSH (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stock is in a BEARISH Quarterly Trend and the last weekly bar (2026-02-02) exhibits classic Stopping Volume characteristics: wide spread down on extremely high volume (RelVol 1.99), closing off the absolute low (CLV -0.04). This suggests significant absorption of supply by Smart Money near the 24.79 level. The monthly chart confirms this move, showing a wide down bar closing off the lows on the highest relative volume.

**Key Levels:** Key Accumulation Level: 24.79, Immediate Resistance: 30.38

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A low-volume Test of the 24.79 area, followed by a break above the short-term high of 30.38.
- **Invalidation:** Clear break and close below 24.79
---
### BN (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Effort No Result Down

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar (2026-02-02) is a WSD down, high volume (RelVol 1.96), but the close is mid-range (CLV -0.13). This volume spike, near recent lows in a short-term bearish sequence, suggests potential Stopping Volume/absorption by Smart Money. However, the last two weeks saw high volume on downward movement, implying significant supply is still present. Wait for a clear sign of weakness drying up.

**Key Levels:** Support: 43.99 (Stopping Volume Low), Resistance: 46.80

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A successful Test of 43.99 on low volume, followed by subsequent strength above 45.50.
- **Invalidation:** Break below 43.99
---
### BOX (NEUTRAL/BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar (2026-02-02) shows Stopping Volume: wide spread down bar on very high relative volume (1.92), closing well off the low (CLV -0.11). This dramatic volume spike suggests aggressive institutional accumulation near 23.70, effectively pausing the recent bearish decline signaled by the earlier Supply Dominance warnings.

**Key Levels:** Accumulation Low: 23.70, Resistance: 25.88 / 27.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A low-volume Test of 23.70-24.00 area, confirming demand is holding.
- **Invalidation:** Break below 23.70
---
### BRBR (NEUTRAL/BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax / Monthly Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar (2026-02-02) is a very wide spread down bar, closing near the low (CLV -0.94) on extremely high volume (RelVol 2.07). This is a classic Selling Climax, indicating panic selling and aggressive absorption by Smart Money. The Monthly sequence confirms this massive Stopping Volume action. The high volume move suggests the downside momentum has been exhausted.

**Key Levels:** Climax Low: 19.35, Initial Resistance: 25.06

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Confirmation of a successful Test of 19.35, followed by strength above 20.50 on low volume.
- **Invalidation:** Clear break below 19.35
---
### BRZE (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
The price has been heavily suppressed, showing Supply Dominance. The last weekly bar (2026-02-02) is a very wide spread down bar on extreme volume (RelVol 2.49), closing off the absolute low (CLV -0.78). This suggests a Selling Climax event, where heavy selling met strong Smart Money absorption. The monthly chart confirms this extreme selling pressure.

**Key Levels:** Climax Low: 17.28, Resistance: 22.12

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Look for a low-volume test of the 17.28 level, followed by decisive strength above 19.50.
- **Invalidation:** Break below 17.28
---
### BSY (NEUTRAL/BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
The price action suggests a Stopping Volume event after consistent downward movement. The last bar (2026-02-02) shows a wide spread on high volume (RelVol 1.81), closing mid-range (CLV 0.01). This neutral close, coupled with the high volume, suggests a successful absorption/test of selling pressure near 30.96. The quarterly trend is bearish, but signs of accumulation are appearing.

**Key Levels:** Accumulation Low: 30.96, Resistance: 35.32

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 35.32 on confirming volume, or a tight range consolidation above 32.00.
- **Invalidation:** Break below 30.96
---
### BWIN (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence shows significant Supply Dominance. The last weekly bar (2026-02-02) is a wide spread down bar on very high volume (RelVol 2.15), closing mid-range (CLV -0.56). This points to heavy supply meeting aggressive institutional demand, forming a Selling Climax near 18.62. The monthly chart also reinforces the idea of persistent supply.

**Key Levels:** Climax Low: 18.62, Resistance: 22.91

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Successful low-volume Test near 18.62, followed by subsequent rally above 21.00.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 18.62
---
### BXSL (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar (2026-02-02) is a wide spread down bar on extremely high volume (RelVol 2.0), closing mid-range (CLV 0.07). This high-volume move, particularly the bounce off the low (24.17), suggests significant Stopping Volume/Smart Money buying interest at this low level, potentially ending the recent downtrend pressure.

**Key Levels:** Accumulation Low: 24.17, Resistance: 25.66

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Confirmation of a successful Test of 24.17 on very low volume.
- **Invalidation:** Break below 24.17
---
### CADE (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Selling Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
The previous week (2026-01-19) was a potential Buying Climax (wide spread, low CLV -0.98) followed by the latest bar (2026-01-26) which is a wide spread down bar on exceptional volume (RelVol 4.79), closing mid-range (CLV -0.48). This massive volume spike suggests a Selling Climax in response to the prior week's rejection, indicating aggressive institutional repositioning (distribution/accumulation fight). The context is highly volatile.

**Key Levels:** Support: 41.59 (Climax Low), Resistance: 46.74 (Climax High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for tight consolidation and a clear Test of the low volume zone.
- **Invalidation:** Break above 46.74 or below 41.59
---
### CAI (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar (2026-02-02) is a narrow spread down bar on high volume (RelVol 1.73), closing mid-range (CLV -0.41). This follows a sharp decline, suggesting Stopping Volume near 21.18. Smart Money is likely absorbing the supply as the stock approaches new lows in a bearish quarterly trend. The lack of extreme low close indicates immediate selling pressure may be waning.

**Key Levels:** Accumulation Low: 21.18, Resistance: 23.99

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Low volume Test of 21.18, followed by a move above 23.00.
- **Invalidation:** Break below 21.18
---
### CARG (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stock has been under Supply Dominance pressure. The last weekly bar (2026-02-02) is a very wide spread down bar on very high volume (RelVol 1.89). However, the close is significantly off the low (CLV -0.59), indicating a potential Selling Climax event where institutional buying absorbed the panic selling near 27.56.

**Key Levels:** Climax Low: 27.57, Resistance: 32.69

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a successful low-volume Test of 27.57 followed by sustained strength.
- **Invalidation:** Break below 27.57
---
### CCI (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Selling Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar (2026-02-02) is a wide spread down bar on extremely high volume (RelVol 2.52), closing off the low (CLV -0.24). This heavy activity near the lows (77.01) strongly suggests a Selling Climax, where institutional sellers dumped shares into institutional demand. The lack of a true 'no supply' test means we must wait for confirmation.

**Key Levels:** Climax Low: 77.01, Resistance: 87.31

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Successful low-volume Test of 77.01 or decisive close above 82.00.
- **Invalidation:** Break below 77.01
---
### CCOI (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Weakness / Buying Climax Failure

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly chart signaled a Buying Climax, suggesting potential reversal. The last weekly bar (2026-02-02) is a wide spread up bar on high volume (RelVol 0.95), but the close is weak (CLV 0.22). This suggests Effort No Result Up, meaning Smart Money exerted effort to push the price higher (volume) but failed to achieve a high close (result). This weakness confirms the struggle within the monthly climax area.

**Key Levels:** Support: 22.31, Resistance: 25.55

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Decisive close above 25.55 or clear break below 22.31.
- **Invalidation:** Below 22.31
---
### CDE (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Selling Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stock experienced extreme volatility. Week 2026-01-26 showed a dramatic Buying Climax reversal (WSD down, extreme volume, CLV -0.89). The latest bar (2026-02-02) is a wide spread up bar on extremely high volume (RelVol 1.73), closing high (CLV 0.54), attempting to negate the prior selling pressure. This high-volume, wide spread action signals a major battle (Selling Climax Reversal) near 19.08. Wait for resolution.

**Key Levels:** Support: 19.08, Resistance: 22.13

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A definitive move away from the high volume area (e.g., strong close above 22.13).
- **Invalidation:** Close below 19.08
---
### CDNS (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax / Extreme Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stock is in a BEARISH Quarterly Trend. The last weekly bar (2026-02-02) is a wide spread down bar on massive volume (RelVol 2.5), closing mid-range (CLV 0.23). While the close off the low (262.75) suggests Stopping Volume, the extreme volume and wide spread (33.58) indicate overwhelming supply still in the market. The high volume move breaks several recent supports.

**Key Levels:** Climax Low: 262.75, Immediate Resistance: 296.34

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A failure to rally quickly, or a break below 262.75.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 296.34
---
### CEG (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Selling Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
The recent weekly bars show persistent downward pressure (BEARISH Quarterly Trend). The last bar (2026-02-02) is an extremely wide spread down bar on very high volume (RelVol 2.13), closing off the low (CLV -0.08). This suggests a Selling Climax event where professional money absorbed massive supply near 243.30. The magnitude of the spread and volume points to a major turning point, but confirmation is required.

**Key Levels:** Climax Low: 243.30, Resistance: 282.98

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Successful Test of 243.30 on low volume, followed by strength above 265.00.
- **Invalidation:** Break below 243.30
---
### CIVI (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly chart detected a Buying Climax. The bar on 2026-01-26 is a wide spread up bar on exceptional volume (RelVol 2.71), but closing mid-range (CLV -0.42). This signals a massive distribution effort by Smart Money near the high of 29.20. The volume spike is a classic indication of SM offloading positions into exuberant retail buying.

**Key Levels:** Resistance (Distribution High): 29.20, Support: 26.64

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 26.64, confirming distribution is complete.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 29.20
---
### CORT (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume Reversal/Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
The recent volatility suggests a major battle (Monthly Buying Climax confirmed). The current weekly bar (2026-02-02) is a narrow spread up bar on high volume (RelVol 1.26), closing mid-range (CLV 0.31). This follows a sharp rally (01-19) and subsequent pullback (01-26, CLV -0.40). The current bar is an ambiguous 'test' of the recent demand, lacking decisive close action despite volume. Requires confirmation.

**Key Levels:** Support: 38.10, Resistance: 42.26

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Decisive WSU bar above 42.26.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 38.10
---
### CPNG (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax / Effort No Result Down

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stock is in a BEARISH Quarterly Trend and subject to continuous Supply Dominance. The last weekly bar (2026-02-02) is a wide spread down bar on record volume (RelVol 2.58), closing mid-range/low (CLV -0.45). While the volume spike suggests a Selling Climax, the effort resulted in a sharp drop, confirming persistent bearish pressure. The overall picture suggests heavy distribution continuing, or a climactic bottom that has failed to immediately rally.

**Key Levels:** Support: 16.74 (Climax Low), Resistance: 20.34

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 16.74, confirming the Selling Climax failed to hold support.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 20.34
---
### CTSH (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stock is in a BEARISH Quarterly Trend. The last weekly bar (2026-02-02) is a very wide spread down bar on extreme volume (RelVol 1.90), closing mid-range (CLV -0.14). This high volume activity suggests a potential Selling Climax, indicating strong professional buying interest absorbing supply near 72.06, potentially ending the short-term decline.

**Key Levels:** Accumulation Low: 72.06, Resistance: 81.43

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A successful low-volume Test of 72.06, followed by a sustained rally above 78.00.
- **Invalidation:** Break below 72.06
---
### CUZ (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Weakness

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly chart previously signaled a Buying Climax. The last bar (2026-02-02) is a narrow spread up bar on high volume (RelVol 2.26), closing mid-range (CLV 0.21). High volume with only a moderate result (Effort No Result Up) suggests persistent supply is meeting the buying effort, confirming distribution or stalling within the climax area. This indicates short-term weakness despite the bullish quarterly trend.

**Key Levels:** Support: 24.72, Resistance: 26.23

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Decisive break above 26.23 to confirm strength, or failure below 24.72.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 24.72
---
### DOCU (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stock is in a BEARISH Quarterly Trend and Supply Dominance sequence. The last weekly bar (2026-02-02) is a very wide spread down bar on very high volume (RelVol 2.05), closing mid-range (CLV -0.48). This is a strong indicator of a Selling Climax, suggesting that Smart Money initiated massive absorption of supply near the 45.00 level. The bearish momentum has likely been temporarily halted.

**Key Levels:** Climax Low: 45.00, Resistance: 53.28

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A low-volume Test of 45.00, followed by a sustained move above 49.00.
- **Invalidation:** Break below 45.00
---
### DUOL (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stock is in a BEARISH Quarterly Trend. The last weekly bar (2026-02-02) is a massive wide spread down bar on extremely high volume (RelVol 2.17), closing mid-range (CLV -0.42). This signals a Selling Climax, with major supply being absorbed by Smart Money near 112.41. The intensity of the volume suggests a turning point, but the overall bearish trend requires confirmation of accumulation.

**Key Levels:** Climax Low: 112.41, Resistance: 136.54

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Successful low-volume Test of 112.41, followed by a rally above 125.00.
- **Invalidation:** Break below 112.41
---
### EGO (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
The price action reversed sharply after a recent high, with the last bar (2026-02-02) showing a wide spread down bar on very high volume (RelVol 2.23), closing mid-range (CLV -0.04). This spike in volume at the low suggests a Selling Climax/Stopping Volume event near 36.40, likely halting the aggressive selling that followed the high on 01-26 (Buying Climax/Effort No Result).

**Key Levels:** Climax Low: 36.40, Resistance: 41.86

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A successful Test of 36.40 on low volume, followed by strength above 39.50.
- **Invalidation:** Break below 36.40
---
### EQH (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar (2026-02-02) is a wide spread down bar on high volume (RelVol 1.82), closing mid-range (CLV 0.35). The fact that the close is significantly off the low (42.37) signals a powerful Stopping Volume event, where Smart Money aggressively absorbed supply. This interrupts the bearish quarterly context and suggests a potential floor is being established.

**Key Levels:** Accumulation Low: 42.37, Resistance: 47.01

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Successful low-volume Test of 42.37, followed by sustained strength above 46.50.
- **Invalidation:** Break below 42.37
---
### ETHA (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax / Extreme Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar (2026-02-02) is a wide spread down bar on staggering volume (RelVol 2.17, highest in the data set), closing mid-range (CLV -0.19). This is a textbook, massive Selling Climax. The extreme volume indicates a total capitulation event and aggressive absorption by Smart Money near 13.77. Given the context, accumulation is likely underway, but the sheer volatility requires caution.

**Key Levels:** Climax Low: 13.77, Resistance: 18.11

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a successful Test of 13.77, possibly a move above 16.00 on low volume.
- **Invalidation:** Break below 13.77
---
### EXPE (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax / Extreme Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stock is in a BEARISH Quarterly Trend. The last weekly bar (2026-02-02) is an extremely wide spread down bar on massive volume (RelVol 2.27), closing mid-range (CLV -0.49). Similar to other names, this is a major Supply Dominance event that also presents signs of a Selling Climax near 221.92. However, the downside magnitude suggests heavy distribution/panic selling is prevailing, confirming the bearish trend.

**Key Levels:** New Resistance: 276.54, Support/Low: 221.93

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Weak rally failure below 250.00, or confirmed break below 221.93.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 276.54
---
### FFIV (NEUTRAL/BULLISH Watch)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Supply Absorption

**Smart Money Logic:**
The most recent weekly bar is a wide spread bar (Spread 16.01) on moderate volume (RelVol 0.81), closing mid-range (CLV -0.06). This action follows the huge spread, ultra-high volume bar of 01/26, which closed near the low (CLV -0.34) suggesting major supply (Stopping Volume/Upthrust). The latest bar holds the gain, showing high volatility but managing to close slightly up. The volume is below average after the massive volume spike, suggesting supply pressure is easing but Smart Money needs to confirm demand. Monthly sequence is confirmed early Stopping Volume, supporting a longer-term bottoming process.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 285.09 (Last high), Support: 269.08 (Last low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Confirmation requires a narrow spread up bar on low volume, or a break above 285.09 on confirmed effort.
- **Invalidation:** A break and close below 269.00.
---
### FIBK (NEUTRAL/BEARISH Watch)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result (Potential Supply)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is a wide spread UP bar on high volume (RelVol 1.34), but the price closed mid-to-high range (CLV 0.80). This initially looks bullish (Effort/Result), but the context of the prior week (01/26) was a wide spread down on high volume closing at the extreme low (CLV -0.94), which signaled heavy supply. The last bar is a strong counter-move, but the high volume suggests Smart Money may be distributing into this strength (Buying Climax monthly context). We need confirmation that the supply from 01/26 has been fully overcome.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 39.17 (Last high), Support: 35.47 (Prior low close/major support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for clear continuation above 39.17 or a weak subsequent bar (e.g., narrow spread down on high volume).
- **Invalidation:** A close below 38.00 would indicate supply is winning; A close below 35.47 would confirm strong weakness.
---
### FISV (BEARISH Watch (Potential reversal setup developing))
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Selling Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is a wide spread DOWN bar on ultra-high volume (RelVol 1.31), closing off the absolute low (CLV -0.25). This high volume/wide spread action closing mid-to-low suggests either panic selling (Selling Climax) or relentless supply continuation. Given the bearish quarterly trend and Supply Dominance monthly context, this volume likely represents exhaustion of weak holders, but also significant institutional selling. The close slightly off the low is the only potential mitigating factor. Need confirmation of demand entering next week.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 63.75 (Last high), Support: 57.79 (Last low/Climax support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a clear sign of demand absorption (e.g., No Supply test or immediate reversal). Short continuation below 57.79.
- **Invalidation:** Short invalidation above 63.75; Long invalidation below 57.79.
---
### GBCI (NEUTRAL/BEARISH Watch)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result (Potential Blow-Off Top)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is a wide spread UP bar on extremely high volume (RelVol 1.96), closing near the high (CLV 0.56). This usually indicates strength, but given the significant volume spike at new highs in a confirmed early Supply Dominance monthly context, this could be a Blow-Off Top or high-level distribution. The wide spread on extreme volume suggests Smart Money is dumping into the strength created by the retail FOMO. Needs a sharp reversal to confirm distribution.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 53.99 (Last high), Support: 50.33 (Last low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on a close below 50.33. Long entry only if subsequent bar confirms break above 53.99 with low volume.
- **Invalidation:** New high above 54.00 invalidates short thesis temporarily.
---
### GLXY (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Climax Action/Supply Dominance Continuation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is a very wide spread DOWN bar on ultra-high volume (RelVol 2.01), closing mid-to-low range (CLV -0.45). This is classic high-volume, wide-spread selling, confirming Supply Dominance and continuation of the bearish quarterly trend. The massive volume indicates institutional liquidation or panic. Although the close is slightly off the low, the sheer magnitude of the spread and volume points to bearish exhaustion/capitulation, but until demand is confirmed, the trend remains down.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 27.91 (Last high), Support: 16.67 (Last low/Climax support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short continuation below 16.67, or wait for a No Demand Test after a small relief bounce.
- **Invalidation:** A strong recovery and close above 27.91.
---
### GWRE (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Climax Action/Supply Dominance Continuation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is a very wide spread DOWN bar on extremely high volume (RelVol 2.48), closing mid-to-low range (CLV -0.37). This is massive liquidation pressure confirming the deep bearish quarterly trend. The volume indicates a likely capitulation event (Selling Climax), but without immediate confirmation of a demand rebound, the immediate outlook is bearish continuation. The last two months show extreme bearish pressure.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 142.18 (Last high), Support: 121.88 (Last low/Climax support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short continuation below 121.88, or wait for a weak Test/No Demand bar to confirm a rally failure.
- **Invalidation:** A strong recovery and close above 142.18.
---
### HIMS (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Climax Action/Supply Dominance Continuation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is a wide spread DOWN bar on extreme volume (RelVol 2.01), closing mid-to-low range (CLV -0.42). This represents significant liquidation pressure, confirming the Supply Dominance in the bearish quarterly trend. While the high volume suggests capitulation, the size of the spread and the mid-low close mean supply remains dominant. Monthly chart echoes this extreme weakness.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 27.77 (Last high), Support: 21.12 (Last low/Climax support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry below 21.12. Wait for a rally failure (No Demand) for a higher probability short setup.
- **Invalidation:** A close above 27.77.
---
### HPQ (NEUTRAL/BULLISH Watch)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax Follow-through / Strength

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is a wide spread UP bar on very high volume (RelVol 2.10), closing mid-to-high (CLV 0.19). This high volume/wide spread is strong effort, but the close is modest (CLV 0.19), suggesting supply absorption near the top of the range. The quarterly trend is bearish, but the last bar successfully held above the key support zone (18.94 low from 01/26). This looks like institutional accumulation occurring on strength, challenging the bearish quarterly context.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 20.55 (Last high), Support: 18.32 (Last low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry above 20.55, confirming the clearance of the accumulation range. Short continuation below 18.32.
- **Invalidation:** A close below 18.32.
---
### HUM (NEUTRAL/BULLISH Watch)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Reaction

**Smart Money Logic:**
The prior week (01/26) was an extreme Supply Dominance event (wide spread down, ultra-high volume, CLV -0.90), a clear shakeout/climax. The most recent bar is a narrow spread UP bar on high volume (RelVol 1.53), closing mid-range (CLV 0.47). This volume suggests Smart Money entering, absorbing supply, and lifting the price off the lows. This action follows the climatic selling and indicates potential accumulation/reversal, though the quarterly trend remains bearish.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 196.75 (Last high), Support: 186.00 (Last low/Climax base)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A definitive No Supply Test on low volume near 188.00, or a clear break above 196.75 on strong volume.
- **Invalidation:** A close below 186.00.
---
### IAC (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Climax Action/Supply Dominance Continuation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is a wide spread DOWN bar on ultra-high volume (RelVol 1.98), closing mid-range (CLV -0.43). This massive volume signifies strong supply entering the market, confirming the bearish quarterly trend and weekly Supply Dominance signals. The price failed to recover meaningfully after the high volume sell-off from 01/26.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 39.04 (Last high), Support: 34.31 (Last low/Climax support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short continuation entry below 34.31, confirming breakdown. Wait for weakness (No Demand) on subsequent rallies.
- **Invalidation:** A close above 39.04.
---
### ICLR (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Climax Action/Supply Dominance Continuation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is an extremely wide spread DOWN bar on ultra-high volume (RelVol 1.89), closing near the low (CLV -0.65). This is overwhelming supply, confirming the bearish quarterly trend and the weekly Supply Dominance signal. This bar represents liquidation or panic selling (Selling Climax potential), but until a meaningful institutional reaction is seen, the momentum is aggressively down.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 180.51 (Last high), Support: 144.27 (Last low/Climax support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short continuation entry below 144.27, confirming breakdown. Wait for weakness (No Demand) on rallies.
- **Invalidation:** A close above 180.51.
---
### ILMN (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Climax Action/Supply Dominance Continuation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is a very wide spread DOWN bar on extremely high volume (RelVol 2.12), closing near the low (CLV -0.84). This is a strong Supply Dominance signal, confirming the continuation of the bearish quarterly trend. The massive volume indicates institutional liquidation or panic selling, driving the price lower efficiently.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 143.56 (Last high), Support: 117.67 (Last low/Climax support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short continuation entry below 117.67, confirming breakdown. Wait for weakness (No Demand) on rallies.
- **Invalidation:** A strong recovery and close above 143.56.
---
### ING (NEUTRAL/BEARISH Watch)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Effort No Result

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is a wide spread UP bar on ultra-high volume (RelVol 2.15), closing mid-range (CLV -0.28). This combination of massive effort (volume/spread) without a corresponding close near the high (poor CLV) suggests significant supply entering the market (Effort No Result). This is a potential Buying Climax signal, consistent with the weekly detection (WATCH_FOR_TEST). Smart Money may be distributing into this strength.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 31.18 (Last high/Climax high), Support: 29.44 (Last low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on a close below 29.44. Long entry requires a decisive close above 31.18.
- **Invalidation:** A close above 31.18 (invalidates short thesis).
---
### INVH (NEUTRAL/BULLISH Watch)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last bar is a narrow spread UP bar on high volume (RelVol 1.47), closing mid-range (CLV 0.13). The weekly and monthly sequences confirm early Stopping Volume. The high volume suggests continued supply being absorbed by Smart Money after the initial buying climax. The narrow range implies a fight between supply and demand near the support zone (25.57). We are watching for a successful Test (No Supply) to confirm the reversal.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 26.92 (Last high), Support: 25.58 (Last low/Stopping Volume base)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A successful Test (narrow spread, low volume bar) followed by strength, or a break above 27.65 (prior high).
- **Invalidation:** A close below 25.58.
---
### IONX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Climax Action/Supply Dominance Continuation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is a massive wide spread DOWN bar on extreme volume (RelVol 2.67), closing mid-range (CLV -0.25). This is indicative of huge, aggressive selling and panic (Selling Climax), confirming the deep Supply Dominance in the bearish quarterly trend. The volume is indicative of capitulation, but the immediate trend remains sharply down.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 16.64 (Last high), Support: 8.66 (Last low/Climax support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short continuation below 8.66. Look for a weak Test/No Demand bar for a short entry on a rally.
- **Invalidation:** A close above 16.64.
---
### IOT (NEUTRAL/BEARISH Watch)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Climax Reaction

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is a wide spread DOWN bar on ultra-high volume (RelVol 2.52), closing mid-range (CLV -0.09). This massive volume and wide spread strongly suggests a Selling Climax event, consistent with the weekly detection (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The market dipped heavily and managed to close well off the lows, indicating Smart Money stepped in to buy/absorb supply. Context is bearish quarterly, but this bar potentially marks a temporary bottom.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 27.91 (Last high), Support: 23.38 (Last low/Climax base)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Long entry requires a decisive No Supply Test on low volume near the 23.38 area. Short entry below 23.38.
- **Invalidation:** A close below 23.38 negates the climax reversal thesis.
---
### IQV (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Climax Action/Supply Dominance Continuation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is an extremely wide spread DOWN bar on ultra-high volume (RelVol 2.68), closing mid-range (CLV -0.60). This is a definitive sign of aggressive selling and institutional liquidation, consistent with the bearish quarterly trend. The volume spike and wide spread suggests either a major Selling Climax or massive distribution continuing the downtrend. The close is near the low, suggesting supply is still in control.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 233.48 (Last high), Support: 176.07 (Last low/Climax base)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short continuation below 176.07. Wait for a rally failure (No Demand) for an optimal short entry.
- **Invalidation:** A strong recovery and close above 233.48.
---
### IREN (BEARISH Watch)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax/Effort No Result

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is a very wide spread DOWN bar on extremely high volume (RelVol 1.78), closing mid-range (CLV -0.44). This comes after a massive uptrend and prior supply signs (01/26 wide spread down, CLV -0.66). This high volume selling suggests a major shift from accumulation to distribution/liquidation. The failure of price to hold previous gains on such volume confirms the Supply Dominance monthly context.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 55.72 (Last high), Support: 36.52 (Last low/Climax base)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on a close below 36.52. Look for an immediate, weak rally (No Demand) for optimal short entry.
- **Invalidation:** A quick recovery and close above 55.72.
---
### KKR (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Climax Action/Supply Dominance Continuation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is an extremely wide spread DOWN bar on massive volume (RelVol 3.27), closing mid-range (CLV -0.37). This is indicative of extreme institutional liquidation or panic selling (Selling Climax). The volume spike is enormous. While the close is off the lows, confirming some demand absorption, the overwhelming Supply Dominance preceding and during this bar dictates a bearish outlook until confirmed demand returns.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 116.08 (Last high), Support: 97.37 (Last low/Climax base)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short continuation below 97.37. Look for a weak Test/No Demand bar for optimal short entry.
- **Invalidation:** A close above 116.08.
---
### LHX (NEUTRAL/BEARISH Watch)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Effort No Result

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is a wide spread UP bar on high volume (RelVol 1.27), closing mid-to-high range (CLV 0.37). This follows a previous week of high volume/wide spread down (01/26, CLV -0.78), which suggested supply entering. The current bar shows strong effort to push price up, but the mid-range close suggests supply is still heavy at these high levels (potential Buying Climax continuation).

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 355.99 (Last high), Support: 335.63 (Last low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry if price fails to break 356.00 and subsequent bar shows high volume down/low close. Long entry requires a decisive break above 356.00.
- **Invalidation:** A close below 335.63.
---
### LTM (NEUTRAL/BEARISH Watch)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result (Potential Supply)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is a wide spread UP bar on extremely high volume (RelVol 1.93), closing mid-range (CLV -0.43). This is a strong Effort (high volume, wide spread) with a poor Result (close off the high/mid-range). This suggests institutional supply is meeting the rising demand, indicative of distribution at these high levels, despite the bullish quarterly trend. Smart Money may be initiating a short-term reversal.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 70.42 (Last high), Support: 62.62 (Last low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on a close below 62.62. Long entry requires sustained push above 70.42 with even higher volume.
- **Invalidation:** A close below 62.62.
---
### MCO (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Climax Action/Supply Dominance Continuation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is an extremely wide spread DOWN bar on massive volume (RelVol 2.91), closing near the low (CLV -0.75). This is overwhelming supply, confirming the bearish quarterly trend and weekly Supply Dominance signals. This is a potential Selling Climax, but the size of the drop and the high volume suggest institutional exit is dominant.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 521.27 (Last high), Support: 442.70 (Last low/Climax base)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short continuation below 442.70. Look for a weak Test/No Demand bar for optimal short entry on a relief rally.
- **Invalidation:** A strong recovery and close above 521.27.
---
### MNDY (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Climax Action/Supply Dominance Continuation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is an extremely wide spread DOWN bar on massive volume (RelVol 2.95), closing mid-range (CLV -0.57). This is definitive liquidation and panic selling (Selling Climax). The volume confirms institutional interest, but in the context of the strong bearish quarterly trend, this is currently a continuation of supply pressure. The close being slightly off the low suggests some buying, but the overall signal is aggressively bearish.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 117.25 (Last high), Support: 92.73 (Last low/Climax base)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short continuation below 92.73. Wait for a rally failure (No Demand) for an optimal short entry.
- **Invalidation:** A close above 117.25.
---
### MSFU (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Climax Action/Supply Dominance Continuation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is a wide spread DOWN bar on extremely high volume (RelVol 4.05), closing mid-range (CLV -0.59). This extreme volume marks major liquidation pressure, confirming the bearish quarterly and monthly Supply Dominance. This is a potential Selling Climax, but the immediate trend is dictated by the overwhelming supply.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 32.05 (Last high), Support: 26.50 (Last low/Climax base)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short continuation below 26.50. Wait for weakness (No Demand) on a relief rally.
- **Invalidation:** A close above 32.05.
---
### MTCH (NEUTRAL/BULLISH Watch)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Demand Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is a wide spread UP bar on high volume (RelVol 2.41), closing mid-to-high range (CLV 0.22). This high volume/wide spread is Effort, and the close suggests absorption of supply, potentially marking a Stopping Volume event after the sustained drop in the bearish quarterly trend. The volume surge indicates Smart Money participation, often preceding a reversal or accumulation phase.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 33.40 (Last high), Support: 28.81 (Last low/Stopping Volume base)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Look for a clear No Supply Test on low volume near 30.00. Long entry requires a decisive break above 33.40.
- **Invalidation:** A close below 28.81.
---
### NET (NEUTRAL/BULLISH Watch)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Absorption)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is a wide spread UP bar on ultra-high volume (RelVol 2.37), closing near mid-range (CLV 0.03). This massive volume following the prior week's Supply Dominance (01/26, RelVol 2.78) indicates Smart Money is absorbing heavy supply. The bar managed to push off the low, confirming the Stopping Volume setup. We are looking for confirmation of institutional accumulation in the bearish quarterly trend.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 185.22 (Last high), Support: 160.35 (Last low/Stopping Volume base)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A clear No Supply Test on low volume, or a break above 185.22.
- **Invalidation:** A close below 160.35.
---
### NFXL (NEUTRAL/BEARISH Watch)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Supply Absorption

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is a wide spread UP bar on high volume (RelVol 1.54), closing near mid-range (CLV -0.05). This action follows several weeks of sharp declines (bearish quarterly trend). The volume surge and push off the low (1.54 RelVol, closing near the middle of the spread) suggests potential stopping volume/supply absorption, although the close is weak. Smart Money is trying to halt the decline.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 24.97 (Last high), Support: 21.53 (Last low/Stopping Volume base)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A convincing No Supply Test on low volume, or a close above 24.97.
- **Invalidation:** A close below 21.53.
---
### NXPI (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Demand Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is a wide spread UP bar on extremely high volume (RelVol 2.19), closing mid-range (CLV 0.27). This wide range and high volume, following a sharp downtrend, suggests institutional buying (Stopping Volume). The close is significantly off the low, confirming the thesis that supply was absorbed effectively, suggesting an imminent mark-up phase in the bullish quarterly trend.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 234.09 (Last high), Support: 207.01 (Last low/Stopping Volume base)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A clean break and close above 234.09. Wait for a No Supply Test near 224.55 if price pulls back.
- **Invalidation:** A close below 207.01.
---
### NYT (NEUTRAL/BULLISH Watch)
**VSA Status:** Climax Action/Supply Absorption

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is an extremely wide spread DOWN bar on massive volume (RelVol 3.29), closing mid-range (CLV 0.21). This huge volume surge is indicative of a Selling Climax, absorbing massive supply. Crucially, the price closed well off the low and below the open, suggesting a sharp reversal intraday. This action arrests the bearish momentum in the quarterly trend.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 74.04 (Last high), Support: 58.87 (Last low/Climax base)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A clear No Supply Test on low volume near 68.11, or a strong push above 74.04.
- **Invalidation:** A close below 58.87.
---
### ORLY (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Test Pending)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar showed very high relative volume (2.05) and a wide spread, but closed mid-to-low (CLV -0.22), dropping from the high of 99.19 to close at 94.22. This suggests a significant influx of selling (or profit-taking) absorbing the demand, or Stopping Volume after a sharp decline within the weekly bar. Given the Quarterly BULLISH_TREND, this bar is likely institutional absorption/Stopping Volume, but requires a successful 'Test' to confirm commitment.

**Key Levels:** 99.23 (Recent High/Supply Zone), 91.09 (Stopping Volume Low), 94.70 (Previous close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Price holds above 91.09, followed by a low volume up-close bar (Test) or immediate rally above 95.00.
- **Invalidation:** 91.09 (If violated on volume)
---
### OTIS (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort to Rise (Follow-Through Needed)

**Smart Money Logic:**
OTIS showed SUPPLY_DOMINANCE previously (last two weeks had wide spreads and negative CLV). The most recent bar attempted a rally (High 92.05) on high volume (RelVol 2.01) but the closing price (89.84) was mid-range (CLV 0.35). This suggests significant effort to push price up, but also encountered supply near the highs (92.05). In a BULLISH_TREND context, this looks like absorption/accumulation, but the recent widespread selling (week 2026-01-26, CLV -0.62) needs to be overcome. Wait for clear strength.

**Key Levels:** 92.05 (Recent Supply), 85.28 (Recent Low Support), 90.98 (Previous Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Clear break and hold above 92.05.
- **Invalidation:** 85.28 (If broken, confirms supply dominance)
---
### PAGP (CAUTIOUS BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Potential Reversal)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar shows extremely high relative volume (2.29) and a wide spread, but the CLV is near the middle (0.06). Although the stock closed higher, the extreme volume suggests a massive influx of selling pressure meeting the demand near the top of the range (21.22). This volume is characteristic of a Buying Climax, especially after a run-up in a BULLISH_TREND. The Smart Money is likely distributing here.

**Key Levels:** 21.23 (Climax High/Supply), 20.12 (Low of Climax Bar), 19.78 (Key Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 20.12 confirming distribution.
- **Invalidation:** 21.23 (If price breaches the climax high, the move may continue)
---
### PEGA (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax/Effort No Result

**Smart Money Logic:**
PEGA is in a BEARISH_TREND and has seen extreme weakness, including an ultra-high volume week (RelVol 2.16) with a wide spread and a low CLV (-0.28). This suggests a potential Selling Climax, although the close was not entirely strong. The volume spike indicates massive selling/panic, but smart money may have stepped in near 37.54. The quarterly trend is bearish, so strength must be proven.

**Key Levels:** 44.73 (Immediate Supply), 37.54 (Climax Low Support), 47.27 (Prior Support turned Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Clear break above 44.73 on rising volume, confirming demand has returned.
- **Invalidation:** 37.54 (If broken, acceleration down expected)
---
### PGY (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax/No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stock is in a BEARISH_TREND. The last weekly bar saw extreme volume (RelVol 1.69) but a relatively narrow spread compared to the week before, closing near the low (CLV 0.05). This looks like a Selling Climax/Shakeout attempt, but the resultant low close indicates lack of immediate follow-through buying. The high volume suggests continued institutional selling, or a failed attempt by bulls to hold the price. Given the quarterly bearish context and recent heavy supply, further testing of lows is likely.

**Key Levels:** 20.52 (Immediate Resistance), 18.64 (Recent Close), 16.54 (Low of the move)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 16.54 for continuation of the markdown.
- **Invalidation:** 20.52 (If price rallies strongly and holds above this resistance)
---
### PLTR (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax/Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
PLTR is under heavy pressure (BEARISH_TREND). The last weekly bar saw immense volume (RelVol 2.20) and a wide spread, closing near the low (CLV -0.58). This is a textbook Selling Climax/Shakeout signaling panic selling. However, the close is still far from the absolute low (128.32), suggesting that smart money did not fully absorb the volume or distribution is continuing. The prior week (2026-01-26) was also heavy supply (CLV -0.88). Until a strong buying signal appears, supply remains dominant.

**Key Levels:** 165.07 (Supply Zone), 135.90 (Recent Close), 128.32 (Climax Low Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 128.32, confirming the climax failed to arrest the fall.
- **Invalidation:** 165.07 (Significant rally needed to negate bearishness)
---
### PLTU (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax/Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Similar to PLTR, this asset is experiencing significant markdown (BEARISH_TREND). The last weekly bar had extreme volume (RelVol 3.24) and a massive spread, closing in the lower half (CLV -0.64). This is a high-volume Selling Climax, indicating panic selling. The fact that price failed to close strong suggests continued institutional selling or lack of immediate aggressive buying from Smart Money. The path of least resistance remains down until tested.

**Key Levels:** 47.85 (Recent Support), 36.26 (Climax Low Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 36.26 to confirm continuation of the downtrend.
- **Invalidation:** 61.10 (Requires significant strength to negate)
---
### PPL (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Test Pending)

**Smart Money Logic:**
PPL showed a large volume spike (RelVol 2.14) but the spread was relatively narrow, closing mid-range (CLV 0.12). This occurred after three weeks of minor decline within a BULLISH_TREND. This high volume, coupled with a mid-to-high close, suggests that selling pressure was met by strong institutional buying (Stopping Volume). We need confirmation (a low volume test) or immediate follow-through strength.

**Key Levels:** 36.88 (Recent Resistance), 35.10 (Stopping Volume Low/Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and hold above 36.56, or a low volume pullback to 35.50.
- **Invalidation:** 35.10 (Violation of the Stopping Volume low)
---
### PRU (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax/Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
In a BEARISH_TREND, the last weekly bar exhibited ultra-high volume (RelVol 2.74) and a very wide spread, closing in the lower half (CLV -0.41). This confirms heavy institutional liquidation (Selling Climax/Shakeout). The close is not strong enough to declare absorption, suggesting supply remains in control. The prior week rallied hard (CLV 0.98), but this reversal bar effectively negated that strength.

**Key Levels:** 112.49 (Supply Zone), 98.80 (Climax Low Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 98.80, confirming the failure of the climax bar to hold.
- **Invalidation:** 112.49 (If bulls can reclaim prior week's high)
---
### PSN (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
After two weeks of decreasing volume and consolidation near the highs (72-74 area), the last week saw average volume (RelVol 0.87) with a narrow spread, closing mid-to-high (CLV 0.61). This small range move on below-average volume following a bearish effort (week 2026-01-26, CLV -0.57) suggests demand has stabilized the price temporarily. However, the quarterly trend is bullish, but the Monthly is flagging Supply Dominance. We need a clear signal, and this bar offers little conviction.

**Key Levels:** 73.26 (Immediate Resistance), 67.11 (Recent Low Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 73.26 on high volume for bullish continuation.
- **Invalidation:** 67.11 (If broken, tests the next accumulation area)
---
### PTC (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Test Pending)

**Smart Money Logic:**
PTC is in a BEARISH_TREND, but the last weekly bar showed very high volume (RelVol 2.50), a wide spread, and a strong mid-to-high close (CLV 0.41). This suggests strong institutional buying absorbing massive selling pressure (Stopping Volume) near 146.72. This is a potential bottom signal. Given the trend, a successful low-volume test of this zone would be highly constructive.

**Key Levels:** 159.46 (Immediate Supply), 146.72 (Stopping Volume Low Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Hold above 146.72 and subsequent rally above 159.46.
- **Invalidation:** 146.72 (Violation suggests climax failed)
---
### PTGX (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Effort to Rise (Follow-Through Needed)

**Smart Money Logic:**
PTGX is in a BEARISH_TREND but is currently undergoing accumulation/consolidation (Monthly BUYING_CLIMAX confirmed early). The last weekly bar saw slightly above-average volume (RelVol 1.04) and closed mid-range (CLV 0.45). This represents demand winning the week, but without decisive effort or a clear break of supply zones (86.09). Price is coiling, but lacks momentum confirmation for a reversal yet.

**Key Levels:** 86.09 (Supply/Resistance), 80.20 (Accumulation Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and hold above 86.10 on increased volume.
- **Invalidation:** 80.20 (If support is broken, price drops lower)
---
### PYPL (BEARISH (Extreme Weakness))
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax/Extreme Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
PYPL experienced catastrophic weakness. The last weekly bar displayed extreme volume (RelVol 3.72) and a massive spread, closing poorly near the low (CLV -0.78). This is an unmistakable Selling Climax, representing immense institutional liquidation and panic selling. The fact that the close is so weak indicates that even with this massive volume, the Smart Money has not fully stepped in to absorb the supply, or they are still selling. Confirmation of a bottom is far off.

**Key Levels:** 53.44 (Supply Zone), 38.88 (Climax Low Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Only consider shorts below 38.88. Longs require massive confirmation (e.g., a Test after holding 38.88).
- **Invalidation:** 38.88 (Extreme violation confirms continued markdown)
---
### QQQI (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Test Pending)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar, in a BULLISH_TREND, showed very high volume (RelVol 1.96) and a wide spread, but closed mid-to-low (CLV -0.03). This is classic Stopping Volume, with heavy selling being absorbed by strong demand near 51.83. The failure to close high signals supply interference or heavy profit-taking. A test of the low volume is needed to confirm absorption.

**Key Levels:** 54.35 (Supply Zone), 51.83 (Stopping Volume Low Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Low volume pullback (Test) to the 52.00 area, followed by a rally.
- **Invalidation:** 51.83 (If support is broken)
---
### RARE (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Supply Absorption/Neutral Close

**Smart Money Logic:**
RARE is flagged with Weekly SUPPLY_DOMINANCE and Monthly CONFIRMED_EARLY SUPPLY_DOMINANCE, but the last bar showed high volume (RelVol 1.44) and a wide spread, yet closed neutral (CLV 0.008). This is effort to rise met by supply, or a large shakeout at the low (23.55) that was absorbed. Given the confirmed supply context, this neutral close suggests the balance of power hasn't shifted clearly yet. Supply remains active near 25.82.

**Key Levels:** 25.82 (Supply Zone), 23.56 (Accumulation Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 25.82 with confirming volume.
- **Invalidation:** 23.56 (Break down confirms supply control)
---
### RGLD (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume/Supply Rejection

**Smart Money Logic:**
RGLD saw extreme distribution (week 2026-01-26, CLV -0.80) on high volume in a BULLISH_TREND. The last bar attempts a recovery on high volume (RelVol 1.28) but closes mid-range (CLV 0.11), suggesting the supply from the distribution bar is still heavy. This bar is likely Stopping Volume, preventing a collapse below 253.20, but the poor close means follow-through buying is absent. The Monthly context shows CONFIRMED_EARLY SUPPLY_DOMINANCE.

**Key Levels:** 275.66 (Supply Zone), 258.59 (Prior Distribution Low), 253.20 (Stopping Volume Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 275.66 for bullish recovery.
- **Invalidation:** 253.20 (Violation confirms markdown)
---
### RGTI (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume/Effort to Rise

**Smart Money Logic:**
RGTI is in a BEARISH_TREND and saw consecutive bearish weeks (CLV -0.49, -0.82). The last week showed high volume (RelVol 0.67) and a wide spread, closing mid-to-high (CLV 0.62). This suggests strong institutional buying absorbing the supply (Stopping Volume/Accumulation). Given the extreme weakness, this move is likely just short-covering/accumulation, but the close is constructive. Quarterly trend is bearish, requiring caution.

**Key Levels:** 18.38 (Immediate Resistance), 14.83 (Stopping Volume Low Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A low volume 'Test' of the 17.50-18.00 zone, or a breakout above 18.38.
- **Invalidation:** 14.83 (Violation signals failure)
---
### RKT (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance/Effort No Result

**Smart Money Logic:**
RKT is bearish (Monthly CONFIRMED_EARLY SUPPLY_DOMINANCE). The last weekly bar saw high volume (RelVol 1.24) and a wide spread, but closed poorly in the lower half (CLV -0.30). This is a clear sign that attempts to rally were met with heavy institutional supply near the 21.19 high. The buying effort resulted in failure, confirming supply is still pressing the price down.

**Key Levels:** 21.19 (Supply Zone), 17.66 (Recent Low Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 17.66, continuing the markdown.
- **Invalidation:** 21.19 (Rally above this would negate recent weakness)
---
### RTO (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume/Effort to Rise

**Smart Money Logic:**
RTO is in a BULLISH_TREND, but flagged BUYING_CLIMAX previously (high volume, mid-close on week 2026-01-26). The last bar continued the trend of ultra-high volume (RelVol 3.39), closing mid-range (CLV 0.20). This volume is characteristic of a large shakeout or institutional activity. The close is above the open, showing demand won the week, but the sheer volume without a strong close suggests strong opposition (supply) near the highs (32.68). Needs confirmation.

**Key Levels:** 33.46 (Climax High Resistance), 31.36 (Shakeout Low Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and hold above 32.70 on reduced volume (successful test) or increased volume (strength).
- **Invalidation:** 31.36 (Violation of the accumulation low)
---
### RVMD (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Supply/Demand Balance

**Smart Money Logic:**
RVMD has a Monthly BUYING_CLIMAX confirmed early, suggesting distribution at higher levels. The last weekly bar saw average volume (RelVol 0.93) and a wide spread, closing mid-range (CLV 0.36). This indicates equilibrium after recent volatility (Selling Climax on 2026-01-26). The current action suggests the market is pausing, digesting the large move, and establishing a trading range between 93.02 and 99.58.

**Key Levels:** 99.58 (Supply Zone), 93.02 (Accumulation Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Breakout above 99.58 or breakdown below 93.02.
- **Invalidation:** 93.02
---
### RYAAY (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance/Weak Effort

**Smart Money Logic:**
RYAAY is in a BEARISH_TREND and triggered Stopping Volume previously. The last bar had above-average volume (RelVol 1.34) and a wide spread, but closed poorly in the bottom half (CLV -0.48). This indicates that the volume that came in was dominated by supply, pushing the price down significantly from the weekly open (70.68). This is not a convincing stopping volume follow-through, and suggests weakness remains dominant.

**Key Levels:** 72.56 (Supply Zone), 67.24 (Recent Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 67.24, confirming markdown continuation.
- **Invalidation:** 72.56 (If price rallies strongly above this high)
---
### RYN (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
RYN is consolidating in a BULLISH_TREND but shows recent weakness. The previous week was Supply Dominance (RelVol 3.72, CLV -0.20). The last bar had high volume (RelVol 2.32) but a very narrow spread, closing near the low (CLV -0.60). This suggests supply is overwhelming any latent demand, confirmed by the narrow spread closing low on heavy volume. This indicates institutional selling pressure is increasing, despite the quarterly bullish context.

**Key Levels:** 22.98 (Immediate Resistance), 22.33 (Support), 21.90 (Prior Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 22.33 on increased volume.
- **Invalidation:** 23.50 (If price reclaims higher range)
---
### SARO (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Test Pending)

**Smart Money Logic:**
SARO is in a BULLISH_TREND but recently saw heavy distribution (RelVol 4.29, CLV -0.91). The latest bar had high volume (RelVol 2.07) and a wide spread, closing mid-to-high (CLV 0.51). This suggests institutional buying absorbed supply near 28.63 (Stopping Volume). The move requires confirmation, potentially via a low volume test of the demand zone.

**Key Levels:** 31.20 (Supply Zone), 28.63 (Stopping Volume Low Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Low volume pullback (Test) holding above 29.50, followed by a rally.
- **Invalidation:** 28.63 (If broken, distribution continues)
---
### SATS (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax/Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
SATS has a Monthly BUYING_CLIMAX warning. The last weekly bar saw high volume (RelVol 1.32) and a very wide spread, closing poorly in the lower half (CLV -0.38). This follows the high volume selling on the previous bar (CLV -0.67). This suggests institutional selling pressure remains dominant, despite the quarterly bullish context. The market attempted to rally to 122.98 but was rapidly rejected.

**Key Levels:** 122.99 (Supply Zone), 106.60 (Climax Low Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 106.60, confirming the downtrend continuation.
- **Invalidation:** 122.99 (If price breaks above the high of the supply bar)
---
### SONY (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume/Confirmed Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
SONY is in a BEARISH_TREND. The last weekly bar saw ultra-high volume (RelVol 2.71) and a wide spread, closing mid-to-high (CLV 0.30). This massive volume occurred after several weeks of continuous supply, suggesting institutional accumulation (Stopping Volume) near 21.18. The strong close indicates absorption, but further confirmation (like a Test or continuation) is needed given the bearish background.

**Key Levels:** 22.84 (Supply/Resistance), 21.18 (Stopping Volume Low Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and hold above 22.84, confirming strength.
- **Invalidation:** 21.18 (Violation of the low)
---
### SPOT (BEARISH (Extreme Weakness))
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax/Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
SPOT is in a major markdown phase (BEARISH_TREND). The last weekly bar displayed extreme volume (RelVol 2.98) and a huge spread (over $107), closing poorly in the bottom third (CLV -0.67). This is massive institutional liquidation (Selling Climax). The lack of a high close confirms that demand was utterly overwhelmed by supply. Avoid or look for short opportunities after temporary rallies.

**Key Levels:** 512.28 (Supply Zone), 405.00 (Climax Low Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 405.00 for continuation of the markdown.
- **Invalidation:** 512.28 (Requires massive recovery)
---
### SSNC (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax/Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
In a BEARISH_TREND, SSNC saw extreme volume (RelVol 3.45) and a very wide spread in the last week, closing mid-range (CLV 0.09). This is a Selling Climax/Shakeout bar, where panic selling was absorbed by institutional buying near the 70.89 low. The close being slightly positive, despite the massive range, indicates demand successfully defended the price low. This is a potential accumulation signal requiring a test.

**Key Levels:** 82.81 (Immediate Resistance), 70.89 (Climax Low Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Clear break above 82.81, or a successful low volume test of 70.89.
- **Invalidation:** 70.89 (Violation of the low confirms markdown continuation)
---
### STAA (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Confirmed Early)

**Smart Money Logic:**
STAA is in a BEARISH_TREND. The last weekly bar had high volume (RelVol 1.49) and a wide spread, closing mid-range (CLV -0.37). The weekly sequence is flagged as STOPPING_VOLUME (Confirmed Early). This suggests institutional buying near 16.94 absorbed significant supply. The close is slightly weak, meaning follow-through buying needs to materialize. Confirmation needed via a low volume test.

**Key Levels:** 19.00 (Immediate Resistance), 16.94 (Stopping Volume Low Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 19.00, or a low volume test holding 17.00.
- **Invalidation:** 16.94 (Violation invalidates accumulation thesis)
---
### SYF (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume/Confirmed Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
SYF is in a BEARISH_TREND. The last weekly bar had high volume (RelVol 1.31) and a wide spread, closing strongly near the high (CLV 0.62). This bar followed a supply week (CLV -0.72) and suggests demand successfully absorbed the selling pressure near 72.22. This is a potential Stopping Volume signal confirmed by the strong close, suggesting accumulation is underway.

**Key Levels:** 75.83 (Immediate Supply/Resistance), 72.22 (Stopping Volume Low Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and hold above 75.83 with confirming volume.
- **Invalidation:** 72.22 (Violation of the low)
---
### TROW (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax/Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
TROW is in a BEARISH_TREND. The last weekly bar saw very high volume (RelVol 2.46) and a wide spread, closing poorly near the low (CLV -0.62). This is a clear Selling Climax signal. However, the weak close indicates that demand was overwhelmed by institutional liquidation. Supply remains dominant, and the price is likely to be tested lower unless immediate strong demand appears.

**Key Levels:** 107.21 (Supply Zone), 91.70 (Climax Low Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 91.70, confirming the continuation of markdown.
- **Invalidation:** 107.21 (If price rallies above the high of the climax bar)
---
### TRU (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Test Pending)

**Smart Money Logic:**
TRU is in a BEARISH_TREND and has a confirmed Monthly STOPPING_VOLUME signal. The last weekly bar saw very high volume (RelVol 1.92) and a wide spread, closing mid-range (CLV 0.12). This represents strong institutional absorption of supply (Stopping Volume) near 65.23. The close is positive, but a test is usually required to confirm clearance of residual supply.

**Key Levels:** 79.90 (Immediate Supply), 65.24 (Stopping Volume Low Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Low volume Test holding 70.00, or a breakout above 79.90.
- **Invalidation:** 65.24 (Violation of the low)
---
### UBER (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax/Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
UBER is in a BEARISH_TREND. The last weekly bar saw massive volume (RelVol 2.10) and a wide spread, closing in the lower half (CLV -0.42). This signals a Selling Climax/Shakeout. However, the close is weak, suggesting demand did not fully absorb the massive supply that hit the market near 71.88. Supply remains in control, and the range needs to stabilize before a bullish thesis can be considered.

**Key Levels:** 81.89 (Supply Zone), 71.88 (Climax Low Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 71.88, confirming markdown continuation.
- **Invalidation:** 81.89 (Requires significant strength to break)
---
### UNH (BEARISH (Extreme Weakness))
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax/Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
UNH is in a BEARISH_TREND and saw a historic drop the week prior (CLV -0.82 on RelVol 2.97). The last bar, on high volume (RelVol 1.52), had a wide spread but closed poorly near the low (CLV -0.14). This indicates continued institutional selling pressure, or simply insufficient demand to absorb the climax volume. The close is near the open, showing weakness in demand follow-through after the massive drop.

**Key Levels:** 290.40 (Immediate Supply), 266.29 (Climax Low Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 266.29, confirming continuation.
- **Invalidation:** 290.40 (If price stabilizes and rallies past the high of the current bar)
---
### UNM (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Test Pending)

**Smart Money Logic:**
UNM is in a BEARISH_TREND. The last weekly bar saw high volume (RelVol 2.25) and a wide spread, closing mid-range (CLV 0.08). This is characteristic Stopping Volume, suggesting panic selling was absorbed near 69.93. The slightly positive close shows demand stabilizing the price. A successful low volume test in the subsequent weeks would confirm accumulation.

**Key Levels:** 78.42 (Supply/Resistance), 69.94 (Stopping Volume Low Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 78.42, confirming the strength.
- **Invalidation:** 69.94 (Violation of the low)
---
### VLTO (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax/Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
VLTO is in a BEARISH_TREND. The last weekly bar saw very high volume (RelVol 2.55) and a wide spread, closing poorly in the bottom third (CLV -0.66). This is a strong Selling Climax/Shakeout. However, the weak close suggests that institutional demand was not strong enough to absorb the volume, leaving supply in control. Further markdown is likely, unless proven otherwise.

**Key Levels:** 101.50 (Supply Zone), 88.40 (Climax Low Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 88.40, confirming continuation.
- **Invalidation:** 101.50 (Requires significant strength to negate bearishness)
---
### VONG (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance/Effort No Result

**Smart Money Logic:**
VONG (likely Growth ETF) is in a BEARISH_TREND. The last weekly bar saw high volume (RelVol 1.72) and a wide spread, but closed neutral/low (CLV -0.04). This suggests effort to rally was met by heavy supply, resulting in 'Effort No Result'. Despite the high volume, the neutral close confirms that institutional selling is still present at the high end of the range, preventing a meaningful recovery.

**Key Levels:** 120.78 (Immediate Supply), 114.49 (Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 114.49, confirming markdown.
- **Invalidation:** 120.78 (If price breaks the high of the supply bar)
---
### WGMI (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax/Effort No Result

**Smart Money Logic:**
WGMI is in a BULLISH_TREND, but recently saw heavy selling (CLV -0.82 on RelVol 1.15). The last bar saw high volume (RelVol 1.88) and a wide spread, but closed mid-to-low (CLV -0.06). This is a Selling Climax/Shakeout near 34.99, but the weak close indicates demand did not aggressively absorb the volume. This suggests the market is attempting to stabilize but supply is still active.

**Key Levels:** 46.62 (Supply Zone), 34.99 (Climax Low Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 46.62 or a successful low volume test of 35.00.
- **Invalidation:** 34.99 (Violation of the low)
---
### WMG (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume/Confirmed Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
WMG is in a BEARISH_TREND. The last bar saw extreme volume (RelVol 2.91) and a wide spread, closing mid-range (CLV 0.32). This is Stopping Volume, indicating significant institutional buying absorbed panic selling near 26.42. The close above the open confirms demand won the weekly battle. Given the bearish trend, a clear follow-through or test is required, but this is a constructive development.

**Key Levels:** 30.40 (Immediate Supply), 26.42 (Stopping Volume Low Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 30.40, or a low volume test holding above 29.00.
- **Invalidation:** 26.42 (Violation of the low)
---
### WPM (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume/Confirmed Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
WPM is in a BULLISH_TREND. Following a massive distribution/shakeout bar (CLV -0.89 on RelVol 1.92), the latest bar showed high volume (RelVol 1.62) and a wide spread, closing mid-range (CLV 0.12). This confirms institutional absorption of supply (Stopping Volume) near 129.12. The rally was strong, but the close being mid-range suggests residual supply needs clearance. This is a potential accumulation signal.

**Key Levels:** 141.30 (Immediate Supply), 129.12 (Stopping Volume Low Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and hold above 141.30, or a successful low volume test of the 130 area.
- **Invalidation:** 129.12 (Violation of the low)
---
### Z (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
The bar on 02-02 displayed extreme volume (2.57 RelVol) and a massive spread, closing near the low. This climactic action typically marks the exhaustion of the selling phase, where panic supply is absorbed by Smart Money. While the trend is bearish, a significant reaction rally or base building is now expected. Monitoring for a test of the low.

**Key Levels:** 53.61 (Climax Low), 63.00 (Breakdown Resistance), 70.48 (Prior High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Bullish reversal confirmation above 57.00 following a successful No Supply test of 53.61.
- **Invalidation:** 53.00
---
