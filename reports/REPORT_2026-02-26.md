## 🚀 Ready for Entry
### ACLX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result

**Smart Money Logic:**
Extreme volume spike (RelVol 8.60) with a very narrow price spread indicates massive supply hitting the market. Smart money is likely offloading shares into the rally, creating a classic buying climax/absorption ceiling.

**Key Levels:** 114.26, 64.11, 113.76

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 113.65
- **Invalidation:** 115.00
---
### ADSK (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
Large volume spikes on recent down moves followed by a week with very high CLV (0.81) and low RelVol suggests that professionals are beginning to absorb the selling pressure.

**Key Levels:** 215.01, 240.40, 224.81

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 225.80
- **Invalidation:** 215.01
---
### AIQ (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
Price is holding firm on low volume with a very high CLV (0.96). This suggests a successful test for supply in a bearish environment, potentially leading to a short-term bounce.

**Key Levels:** 48.27, 50.59, 50.55

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 50.60
- **Invalidation:** 48.34
---
### AMSC (BULLISH)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 35.81
- **Invalidation:** 32.01
---
### AXON (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 551.97
- **Invalidation:** 410.54
---
### FOXA (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
A massive increase in volume (RelVol 1.81) on a wide-spread down bar (Feb 9) with a CLV of -0.93 confirms distribution. The weak bounce on low volume suggests further downside.

**Key Levels:** 53.05, 57.02, 64.78

#### Action Plan

- **Invalidation:** 57.10
---
### GKOS (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
Monthly CLV is very high (0.90), showing strong support. While a buying climax is noted, the low volume on the final week's consolidation suggests a 'Test' rather than a reversal.

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 122.50
- **Invalidation:** 117.90
---
### GWRE (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort vs Result (Bullish)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 136.20
- **Invalidation:** 120.70
---
### HSBC (BULLISH)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Move above 94.80
- **Invalidation:** 86.69
---

- **Invalidation:** 25.30
---
### ITT (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Strength

**Key Levels:** 181.32, 208.86, 209.27

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 209.30
- **Invalidation:** 200.00
---
### LSCC (BULLISH)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 101.40
- **Invalidation:** 96.30
---
### MCO (BULLISH)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 466.00
- **Invalidation:** 436.29
---

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 78.40
- **Invalidation:** 73.72
---
### PHG (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Strength

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 31.65
- **Invalidation:** 30.77
---
### PPL (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Key Levels:** 38.28, 35.10, 38.45

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break of 38.50 with sustained volume
- **Invalidation:** 36.46
---
### PSN (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
Following a sharp drop on 2026-02-09, the spread has narrowed significantly on very low relative volume (0.63). This 'Test' suggests that the supply is exhausted, allowing for a potential move higher.

**Key Levels:** 65.18, 59.13, 70.60

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Price move above 65.65
- **Invalidation:** 63.81
---
### PTC (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
The heavy volume on 2026-02-02 and 2026-02-09 at lower levels resulted in price stabilization rather than a breakdown. The low volume on the last week's drop (RelVol 0.70) indicates supply is drying up.

**Key Levels:** 154.11, 146.72, 162.93

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Clearance of 156.00
- **Invalidation:** 148.44
---
### PTGX (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Absorption

**Smart Money Logic:**
Wide spread up-move on low relative volume (0.38) usually signals an easy move because there is no supply. The high CLV (0.60) shows bulls are in control despite low overall participation.

**Key Levels:** 87.10, 77.00, 89.59

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 89.60
- **Invalidation:** 80.40
---
### PYPL (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Sustained price above 48.50
- **Invalidation:** 40.52
---
### RGLD (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Absorption

**Smart Money Logic:**
After a massive supply bar on 2026-01-26, the price has recovered steadily on decreasing volume, which paradoxically shows a lack of selling pressure. The high CLV in mid-February confirms buyers.

**Key Levels:** 287.44, 253.20, 306.25

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Move above 294.50
- **Invalidation:** 281.10
---
### RGTI (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Test in a Rising Market

**Smart Money Logic:**
Volume has significantly decreased over the last four weeks while price consolidated. The high CLV (0.87) on the last week suggests smart money is absorbing the small amount of remaining supply.

**Key Levels:** 17.63, 14.78, 18.38

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break of 18.40
- **Invalidation:** 15.33
---
### RLI (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Test for Supply

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 62.00
- **Invalidation:** 59.88
---

- **Invalidation:** 35.01
---
### STM (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Absorption

**Smart Money Logic:**

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 35.10
- **Invalidation:** 33.45
---

- **Invalidation:** 70.65

- **Invalidation:** 111.00
---

### ABVX (BEARISH)

- **Invalidation:** 133.42

### ACM (BEARISH)

- **Invalidation:** 145.83
---
### ACWX (NEUTRAL)

- **Invalidation:** 73.43

### AMZN (BEARISH)

- **Invalidation:** 211.59

- **Invalidation:** 28.43

- **Entry Trigger:** N/A
- **Invalidation:** 312.58
---
### APH (BEARISH)

---
### APP (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Demand

- **Invalidation:** 435.00

- **Entry Trigger:** N/A
- **Invalidation:** 18.96
---
### ARE (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
Price is consolidating on extremely low relative volume (0.37). In a bullish context, this lack of supply at lows often leads to a continuation higher.

- **Invalidation:** 52.51

- **Invalidation:** 180.09
---
### AVAV (BEARISH)

---
### AVDL (NEUTRAL)

- **Invalidation:** 47.37

- **Invalidation:** 30.09

- **Invalidation:** 23.03

- **Invalidation:** 24.02
---
### BCE (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Price is falling with a very low CLV (-0.86) even on low volume. This lack of demand means any small amount of supply easily pushes price down.

- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 25.58
- **Invalidation:** 26.25
---
### FIGR (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
High relative volume (1.84) on large down-spreads with very low Close-to-Low Value (CLV) indicates aggressive professional selling. The minor rally on Feb 23 occurred on lower volume, suggesting a lack of institutional support.

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Breakdown below 28.30
- **Invalidation:** 35.30
---
### FISV (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Demand

- **Invalidation:** 63.70
---
### FTV (NEUTRAL)

- **Invalidation:** 56.50

- **Invalidation:** 50.92
---

- **Entry Trigger:** Volume spike above 10M
- **Invalidation:** 22.50
---
### HIMS (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Panic Selling / Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Enormous volume (RelVol 2.49) on Feb 9 drop confirms heavy distribution. Recent stability is low-quality as volume remains high but spreads are narrow, indicating heavy supply overhead.

- **Entry Trigger:** Breakdown below 13.70
- **Invalidation:** 16.50

- **Entry Trigger:** Volume-backed move above 21.50
- **Invalidation:** 19.80

### HPQ (BEARISH)

- **Invalidation:** 19.20
---
### HRMY (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
A massive volume spike (RelVol 2.35) on Feb 16 failed to produce a high CLV, meaning smart money was not fully absorbing the selling pressure yet.

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Breakdown below 25.90
- **Invalidation:** 29.35

### HUM (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Jan 26 crash on 3x normal volume (RelVol 3.14) suggests a climax. Since then, volatility has decreased, which usually precedes an accumulation phase.

- **Entry Trigger:** Successful test of 173.00 on low vol
- **Invalidation:** 169.00

### ICLR (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
RelVol of 6.7 on Feb 9 is an extreme institutional exit. Any bounce is likely short-covering rather than new investment.

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Failure to hold 99.50
- **Invalidation:** 106.90

**Smart Money Logic:**
Activity is very low. RelVol 0.52 suggests smart money is sitting on the sidelines. Expect sideways churn.

- **Entry Trigger:** RelVol > 1.5 with high CLV
- **Invalidation:** 34.50

### ING (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Supply was clearly present on the Feb 9 drop (RelVol 2.19). The subsequent bounce lacks the volume necessary to suggest a trend reversal.

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Breakdown below 28.60
- **Invalidation:** 30.10
---
### INVH (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
Consistent RelVol above 1.0 on down moves indicates supply, but the very low volume on the final week (0.66) suggests selling pressure is exhausted for now.

- **Invalidation:** 25.20

- **Invalidation:** 34.30

### IONX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

- **Invalidation:** 11.27

- **Invalidation:** 47.25

### KLAR (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Panic Selling / Supply Dominance

- **Invalidation:** 16.40
---

### KYMR (BULLISH)

- **Invalidation:** 85.70

- **Invalidation:** 17.56
---
### MNDY (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

- **Invalidation:** 76.42

- **Invalidation:** 24.90

- **Invalidation:** 29.55

### OC (BEARISH)

- **Entry Trigger:** Breakdown below 24.00
- **Invalidation:** 25.30

- **Invalidation:** 21.57

- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 46.00
- **Invalidation:** 41.41
---
### PGY (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Significant selling volume in Feb. The tiny price movement on high CLV in the last week looks like professional short-covering rather than long accumulation.

**Key Levels:** 10.51, 11.85, 20.52

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Breakdown below 10.50
- **Invalidation:** 12.73
---
### PLTR (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
Massive supply entered on 2026-02-02 with very high relative volume (1.96). The subsequent bounce has occurred on significantly diminishing volume (RelVol 0.67), suggesting smart money is not supporting the move higher.

### PLTU (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Demand

- **Invalidation:** 18.04
---
### RTO (BEARISH)

### RYN (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

- **Invalidation:** 22.65

- **Entry Trigger:** Break of 32.20
- **Invalidation:** 30.42

### SATS (BEARISH)

### SPOT (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

### SSNC (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Selling volume on 2026-02-02 and 2026-02-09 was extreme. The recent bounce on lower volume with a strong CLV may be a trap as it has not cleared the breakdown bar's high.

- **Invalidation:** 95.76

- **Invalidation:** 291.77
---
### VLTO (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
