## 🚀 Ready for Entry
### CNQ (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
Weekly charts show classic Stopping Volume on 2026-01-05 (Very High Volume, wide spread down, closing near mid-range, CLV 0.35). This suggests Smart Money entered to absorb supply. The two subsequent weeks tested the supply/demand balance. The last week (2026-01-19) closed strong (CLV 0.38) on average volume, indicating absorption completed above the low of the stopping volume bar. Quarterly trend is bullish, supporting continuation after a brief weekly correction/accumulation.

**Key Levels:** Support: 30.13 (Stopping Volume Low), Resistance: 36.11 (Recent High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 35.50 (Last week's close/minor resistance) with confirming volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 31.90 (Below stopping volume midpoint/recent consolidation).
---
### CNXC (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stopping volume occurred on 2026-01-12 (Very High Volume, wide spread down, closing near the high, CLV 0.76). This aggressive bar followed an up-wave (2026-01-05), indicating a successful shakeout or absorption of supply. The last week (2026-01-19) was a positive reaction, closing strong (CLV 0.76) on below-average volume (No Supply sign developing), confirming the absorption effort.

**Key Levels:** Support: 37.85 (Stopping Volume Low), Resistance: 44.78 (Recent High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 44.02 (Last week's high) confirming the immediate up move.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 40.56 (Below midpoint of Stopping Volume bar).
---
### CPNG (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly and weekly sequences confirm Supply Dominance. The last two weeks (01/12 and 01/19) showed extreme bearish behavior. 01/12 had Very High Volume and a wide spread down, closing near the low (CLV -0.61). 01/19 followed through with a smaller spread, still closing near the low (CLV -0.88), on below-average volume, signaling persistent weakness and likely No Demand on the reaction. Bears are firmly in control in a Quarterly Bearish context.

**Key Levels:** Support: 19.87 (Recent Low), Resistance: 22.87 (Immediate Supply Zone)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 19.87 on confirming volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 21.14 (Above last week's high, suggesting demand is stabilizing).
---
### CTRA (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Successful Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
The 01/12 bar was high volume on a wide spread, closing low (CLV -0.45), tagged as Buying Climax. However, the last week (01/19) showed a strong recovery, closing near the high (CLV 0.82) on average volume (suggesting successful absorption/test of demand). The overall Quarterly trend is BULLISH, lending credibility to the recent move as a shakeout/climax absorption rather than a reversal.

**Key Levels:** Support: 25.70 (Immediate Support), Resistance: 28.48 (Climax High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and sustain above 27.40.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 24.68 (Below the low of the climax bar).
---
### FIBK (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Pullback

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is bullish, supported by strong momentum leading into January. The monthly chart flagged a Buying Climax, often a sign of exhaustion. However, the last week (01/19) was a strong up bar (CLV 0.60) on slightly reduced volume, pushing towards the high. The previous week (01/12) was a high volume Test/Pullback (CLV 0.10). The strength suggests the market makers are actively marking up the price, potentially ignoring the minor monthly climax signal for now.

**Key Levels:** Support: 35.95 (Immediate Support), Resistance: 38.78 (Recent High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close above 38.78.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 36.80 (Previous week's close).
---
### FISV (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Demand Return

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is Bullish. The 01/12 bar showed significant supply (Extreme Volume, wide spread down, CLV -0.82), a potential Upthrust or Shakeout. However, the next bar (01/19) aggressively rejected that weakness, closing near the high (CLV 0.91) on average volume, demonstrating strong immediate demand absorbing the previous supply. This bullish reaction suggests continuation of the primary trend.

**Key Levels:** Support: 65.97 (Low of Shakeout), Resistance: 70.41 (Recent High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 67.55 (Last week's high) with volume confirmation.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 65.97.
---
### FRPT (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is bullish. Monthly confirmation of Stopping Volume (CLV 0.96) is strong. The last weekly bar (01/19) was highly bullish (Extreme Spread UP, closed near high, CLV 0.94) on high volume, completing the signal setup. This is a clear sign of institutional buying and markup phase initiation.

**Key Levels:** Support: 63.48 (Immediate Support), Resistance: 72.85 (Recent High/Target)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry on minor pullback or consolidation near 72.00.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 64.00 (Below the prior strong support level).
---
### GBCI (BULLISH (VSA Conflict Override))
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Upward Momentum

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly flag for Supply Dominance is potentially being overridden by strong weekly action in the Bullish Quarterly trend. The last three weeks show strong upward momentum and strong closes (CLV 0.49, 0.30, 0.54), particularly the last week which pushed near all-time highs on strong spread and average volume. Supply (indicated by the Monthly signal) is currently not appearing effective at stopping this markup.

**Key Levels:** Support: 47.86 (Immediate Support), Resistance: 50.87 (Recent High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and sustain above 50.87.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 46.50 (Last week's low).
---
### GKOS (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Continuation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly flagged a CONFIRMED_EARLY Buying Climax, suggesting a potential high. However, the weekly price action is overpowering this. The 01/12 bar was a massive range up (Spread 27.67) on high volume, closing near the high (CLV 0.89). The subsequent week (01/19) continued higher, confirming the strength (CLV 0.27) on lower volume. This suggests a strong markup phase where demand is overpowering any distribution efforts. The high volume move suggests institutionally backed strength.

**Key Levels:** Support: 118.25 (Immediate Support), Resistance: 130.23 (Recent High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 130.23 on confirming volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 120.24 (Previous week's close).
---
### GWRE (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Continued Weakness

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is bearish, confirmed by persistent weekly supply. The 01/05 bar had high volume and closed near the low (CLV -0.0008), indicating supply dominance. The 01/12 bar was exceptionally bearish (Extreme Volume, massive spread down, CLV -0.98), confirming institutional selling. The last week (01/19) continued lower, closing poorly (CLV -0.25) on relatively high volume (1.36 RelVol). The markdown phase is clearly active.

**Key Levels:** Support: 154.51 (Recent Low/Target), Resistance: 185.07 (Immediate Supply)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 154.51 on confirming volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 160.77 (Immediate reversal sign).
---
### HDB (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Weak Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is bearish. The weekly sequence confirms Supply Dominance. The 01/05 bar was a clear sign of weakness (Extreme Volume, wide spread down, CLV -0.90). The follow-up weeks failed to show sustained recovery. The last week (01/19) was a tight down bar closing near the low (CLV -0.25) on average volume (0.98 RelVol). This suggests demand is weak and further markdown is likely.

**Key Levels:** Support: 31.77 (Recent Low), Resistance: 33.60 (Immediate Supply)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 31.77 on confirming volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 33.09 (Above the recovery high).
---
### IOT (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Confirmed Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is bearish, supported by monthly Buying Climax flag (often meaning exhaustion followed by supply). The 01/12 bar had very high volume and closed well (CLV 0.37), but the subsequent bar (01/19) was a decisive push down, closing near the low (CLV -0.35) on lower volume. This suggests the high volume demand effort was rejected, and supply is returning. The bearish trend is likely to continue.

**Key Levels:** Support: 31.25 (Recent Low), Resistance: 34.89 (Immediate Supply)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 31.25 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 33.82 (Last week's high).
---
### JPM (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Confirmed Weakness

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is bearish, confirmed by the weekly Supply Dominance signals. The 01/12 bar was Extreme Volume on a wide spread down, closing near the low (CLV -0.38), confirming weakness. The last week (01/19) continued the markdown, closing poorly (CLV -0.50) on low volume (No Demand follow-through), indicating professional selling is active. The stock is likely entering a markdown phase.

**Key Levels:** Support: 301.15 (Recent Low/Target), Resistance: 312.47 (Immediate Supply)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 301.15 on confirming volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 311.15.
---
### KEY (BULLISH (VSA Conflict Override))
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Markup Strength

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is Bullish, but the Monthly confirmed Supply Dominance. The last week (01/19) saw a significant push up (wide spread, CLV 0.47) on volume that suggests demand is overcoming the signaled supply. The range expansion upwards indicates a strong markup attempt, potentially invalidating the earlier Monthly Supply signal.

**Key Levels:** Support: 20.97 (Immediate Support), Resistance: 22.06 (Recent High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 22.06 with volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 21.17 (Previous week's close).
---
### KVYO (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Spring Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
Monthly and Weekly charts flagged Stopping Volume, supported by the bullish Quarterly trend. The 01/12 bar was a major shakeout/climax (High Volume, wide spread down, CLV -0.96). The last bar (01/19) aggressively reversed this, closing at the absolute high of the week (CLV 0.97) on lower volume (signaling a Spring/No Supply Test success). This VSA signature is extremely bullish.

**Key Levels:** Support: 23.00 (Spring/Shakeout Low), Resistance: 28.65 (Immediate Supply)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry on minor pullback or consolidation near 26.44.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 23.74 (Below last week's open).
---
### KYMR (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Reversal Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is bullish. The Monthly flagged a Buying Climax, typically indicating a pause/reversal. However, the last week (01/19) was an aggressive reversal up from the prior weakness (01/12 CLV -0.96), closing near the high (CLV 0.97) on average volume. This strong bullish rejection suggests the recent dip was a shakeout, and demand is strongly returning to resume the markup phase.

**Key Levels:** Support: 66.20 (Immediate Low), Resistance: 77.92 (Recent High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 74.77 (Previous week's close) with volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 69.54 (Below prior low close).
---
### LHX (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Thrust Continuation

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is bullish. The 01/12 bar was a strong Buying Climax bar (Extreme Volume, wide spread, but closing low, CLV -0.05). This suggests heavy selling into strength. However, the next week (01/19) showed overwhelming demand, closing near the high (CLV 0.92) on higher volume (0.94 RelVol). This suggests the climax was successfully absorbed by powerful demand, and the markup is resuming.

**Key Levels:** Support: 346.46 (Immediate Support), Resistance: 361.59 (Recent High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and sustain above 361.59.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 340.28 (Last week's low).
---
### LQDA (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Demand Return

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is bullish, supporting the recent price action despite the Monthly Supply Dominance flag. The 01/12 bar was a strong shakeout (High Volume, wide spread, CLV -0.01) potentially absorbing supply. The final bar (01/19) was a strong up bar (CLV 0.41) on lower volume, confirming demand is currently in control and pushing price towards the highs. The bearish monthly signal appears contained.

**Key Levels:** Support: 37.67 (Immediate Support), Resistance: 42.46 (Recent High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and sustain above 42.46.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 37.93 (Below prior week's close).
---
### MAN (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Markup Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is bullish, despite the Monthly CONFIRMED_EARLY Supply Dominance. The last week (01/19) saw a strong reaction upward, closing near the high (CLV 0.85) on below-average volume. This suggests the prior weakness (01/12 CLV -0.39) was successfully tested and absorbed. Demand is currently pushing the price higher, overriding the bearish monthly signal.

**Key Levels:** Support: 30.07 (Immediate Support), Resistance: 31.75 (Recent High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 31.75 with volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 29.83 (Previous consolidation support).
---
### MOD (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Spring Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
Weekly flagged Stopping Volume, despite the Bearish Quarterly trend. The 01/05 bar was extreme volume down (CLV -0.20), suggesting climax selling. The subsequent week (01/12) was a high volume recovery (CLV 0.70). The last bar (01/19) confirmed the demand return, closing near the high (CLV 0.64) on lower volume. This aggressive rejection of lower prices suggests a major Spring/Accumulation effort is underway.

**Key Levels:** Support: 122.21 (Immediate Support), Resistance: 150.75 (Recent High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry on minor pullback or break above 147.52.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 132.80 (Last week's low).
---
### NFXL (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Confirmed Markdown

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is bearish, and weekly charts confirm aggressive Supply Dominance. The last three bars show sustained weakness, culminating in the 01/19 bar: wide spread down, closing near the low (CLV -0.59) on extremely high volume (2.87 RelVol). This indicates panic selling and institutional distribution, confirming the markdown phase is accelerating.

**Key Levels:** Support: 23.15 (Recent Low/Target), Resistance: 27.96 (Immediate Supply)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 23.15 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 27.00.
---
### OC (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Markup Continuation

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is bullish, supported by the Monthly CONFIRMED_EARLY Stopping Volume signal (CLV 0.81). The last three weeks have shown increasingly strong bullish action, culminating in the 01/19 bar which closed high (CLV 0.56) on lower volume (No Supply). This confirms the markup phase is active and supply absorption is complete.

**Key Levels:** Support: 124.56 (Immediate Support), Resistance: 126.87 (Recent High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and sustain above 126.87.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 120.39 (Below prior low of consolidation).
---
### OKLO (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Selling Follow-through

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is bearish, supported by the Monthly CONFIRMED_EARLY Buying Climax. The 01/05 bar was an extreme high volume spike (CLV 0.41), quickly followed by two weeks of significant selling pressure. The 01/12 bar showed weakness (CLV -0.38). The 01/19 bar closed poorly (CLV -0.30) on average volume. The selling reaction after the high volume spike suggests a major institutional exit/distribution at the highs, leading to markdown continuation.

**Key Levels:** Support: 86.02 (Immediate Low), Resistance: 107.60 (Immediate Supply)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 86.02 on confirming volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 95.00.
---
### ONB (BULLISH (VSA Conflict Override))
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Markup

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is bullish. Despite the Monthly CONFIRMED_STRONG Supply Dominance, the last weekly bar (01/19) showed strong markup (wide spread, CLV 0.43) on slightly below-average volume. This strength, closing near recent highs, suggests that professional demand is overcoming prior supply signals. The trend is moving up, indicating strength in the face of previous distribution attempts.

**Key Levels:** Support: 23.26 (Immediate Support), Resistance: 24.77 (Recent High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 24.77 with confirming volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 23.00.
---
### PSN (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Markup Continuation

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is bearish, but the Monthly CONFIRMED_EARLY Supply Dominance seems to have completed a shakeout/test. The 01/05 and 01/12 bars were strong up bars (CLV 0.97 and 0.82 respectively) on high volume. The last week (01/19) was a tight range up, closing neutrally (CLV 0.05) on lower volume. While the last bar is not overwhelmingly bullish, the aggressive markup in the preceding two weeks suggests demand has taken control and is likely pushing higher.

**Key Levels:** Support: 70.74 (Immediate Support), Resistance: 73.81 (Recent High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and sustain above 73.81.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 71.85 (Last week's open).

### QTWO (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Spring Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is bearish, but the Monthly CONFIRMED_EARLY Supply Dominance appears to have marked the low (01/12). The 01/12 bar was high volume, wide spread down, closing near the low (CLV -0.92), a classic shakeout. The last bar (01/19) aggressively reversed this, closing near the high (CLV 0.98) on lower volume. This looks like a Spring or reversal signal, indicating strong institutional entry at the lows.

**Key Levels:** Support: 63.44 (Spring Low), Resistance: 70.24 (Immediate Supply)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry on minor pullback or break above 68.52.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 64.88 (Failure to hold the consolidation above the Spring).
---
### RF (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Markup Continuation

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is bullish, contradicting the Monthly Supply Dominance flag. The 01/12 bar was a wide spread down, closing low (CLV -0.32) on high volume. This weakness was immediately absorbed and reversed by the 01/19 bar, which closed higher (CLV 0.19) on lower volume. This is indicative of a successful Test of Supply/Shakeout, paving the way for continuation of the markup in line with the primary bullish trend.

**Key Levels:** Support: 27.25 (Immediate Low), Resistance: 28.98 (Recent High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 28.98 with confirming volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 27.77 (Previous week's close).
---
### RGLD (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort to Rise (Confirmed)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly chart shows strong upward effort (January) with wide spread and above-average volume (RelVol 1.05), closing near the high (CLV 0.88). This confirms the continuation of the BULLISH_TREND from the Quarterly context. The last weekly bar is a very wide spread up close, closing near the high (CLV 0.67) on high volume (RelVol 0.70, but average relative to the high-volume weeks 3 and 4). This suggests strong buying interest (Effort to Rise). The previous two weeks saw significant effort (high volume, wide spread up) which was absorbed, suggesting Smart Money participation.

**Key Levels:** Support: 245.20 (Last month high), 224.00 (January Open), Resistance: 292.10 (Recent High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 292.10 on increasing volume, or a shallow dip/test towards 280.00.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 245.00 (break of recent pivot/support).
---
### RLI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Down Bar

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly context is BEARISH. The Monthly sequence showed a BUYING_CLIMAX (Watch for Test), suggesting the minor rally was met with distribution. The January monthly bar is a wide spread down bar, closing very low (CLV -0.63) on above-average volume (RelVol 1.14), confirming strong distribution and downward momentum. The last weekly bar is a wide spread down bar, closing in the lower third (CLV -0.36) on above-average volume (RelVol 1.06). This consistent downside progress with volume indicates that supply is in full control and the markdown phase is continuing.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 60.52 (Last weekly high), Immediate Support: 55.80 (Recent Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 55.80 on high volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 60.52 (indicating immediate supply failure).
---
### SA (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort to Rise / Strong Follow Through

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly context is BULLISH, though the Monthly sequence showed recent SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (now transitioning). The January monthly bar shows a huge upward spread closing very high (CLV 0.93) on average volume (RelVol 1.01). This is a strong sign of institutional demand overcoming prior supply. The last weekly bar is extremely bullish: wide spread up, closing near the high (CLV 0.89) on average volume (RelVol 0.76). This demonstrates strong upward momentum and decisive buying after a short period of consolidation (Weeks 3 & 4), which showed poor closing on down moves, indicating absorption.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 37.22 (Recent High), Immediate Support: 32.00 (Breakout area)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 37.22 on increased volume, or entry on a shallow pullback to 36.00.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 31.75 (low of the breakout week).
---
### SARO (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Confirmed)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly context is BULLISH, but this asset is showing immediate signs of distribution. The VSA Expert detected SUPPLY_DOMINANCE on the last weekly bar (Week 5). This bar opened high but saw a massive reversal: wide spread down, closing in the lower third (CLV -0.30) on ULTRA-HIGH volume (RelVol 3.38). This is textbook selling pressure, indicating Smart Money unloading shares aggressively into the rally. The monthly bar shows a moderate close (CLV 0.27) on ultra-high volume, confirming that January's rally was met with significant resistance and distribution near the highs (34.47).

**Key Levels:** Major Supply/Resistance: 34.48, Immediate Support: 31.22 (Last weekly low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on break below 31.22, confirming the weekly reversal.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 34.48 (invalidating the distribution bar).
---
### SPOT (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Confirmed)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly context is BEARISH. The Monthly chart shows continuous weakness, with the January bar being a wide spread down, closing very low (CLV -0.87) on average volume (RelVol 0.91). This confirms the markdown phase is active. The last three weekly bars are highly bearish. Week 3 was ultra-wide spread down, closing near the low (CLV -0.91) on ultra-high volume (RelVol 1.53). Week 4 was also wide spread down, closing near the low (CLV -0.84) on high volume (RelVol 1.94). Week 5 was a wide spread down bar, closing low (CLV -0.38) on high volume (RelVol 1.00). This overwhelming volume and downside pressure confirms SUPPLY_DOMINANCE and institutional selling.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 515.00 (Last weekly high), Immediate Support: 491.30 (Recent Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 491.30 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 539.37 (indicating a significant reversal of short-term selling).
---
### STAA (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume Test Failure

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly context is BEARISH. The VSA Expert detected STOPPING_VOLUME confirmed early in Week 4, but this was followed by a weak close in Week 5. The monthly chart shows continuous severe weakness (CLV -0.79 in January) on high volume. Week 4 was a wide spread down bar, closing poorly (CLV -0.04) on high volume (RelVol 1.54), initially suggesting possible stopping volume/effort, but lacking a strong close. Week 5 is a wide spread down bar, closing very low (CLV -0.68) on average volume (RelVol 0.75). The close below the low of the potential Stopping Volume bar (Week 4 low of 19.39) indicates the supply remains dominant, and the potential reversal failed.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 21.27 (Last weekly high), Immediate Support: 19.40 (Previous low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 19.40 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 21.30 (indicating successful absorption).
---
### TFX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Confirmed)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly context is BEARISH. The VSA Expert detected SUPPLY_DOMINANCE confirmed early (Weeks 3 & 4). January Monthly bar is wide spread down, closing very low (CLV -0.64) on high volume (RelVol 1.14), confirming the markdown. Week 4 was a huge spread down bar, closing near the low (CLV -0.93) on high volume (RelVol 1.61), confirming heavy supply. Week 5 is an up bar, but on average volume (RelVol 0.83) and closing only moderately high (CLV 0.42). This suggests a weak pullback following massive selling pressure, likely a minor retest of supply. The short-term trend is clearly down with dominant supply.

**Key Levels:** Resistance/Supply: 107.06 (Last weekly high), Support: 100.18 (Recent Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on break below 103.00 (Week 4 close), or failure to hold 107.06.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 108.40 (breaking above the reaction high).
---
### TRU (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort to Rise (Successful Follow Through)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly context is BULLISH. The Monthly sequence showed STOPPING_VOLUME confirmed strong (indicating institutional accumulation). The January monthly bar is wide spread up, closing moderately high (CLV 0.17) on lower volume (RelVol 0.68), suggesting relative lack of selling pressure after the Stopping Volume event. The last three weekly bars are highly constructive: Weeks 3, 4, and 5 all closed strongly in the upper third (CLV 0.64, 0.66, 0.75) despite varied spreads. This indicates consistent demand pushing price higher and overcoming minor resistance. The low volume in Week 5 (RelVol 0.48) with a strong close confirms ease of movement up.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 89.12 (Recent High), Immediate Support: 84.19 (Last weekly open)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 89.12 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 83.18 (low of the accumulation range).
---
### USIG (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply / Absorption

**Smart Money Logic:**
This is a low volatility, tight-range asset in a BULLISH_TREND. The VSA Expert detected SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (Watch for Test) in the last weekly sequence. However, analyzing the recent volume spikes (Weeks 3 & 4) which showed massive volume but very tight spread, this suggests heavy institutional absorption near the top of the range (around 51.98). Week 5 is a narrow spread up bar, closing very high (CLV 0.82) on lower volume (RelVol 0.73). This shows supply has dried up and the market is moving up easily, confirming the absorption phase and a successful No Supply test within the tight range structure.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Resistance: 52.12 (Recent High), Support/Demand: 51.65

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 52.12 on increased volume, confirming mark up out of the accumulation range.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 51.65 (indicating the support level failed).
---
### VONG (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply (Failed Test/Accumulation)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly context is BEARISH, but the Monthly sequence shows STOPPING_VOLUME (Watch for Test), suggesting accumulation is occurring in this lower range. Week 4 saw ultra-high volume (RelVol 2.51) on a wide spread down bar, closing poorly (CLV -0.32). This is either deep supply or massive Stopping Volume. Week 5 is a tight spread up bar, closing very high (CLV 0.76) on below-average volume (RelVol 1.02, but low compared to the prior spike). The strong close on lower volume suggests supply dried up after the heavy absorption/shakeout in Week 4. This pattern suggests a successful spring/shakeout and a No Supply confirmation.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 121.73 (Last swing high), Accumulation Low: 117.63 (Week 5 low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 121.73 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 117.63 (invalidating the accumulation phase).
---
### WRB (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Confirmed)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly context is BEARISH, and the Monthly sequence is SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (Watch for Test). The last three monthly bars are down bars, with January closing very low (CLV -0.55) on lower volume, indicating ease of movement down. Weeks 3 and 4 were wide spread down bars closing low (CLVs -0.73 and -0.71 respectively), confirming heavy selling pressure. Week 5 is a narrow spread up bar, closing in the middle (CLV 0.12) on low volume (RelVol 0.51). This low volume up move indicates a lack of interest and weakness in demand, setting up a potential low volume test of supply before the markdown continues.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 68.32 (Last weekly high), Support: 66.50 (Recent Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on break below 66.50 on increased volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 69.36 (breaking above the consolidation range).
---
## 👀 Watch/Monitoring
### CORT (NEUTRAL/BULLISH (Aggressive))
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Upthrust Reaction

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stock is in a Quarterly BEARISH trend but flashed massive Stopping Volume on 2025-12-29 (Extreme Volume, CLV -0.79, indicating supply shock). This was followed by a subsequent high volume reaction bar (2026-01-19) closing strong (CLV 0.54), indicating strong demand returning, overcoming the previous down-close from 01/12. The monthly chart also showed Supply Dominance, making this Stopping Volume potentially very significant for a reversal, provided the low holds.

**Key Levels:** Support: 32.99 (Stopping Volume Low/Absolute Low), Resistance: 43.50 (Recent Reaction High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 43.50 with sustained volume, confirming strength out of the base.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 34.27 (Below 01/05 low, indicating failure of the accumulation area).
---
### CRBG (NEUTRAL/BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax Follow-through (Absorption)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly chart indicates a Buying Climax, typically signaling an end to the immediate uptrend or accumulation. However, the last two weekly bars show tight ranges and positive CLVs (0.08 and 0.76) on reducing volume, particularly the last week which saw strong closing despite the overall bearish Quarterly trend. This suggests absorption or re-accumulation after the initial buying climax spike (01/05). The inability of supply to push prices significantly lower on relatively high prior volume (01/12) is constructive.

**Key Levels:** Support: 29.35 (Low of recent consolidation), Resistance: 31.50 (Recent High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close above 31.50 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 29.35 (Signaling a strong break of the current range).
---
### CSGP (NEUTRAL/BULLISH (Aggressive Countertrend))
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Rejection of Low

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is bearish, but a strong reaction occurred. The 01/05 bar showed massive supply (Extreme Volume, wide spread down, CLV -0.98), confirming Supply Dominance. However, the next week (01/12) had similar Extreme Volume but a massive spread up, closing near the high (CLV 0.86), showing aggressive absorption. The follow-up week (01/19) saw a strong close (CLV 0.38) on lower volume. This rapid reversal suggests institutional absorption/Spring in progress against the bear trend.

**Key Levels:** Support: 57.01 (Low of Absorption Bar), Resistance: 67.79 (Immediate Supply)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 67.80 with confirming volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 62.81 (Failure of the immediate absorption rally).
---
### DOW (NEUTRAL/BEARISH (VSA Conflict))
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Weak Follow-through

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart shows CONFIRMED_EARLY Supply Dominance, contrasting with the BULLISH Quarterly trend. The last three weeks show strong upward movement (01/05 and 01/12 were strong up bars), but the last week (01/19) saw a wide spread up on low relative volume (CLV 0.45). This suggests Effort without clear Result or potentially a minor Upthrust/Weakness in the final push. Need to monitor if the Monthly Supply Dominance signals materialize or if the bullish trend overrides.

**Key Levels:** Support: 26.07 (Minor Support), Resistance: 29.09 (Recent High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 27.50 on increased volume.
- **Invalidation:** New high close above 29.09.
---
### DUOL (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Reversal Attempt / Downward Bias

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is bearish. The monthly context is Supply Dominance. The 01/12 week was a significant bearish bar (Very High Volume, wide spread, CLV -0.78), confirming strong selling pressure. The last week (01/19) attempted a bounce on lower volume, closing moderately high (CLV 0.56), but this looks like a weak Test in a strong downward environment. The bearish context remains dominant.

**Key Levels:** Support: 142.10 (Recent Low), Resistance: 157.00 (Immediate Supply)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 147.70 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 157.00 (Suggesting reversal attempt is gaining traction).
---
### ENR (NEUTRAL/BEARISH (VSA Conflict))
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Weakness

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is bullish, but the Monthly confirms Supply Dominance. The last two weekly bars show increasing weakness. The 01/12 bar was a wide spread down, closing near the low (CLV -0.70) on high volume. The 01/19 bar was a tight range, closing in the middle (CLV 0.34) on significantly lower volume. This suggests weakness followed by No Demand, likely indicating the Monthly Supply Dominance is taking hold.

**Key Levels:** Support: 18.92 (01/05 low), Resistance: 21.90 (Recent High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 20.20 on increased selling volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 21.00.
---
### FER (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Weakness

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is bullish, but the Monthly is flagged for Supply Dominance. The 01/12 week was a strong up bar on high volume (CLV 0.65). However, the last week (01/19) reversed this, closing lower (CLV 0.60) on significantly below-average volume. This lack of follow-through strength on low volume suggests professional interest is waning at these highs, confirming the potential distribution indicated by the Monthly context.

**Key Levels:** Support: 65.55 (Last week low), Resistance: 68.54 (Recent High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 66.61 (Previous week's open/low of consolidation).
- **Invalidation:** New high close above 68.54.
---
### FFIV (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume Test / Neutral Consolidation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart shows Stopping Volume (CLV -0.41), suggesting accumulation is in progress within the overall bullish quarterly trend. Weekly action shows consolidation after a minor shakeout (01/12 had high volume, wide spread, closing low, CLV -0.54). The last week (01/19) was a down bar, closing low (CLV -0.35), on lower volume, suggesting supply is still present but fading. Currently consolidating near the low of the range; waiting for a clear sign of demand return.

**Key Levels:** Support: 259.44 (Immediate Low), Resistance: 267.40 (Immediate Supply)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Clear break above 267.40 with strong volume, or a successful low volume Test near support.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 254.21 (Monthly low).
---
### GNTX (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Neutral Close

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is bullish, but the Monthly is flagged for Supply Dominance. The last two weeks saw higher volume (01/12), followed by average volume (01/19), both closing neutrally (CLV -0.01 and 0.01). This tightness at the top of the recent range following high volume suggests potential stalling and absorption/distribution. The market is waiting for a decisive push.

**Key Levels:** Support: 23.34 (Immediate Low), Resistance: 24.79 (Recent High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 24.80 or break below 23.30.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 24.80 (For short setup) or close below 23.34 (For long setup).
---
### HPE (NEUTRAL/BULLISH (Aggressive))
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Upthrust

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is bearish, but the Monthly confirms Stopping Volume (CLV -0.40), suggesting accumulation. The 01/12 bar was a strong down push (CLV -0.96) on high volume. The last week (01/19) reacted strongly, closing mid-to-high range (CLV 0.38) on lower volume. This suggests the market makers supported the price and absorbed supply, indicating a potential Spring/Shakeout completion despite the bearish quarterly context.

**Key Levels:** Support: 20.08 (Stopping Volume Low), Resistance: 22.71 (Immediate Supply)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 21.94 (Last week's high) with volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 20.70 (Below last week's open/minor support).
---
### HRMY (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Failed Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is bullish, but the Monthly is flagged for Supply Dominance. The 01/12 bar showed major weakness (High Volume, wide spread down, CLV -0.34). The last week (01/19) attempted a recovery, closing mid-range (CLV 0.55) on extremely low volume (0.49 RelVol). This lack of commitment suggests demand is not yet ready to overcome the recent supply influx, pointing to a neutral consolidation pending a stronger demand signal.

**Key Levels:** Support: 34.68 (Low of prior week), Resistance: 37.21 (Immediate Supply)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 38.55 (01/05 close) on confirming volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 35.16.
---
### IMAX (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Upthrust

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is bearish, but the Monthly is flagged for Stopping Volume. The 01/12 bar was a high volume spike up, closing near the high (CLV 0.90). This initial strength was immediately rejected by the 01/19 bar, which closed near the low (CLV -0.92) on low volume. This is a classic Upthrust action following potential Stopping Volume, suggesting a failure to hold the markup and increased vulnerability to markdown continuation.

**Key Levels:** Support: 33.00 (Recent Low), Resistance: 37.86 (Immediate Supply)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 35.30 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 37.86.
---
### INVH (NEUTRAL/BEARISH (Weakness in follow-up))
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume Confirmation / Failed Reaction

**Smart Money Logic:**
Weekly confirmed Stopping Volume on 01/05 (Extreme Volume, wide spread down, CLV -0.20), suggesting Smart Money accumulation in a bearish quarterly trend. The next week (01/12) was a very strong bullish reaction (CLV 0.98). However, the last bar (01/19) showed immediate weakness, closing near the low (CLV -0.84) on low volume. This lack of demand follow-through after the initial rally suggests the accumulation base needs more time, or the supply pressure is overwhelming the initial demand effort.

**Key Levels:** Support: 26.95 (Immediate Support), Resistance: 27.78 (Recent High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a clean break above 27.80 with volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 26.50 (Below the up-close of the 01/05 bar).
---
### IONQ (NEUTRAL/BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Selling Reaction

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is Bullish, but the Monthly confirms a Buying Climax. The 01/19 bar was a wide spread, high volume down bar (CLV -0.14), rejecting the high of the week. This looks like a selling wave following an attempt at markup (01/12). The prior extreme volume bar (12/22, CLV -0.95) was highly bearish. The market is showing significant instability, suggesting distribution at the top of the range.

**Key Levels:** Support: 45.69 (Recent Low), Resistance: 54.24 (Recent High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 48.60 (Below recent opens/consolidation area).
- **Invalidation:** New high close above 54.24.
---
### IREN (NEUTRAL/BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Selling into Strength

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is bullish, but the Monthly is flagged for Supply Dominance. The 01/12 bar was a strong markup (Extreme Volume, wide spread, CLV 0.85). This strength was immediately countered by the 01/19 bar, which was a wide down bar, closing poorly (CLV -0.22) on high volume (0.74 RelVol). This looks like selling occurred into the buying climax/markup bar, suggesting potential distribution at the top of the range.

**Key Levels:** Support: 48.83 (Immediate Support), Resistance: 58.75 (Recent High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 48.83 on confirming volume.
- **Invalidation:** New high close above 57.82.
---
### ITT (NEUTRAL/BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Markup Effort

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is Bullish, conflicting with the Monthly Supply Dominance flag. Weekly action shows volatility. The 01/05 bar was a strong up bar on high volume (CLV 0.70). The last bar (01/19) was also a strong up bar (CLV 0.25) on below-average volume. The general action suggests the bullish trend is fighting off the monthly supply pressure. The close near the high indicates demand is present, but follow-through volume is lacking.

**Key Levels:** Support: 180.48 (Immediate Support), Resistance: 187.65 (Recent High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 187.65 with increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 180.29 (Below prior week's low).
---
### KDP (NEUTRAL/BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Failed Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is bearish, conflicting with the Monthly Buying Climax flag. Weekly price action shows consolidation and lack of sustained demand. The last two weeks saw supply dominate the closes (CLV -0.82 and -0.09) on similar, tight ranges. The last bar (01/19) had low volume and closed poorly, suggesting No Demand. The bearish quarterly trend is asserting itself against minor buying attempts.

**Key Levels:** Support: 27.08 (Recent Low), Resistance: 28.36 (Recent High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 27.08 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 27.86 (Prior consolidation high).
---
### MSFU (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Lack of Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is bearish, confirmed by the Monthly Supply Dominance flag. The 01/12 bar was a clear markdown (High Volume, wide spread down, CLV -0.72). The last week (01/19) saw a modest reaction up, but the close was still poor (CLV 0.35) and volume was still high (1.39 RelVol). The high volume reaction suggests continued selling into the attempted bounce, indicating significant supply pressure.

**Key Levels:** Support: 33.85 (Recent Low), Resistance: 37.25 (Immediate Supply)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 33.85 on confirming volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 36.74.
---
### NICE (NEUTRAL/BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Weak Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is bullish, but the Monthly is flagged for Supply Dominance. The 01/12 bar was a wide spread down, closing low (CLV -0.36) on high volume, suggesting a shakeout or distribution. The follow-up bar (01/19) was a neutral close (CLV -0.05) on lower volume, signaling No Demand or a poor Test. This consolidation below the recent high indicates potential distribution at the current levels, challenging the primary bullish trend.

**Key Levels:** Support: 109.30 (Recent Low), Resistance: 115.45 (Immediate Supply)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 109.30 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 118.37 (Prior high).
---
### PGY (NEUTRAL/BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Weak Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is bearish, supported by the Monthly Supply Dominance flag. The 01/12 bar was a decisive down bar, closing near the low (CLV -0.93) on high volume, confirming supply. The final bar (01/19) was a weak recovery attempt, closing mid-range (CLV 0.41) on lower volume. This suggests a weak Test for supply after aggressive selling, indicating vulnerability to further markdown.

**Key Levels:** Support: 20.62 (Recent Low), Resistance: 22.68 (Immediate Supply)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 20.62 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 22.68.

### PTGX (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Neutral Consolidation

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is bearish, conflicting with the Monthly Buying Climax flag. Weekly action shows consolidation after a sharp break down (01/05 CLV -0.75). The subsequent two weeks are range-bound with neutral/positive closes (CLV -0.25 and 0.84) on low volume. This suggests the high volume supply shock has paused, and the market is testing the area. The strong close on 01/19 (CLV 0.84) indicates some demand return, but the overall bearish context necessitates caution.

**Key Levels:** Support: 79.87 (Immediate Low), Resistance: 85.20 (Immediate Supply)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 85.20 with volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 79.87.

### QQQI (NEUTRAL/BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Neutral Consolidation

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is bullish, supported by the overall low volatility nature of the ETF. The Monthly flagged a Buying Climax, suggesting a pause. The weekly action shows very tight consolidation on average volume. The last bar (01/19) had a strong close (CLV 0.62) on slightly below-average volume. This suggests quiet demand accumulation within a tight range, preparing for continuation of the markup in line with the Quarterly trend.

**Key Levels:** Support: 53.26 (Immediate Support), Resistance: 54.19 (Recent High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 54.19 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 52.78.

### RARE (NEUTRAL/BULLISH (Countertrend))
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Accumulation Attempt

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is bearish, confirmed by Weekly CONFIRMED_EARLY Supply Dominance. The massive supply bar on 12/29 (Extreme Volume, CLV 0.85 - likely due to a major news event or institutional dumping followed by absorption) set the base. The subsequent two weeks tested this low (01/12 CLV -0.91), and the final bar (01/19) was an aggressive recovery (CLV 0.49) on low volume. This suggests accumulation is occurring in this low range, potentially preparing for a countertrend rally.

**Key Levels:** Support: 22.00 (Immediate Low), Resistance: 24.65 (Immediate Supply)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 24.65 with volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 22.00.

### RGTI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Effort No Result (Down Bar)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly context is BEARISH. The Monthly sequence showed a BUYING_CLIMAX confirmed early (indicating heavy distribution). The January monthly bar is wide spread up, but with average relative volume (0.42) and a CLV of 0.31, suggesting the move up lacked committed institutional follow-through relative to the selling pressure seen previously. The last weekly bar is a wide spread up bar, closing in the middle (CLV 0.24) on low/average volume (RelVol 0.40). Given the monthly Buying Climax context, this weakness in the recent rally (lack of high CLV/effort) suggests supply is maintaining control. Price struggled severely after the massive volume spikes in previous months (Nov/Dec).

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 26.70 (Recent Weekly High), Supply Zone: 24.96 - 26.70, Support: 21.53 (Previous Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 23.50 (low of recent range) signaling renewed weakness.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 26.70 (indicating sustained absorption of supply).

### RKT (NEUTRAL/BEARISH WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result (Down Bar)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly context is BULLISH, but the Monthly sequence is SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (Watch for Test). The January monthly bar was a wide spread up, but closed poorly (CLV -0.12) on very high relative volume (1.61), indicating significant supply coming in, absorbing the effort (Upthrust/Effort No Result on monthly). The last two weekly bars confirm this. Week 4 was a wide spread down bar, closing low (CLV -0.15) on high volume (RelVol 1.01). Week 5 was a wide spread down bar, closing low (CLV -0.33) on average volume (RelVol 0.48). This continuous dropping CLV on down bars signals Smart Money is distributing heavily near the recent high of 24.36.

**Key Levels:** Resistance/Supply: 24.36 (Recent High), Support: 20.91 (Last weekly low), 19.89 (Previous major weekly support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on break below 20.90, or long entry after a successful No Supply test of 19.89.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 23.50 (re-entry into the high range).

### RTO (NEUTRAL/PULLBACK EXPECTED)
**VSA Status:** Effort to Rise (Buying Climax)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly context is BULLISH. The last two weekly bars show excessive effort. Week 4 was high volume (RelVol 1.91) with a wide spread up, but poor close (CLV 0.16). Week 5 was ultra-high volume (RelVol 2.08) with a wide spread up, closing very high (CLV 0.92). The VSA Expert detected STOPPING_VOLUME on Week 4, followed by a massive surge on Week 5. This ultra-high volume surge into 32.84, immediately following the earlier detection, suggests a final push or Buying Climax. The monthly bar closed extremely high (CLV 0.95) on above-average volume (RelVol 1.15). We must now WATCH_FOR_TEST of this high demand level. The high volume without an equal increase in weekly spread suggests increased friction near the highs.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 32.84 (Recent High), Immediate Demand/Test Zone: 31.50 - 30.76

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short-term bearish trigger on break below 32.00. Long entry on a shallow No Supply test near 30.76.
- **Invalidation:** Sustained close below 30.00.

### SYF (NEUTRAL/BULLISH WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Test in Progress)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly context is BULLISH. The VSA Expert detected STOPPING_VOLUME confirmed early in Week 4. Week 4 was an ultra-wide spread down bar, closing well off the lows (CLV 0.52) on ULTRA-HIGH volume (RelVol 1.85). This is classic institutional absorption/Stopping Volume in a potential accumulation phase. Week 5 is a narrower spread down bar, closing higher (CLV 0.31) on much lower volume (RelVol 0.77). This low volume selling after Stopping Volume suggests successful absorption of supply, potentially signaling a No Supply Test. The Monthly bar closed poorly (CLV -0.54) but the presence of clear Stopping Volume at the low of the range is a strong technical signal.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Support: 75.37 (Low of Test Bar), Demand Zone: 75.00 - 77.73

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry on the first up bar following a successful Test (i.e., a tight spread bar closing high on low volume near 78.00).
- **Invalidation:** Close below 74.95 (break of Stopping Volume low).

### WGMI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Follow-Through Failure)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly context is BULLISH, but the Monthly sequence showed a BUYING_CLIMAX confirmed early. The January monthly bar is a wide spread up, but closed poorly (CLV 0.26) on average volume. Week 4 was a wide spread up, closing very high (CLV 0.80) on high volume (RelVol 0.82), indicating strong initial effort. However, Week 5 is a wide spread down bar, closing low (CLV -0.37) on lower volume (RelVol 0.70). This reversal, especially after hitting the high of 51.78, suggests the bullish effort (Week 4) was met by immediate institutional selling/distribution, leading to an Effort No Result or Upthrust like action.

**Key Levels:** Major Supply/Resistance: 51.78 (Recent High), Immediate Support: 45.11 (Last weekly low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on a break below 45.11.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 51.78 (indicating supply completely cleared).
