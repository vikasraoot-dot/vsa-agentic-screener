## 🚀 Ready for Entry
### ABVX (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
After a monthly supply surge, the weekly volume has dried up while price holds the upper end of the range. The low volume suggests a lack of active selling pressure.

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 130.50 on high relative volume
- **Invalidation:** 123.00
---
### ADSK (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
Professional money appears to be absorbing selling pressure near the lows. The high CLV (0.92) on low volume last week suggests sellers are exhausted.

**Key Levels:** 231.22, 221.09, 216.01

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 232.00 on rising volume
- **Invalidation:** 216.00

- **Invalidation:** 26.50

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break of 82.50
- **Invalidation:** 79.00
---
### AMSC (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Test of Supply

Large volume spike followed by a high-close (Feb 09). Last week's test on low volume suggests supply has been absorbed.

- **Invalidation:** 32.00

### ASML (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 1477.00
- **Invalidation:** 1380.00
---
### AXTA (BULLISH)

- **Invalidation:** 34.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 53.20
- **Invalidation:** 51.00

### BCE (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
Previous supply dominance was countered by a massive volume spike on 2026-02-02 which likely represented absorption. The most recent bar shows a very narrow spread on significantly lower volume (RelVol 0.27), indicating that selling pressure has been exhausted.

**Key Levels:** 25.00, 26.50

- **Invalidation:** 24.90
---
### CCI (BULLISH)

- **Invalidation:** 23.20

---

## 👀 Watch/Monitoring
### ABT (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Demand

**Key Levels:** 113.76, 105.27, 110.83

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 111.60 with increasing volume
- **Invalidation:** 114.50
---
### ACLX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
Narrowing spreads and very low volume (RelVol 0.37) following a period of supply dominance indicates the current upward move lacks institutional backing.

**Key Levels:** 71.23, 66.12, 79.75

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Failure to hold 68.00
- **Invalidation:** 71.50
---
### ACM (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Test of Supply

The massive supply bar on Feb 09 (RelVol 2.54) has not been neutralized. The current bounce on low volume is merely a test of that heavy supply zone.

**Key Levels:** 109.00, 87.56, 95.43

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Bearish engulfing on daily timeframe below 95.00
- **Invalidation:** 101.50
---
### ACWI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
High volume was observed on the Feb 09 drop. The subsequent drift higher on lower volume suggests professional money is not following through on the long side.

**Key Levels:** 148.41, 144.39, 142.92

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Drop below 145.00
- **Invalidation:** 148.50
---

- **Entry Trigger:** Break of 72.30 support
- **Invalidation:** 74.10
---
### ADP (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Demand

Heavy distribution occurred between Feb 02 and Feb 09. Last week's rally on low volume (RelVol 0.72) is a weak attempt to recover that is likely to fail.

**Key Levels:** 231.36, 210.22, 208.62

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 215.00
- **Invalidation:** 232.00

### AEHR (BEARISH)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Daily close below 28.00
- **Invalidation:** 31.00

### AEVA (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Demand

- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 12.50
- **Invalidation:** 13.50

- **Entry Trigger:** Break of 49.00
- **Invalidation:** 53.00

- **Invalidation:** 135.00

- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 16.30
- **Invalidation:** 17.50

- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 30.00
- **Invalidation:** 31.50
---
### AMZN (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**

- **Invalidation:** 210.00

- **Invalidation:** 28.50

### AON (NEUTRAL)

- **Invalidation:** 22.50

- **Invalidation:** 127.00

- **Invalidation:** 19.00

- **Invalidation:** 136.00
---
### ARMK (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

- **Invalidation:** 41.00
---

- **Invalidation:** 66.00

- **Invalidation:** 39.00

### ATO (BEARISH)

- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 177.50

- **Invalidation:** 21.50

- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 426.00
- **Invalidation:** 445.00

- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 23.00
- **Invalidation:** 25.00

- **Invalidation:** 213.00

- **Invalidation:** 40.50

- **Entry Trigger:** Drop below 76.00
- **Invalidation:** 80.00

- **Entry Trigger:** Close below 19.80
- **Invalidation:** 20.40
---
### BBT (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

- **Entry Trigger:** Violation of 30.20
- **Invalidation:** 31.20
---
### BBVA (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Demand

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break of 22.80
- **Invalidation:** 24.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Drop below 23.60
- **Invalidation:** 24.50
---
### BE (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
After a high-volume sell-off, the most recent week shows a strong recovery with a high CLV (0.91) on lower volume. This suggests smart money absorbed the panic and is now supporting the price.

**Key Levels:** 131.00, 158.50

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** High volume breakout above 160.00
- **Invalidation:** 131.00
---
### BEP (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
Price is reaching new highs but on diminishing volume and narrowing spreads. The last bar shows a negative CLV on very low relative volume, suggesting professionals are not participating in this move higher.

**Key Levels:** 30.00, 32.80

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a successful low volume test of 30.00
- **Invalidation:** 29.30
---
### BFAM (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result (Bearish)

**Smart Money Logic:**
A massive volume spike on the 2026-02-09 sell-off indicates heavy distribution. While the last week saw a bounce, the overall quarterly context is bearish and the selling effort vastly outweighs the recovery volume.

**Key Levels:** 63.60, 71.00, 85.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Failure to hold 71.00
- **Invalidation:** 72.50
---
### BHP (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
Large volume spikes on up-bars followed by narrowing spreads and lower volume moves higher suggest that demand is exhausting. Smart money is likely offloading into the retail strength.

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 71.80
- **Invalidation:** 75.60
---
### BKKT (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stock is in a clear downtrend following a monthly buying climax. Last week showed almost zero interest from buyers (RelVol 0.18), indicating the path of least resistance remains down.

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short on rally failure at 11.50
- **Invalidation:** 13.50
---
### BKSY (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Overcoming Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
Despite narrow spreads, the inability to bounce following the volume spike in early February suggests supply is consistently meeting every buy order. Relative volume is very low, showing no institutional support.

**Key Levels:** 19.00, 22.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 20.50
- **Invalidation:** 23.20
---
### BL (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result (Bearish)

- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 36.20
- **Invalidation:** 40.00
---
### BRBR (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Early)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Extreme volume on the 2026-02-02 sell-off suggests a potential capitulation. Last week saw price stabilize on lower volume, but the trend remains heavily bearish until a successful test is seen.

**Key Levels:** 17.00, 19.50

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Low volume test of 17.50 following a higher high
- **Invalidation:** 17.00
---
### BRO (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
Significant supply hit the market on 2026-02-09. The current week's bounce is on much lower volume and narrow spread, a classic sign of 'No Demand' after professional selling.

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 68.30
- **Invalidation:** 70.50
---
### BROS (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
High volume selling in late January has not been met with any supportive volume. Last week's narrow spread suggests exhaustion, but the prevailing trend and high volume distribution peaks are bearish.

**Key Levels:** 50.00, 54.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 50.60
- **Invalidation:** 56.00
---
### BRZE (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** High volume breakout above 18.50
- **Invalidation:** 16.20
---
### BSX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Bag Holding / Panic Selling

**Smart Money Logic:**
Massive relative volume (3.4x) on a huge down bar in early February indicates institutional distribution. The current sideways move on low volume indicates no professional interest in higher prices.

**Key Levels:** 72.70, 76.80

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Failure at 76.50
- **Invalidation:** 77.50
---
### BSY (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
After a buying climax, the stock is trying to bounce on very low volume. The high CLV on the last bar is deceptive because it lacks the volume 'effort' to sustain a reversal.

**Key Levels:** 30.90, 34.30

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 32.80
- **Invalidation:** 34.50
---
### BWA (BEARISH)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 61.20
- **Invalidation:** 65.00
---
### BWIN (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Consistently high volume on down moves with narrowing spreads on bounces. The monthly trend is dominated by supply, and last week's low volume bounce suggests no buyers.

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 16.20
- **Invalidation:** 18.00
---
### BX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
High volume selling in early February was a major distribution event. The recent low volume rally is a typical 'No Demand' signal after supply has entered the market.

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 126.60
- **Invalidation:** 136.00
---
### BXP (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
Selling pressure expanded on 2026-02-09 but was met with some absorption. Last week's narrow spread and average CLV suggest the market is searching for equilibrium.

**Key Levels:** 57.60, 62.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Test of 58.00 on low volume
- **Invalidation:** 57.50
---
### BXSL (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** No Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
Very low relative volume and narrowing spreads suggest that neither side is aggressive. The stopping volume from earlier in the month is holding, but demand is absent.

**Key Levels:** 24.00, 25.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** High volume break of 25.00
- **Invalidation:** 24.00
---
### CADE (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
A massive volume spike on a down move (RelVol 4.79) indicates a major institutional exit. The low volume follow-through confirms that the smart money is not buying this dip.

**Key Levels:** 41.50, 43.50

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 41.50
- **Invalidation:** 44.00
---
### CALX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result (Bearish)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Large volume was required to stabilize the price after the buying climax. The recovery is occurring on diminishing volume, suggesting the move is corrective rather than impulsive.

**Key Levels:** 44.20, 53.60

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Failure at 54.00
- **Invalidation:** 57.50
---
### CBRE (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
The massive sell-off on 2026-02-09 was met by some stopping volume. However, the bounce is occurring on much lower volume, suggesting supply is still lingering overhead.

**Key Levels:** 125.70, 153.10

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 138.30
- **Invalidation:** 154.00
---
### CBRL (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
Price is oscillating on very low volume. After the monthly supply dominance, the current lack of activity suggests the stock is in a drift phase with no smart money commitment.

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** High volume breakout above 34.50
- **Invalidation:** 30.50
---
### CBSH (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stock is slowly sagging on very low relative volume. Without a high-volume 'Shakeout' or 'Stopping Volume' bar, the price is likely to continue drifting lower.

**Key Levels:** 52.30, 54.60

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 52.80
- **Invalidation:** 54.70
---
### CCOI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
Price continues to make new highs but spreads are narrowing and volume is consistently below average. This indicates that professional interest is fading at these levels.

**Key Levels:** 25.70, 28.70

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 26.60
- **Invalidation:** 28.80
---
### CDE (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
High volume selling in late January marked a climax. The recent bounce has seen volume drop by 75%, confirming a lack of professional demand behind the recovery.

**Key Levels:** 19.00, 23.70

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 20.50
- **Invalidation:** 23.80
---
### CIVI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
Very high volume on the 2026-01-26 up-move resulted in a poor close (low CLV), indicating hidden supply or professional distribution into retail buying.

- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 26.60
- **Invalidation:** 29.50
---

- **Invalidation:** 24.80

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 39.10
- **Invalidation:** 42.50
---
### CPNG (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Consistent selling on high volume. The small recovery last week was on significantly lower volume (RelVol 0.68), suggesting it is merely a short-covering bounce.

**Key Levels:** 16.70, 18.40

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 16.90
- **Invalidation:** 18.80
---
### CRBG (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** No Demand

- **Invalidation:** 30.80

- **Invalidation:** 70.00
---
### CUZ (BEARISH)

- **Invalidation:** 24.50
---
### CVS (NEUTRAL)

- **Invalidation:** 73.00

- **Invalidation:** 46.00

- **Invalidation:** 220.00

- **Invalidation:** 75.00
---

- **Invalidation:** 34.00
---

- **Invalidation:** 27.00

- **Invalidation:** 38.50
---

---
### PLTU (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

- **Invalidation:** 43.12
---
### PRU (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Major supply entered on Feb 2 with wide spread down on high volume. The subsequent narrow spreads on Feb 9 and 16 with decreasing volume suggest the path of least resistance remains down until a significant test occurs.

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 102.04 support
- **Invalidation:** 106.94

### PSN (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax / Potential Bottom

- **Invalidation:** 59.13

#### Action Plan

- **Invalidation:** 150.75
---
### PTGX (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** No Professional Interest

**Smart Money Logic:**
Extremely low relative volume on Feb 16 (0.15) suggests neither side is aggressive. The lack of volume following a Buying Climax context in December points to a drift lower or sideways chop.

**Key Levels:** 77.69, 83.39, 86.10

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Volume spike above 20-day average with wide spread
- **Invalidation:** 80.39
---
### PYPL (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Bullish engulfing on high volume
- **Invalidation:** 51.80
---
### QTWO (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
High volume sell-off on Feb 9 confirmed the supply dominance. Feb 16 low volume signifies a pause in the move, but without a demand response, further downside is likely.

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Breakdown below 51.70
- **Invalidation:** 54.27
---

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** New low below 19.60
- **Invalidation:** 21.00
---
### RF (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Upthrust / Supply Entering

**Smart Money Logic:**
Feb 9 saw price attempt higher and fail on high volume (CLV -0.60). Feb 16 volume is extremely thin (0.22 RelVol), suggesting buyers are exhausted at these levels.

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 29.64
- **Invalidation:** 31.53
---
### RGLD (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Churning / Supply

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 288.95 with volume > 5M
- **Invalidation:** 272.54
---
### RGTI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Price consistently making lower highs and lower lows. Volume is tapering off (RelVol 0.22), which could lead to a drift lower rather than an immediate reversal. Supply is still in control from Jan 26 move.

**Key Levels:** 14.78, 16.69, 18.38

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 15.15
- **Invalidation:** 16.69
---
### RKT (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Absorption

---
### RLI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Demand at Highs

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 60.00
- **Invalidation:** 62.78
---
### RTO (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort vs Result (Bearish)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Feb 2 saw a huge volume spike (RelVol 2.86) but price barely moved up, suggesting high-level distribution. Feb 16 close at high on very low volume is likely a 'last gasp' or low-volume manipulation before a drop.

**Key Levels:** 30.04, 31.63, 32.77

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 30.55
- **Invalidation:** 32.00
---
### RVMD (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

- **Invalidation:** 101.53
---
### RYAAY (BULLISH)

- **Invalidation:** 64.61

- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 30.64
- **Invalidation:** 34.70
---
### SATS (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

- **Invalidation:** 116.47
---
### SPOT (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Distribution

- **Invalidation:** 487.23

- **Invalidation:** 77.11
---
### TROW (BEARISH)

**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Reversal Attempt

---
### WRB (BEARISH)

- **Invalidation:** 71.64
---
