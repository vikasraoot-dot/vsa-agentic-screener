- **Invalidation:** $155.10

### ARWR (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Demand / Supply Dominance Continuation

### AS (BULLISH PENDING CONFIRMATION)
**VSA Status:** No Supply Test

**Smart Money Logic:**

---
### AXTI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance Continuation

---
### AZN (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume Confirmation / No Supply Follow-Through

**Key Levels:** Immediate Support $93.08, Target $96.51

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close above $96.18 on increased volume.

- **Invalidation:** $108.52

### CMPO (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Context is BULLISH. The weekly chart shows a strong STOPPING_VOLUME bar (2026-01-12) with high volume (3.55 RelVol) on a wide spread, suggesting Smart Money absorbed supply after a short-lived markdown. The subsequent weeks saw significantly reduced volume (0.55 RelVol) on tight spreads, indicating a successful test/absorption of supply, specifically represented by the last bar's low volume and mid-range close (-0.37 CLV). The monthly chart also showed a massive bullish move in January (40M volume, 8.12 spread, 0.67 CLV) following two months of sideways/down movement, reinforcing the absorption thesis.

**Key Levels:** 24.09 (Weekly Support/Test Zone), 25.95 (Recent Weekly High), 26.50 (Monthly Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close above $25.32 (last week's high) on confirmation volume.
- **Invalidation:** $24.09 (Last week's low)

### CNQ (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Trend is BULLISH. The weekly chart confirms STOPPING_VOLUME (2026-01-05) on very high relative volume (2.05 RelVol) as the price dropped significantly and closed mid-range, signaling absorption. The subsequent weeks confirmed demand, with prices recovering sharply, culminating in the last week's low volume (0.33 RelVol) and very bullish close (0.83 CLV). Low volume on the last bar, especially with an UP close near the highs, indicates a lack of supply and readiness for markup.

**Key Levels:** 35.64 (Immediate Support), 36.76 (Recent High/Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close above $36.76 (Weekly High) on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** $35.64 (Last week's low)
---
### CORT (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Effort No Result

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly Trend is BEARISH, but strong reversal signs are present. The massive volume and wide spread down bar on 2025-12-29 (5.58 RelVol) was classic stopping volume, likely marking a selling climax. The subsequent weeks saw follow-through demand. The last two weeks (2026-01-19 and 2026-01-26) show strong bullish closes (0.84 and 0.96 CLV, respectively), confirming strong demand driving price higher despite the initial bearish context. The last bar is a narrow spread up bar on low volume (0.53 RelVol), indicating that the path of least resistance is up. The monthly chart confirms massive buying (CLV 0.99) driving price high in January.

**Key Levels:** 42.90 (Immediate Support), 46.28 (Recent High/Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close above $46.28 (recent high) on rising volume.
- **Invalidation:** $42.90 (Last week's low)

### CSGP (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Reaction

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Trend is BEARISH. The weekly chart showed extreme selling (2026-01-05: 2.06 RelVol, wide spread down, -0.98 CLV). The rally that followed (2026-01-12, 2026-01-19) was a reaction rally. The most recent bar (2026-01-26) saw high volume (1.03 RelVol) but closed near its low (-0.78 CLV) after touching the high of the day. This bar, despite the weekly down close, acts as a clear UPTHRUST, confirming supply is re-entering the market near $70.57. Monthly Stopping Volume is noted, but the immediate weekly action suggests a distribution phase continuation.

**Key Levels:** 70.57 (Upthrust Resistance), 65.68 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $65.68 (last week's low) on confirmation volume.

**Key Levels:** 21.74 (Immediate Resistance/Target), 19.81 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry on current strength or minor pull back to $21.00.

### FER (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply

The Quarterly Trend is BULLISH. After some volatility in January, the last weekly bar (2026-01-26) is a wide spread UP bar, closing near its high (0.96 CLV) on extremely low volume (0.29 RelVol). This is a strong No Supply signal in a bullish context, suggesting virtually zero selling interest remaining and confirming the path of least resistance is up.

**Key Levels:** 69.77 (Recent High/Target), 67.02 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Immediate entry or minor pullback to $69.00.
- **Invalidation:** $67.02 (Last week's low)

### FFIV (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Demand Emerging

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Trend is BULLISH. The monthly chart shows a potential STOPPING_VOLUME bar. The weekly sequence confirms emerging demand. The bar 2026-01-19 was a down bar with high spread and high volume, closing near its low (-0.59 CLV), suggesting supply dominance. However, the next bar (2026-01-26) showed an immediate recovery, closing UP (0.55 CLV) on low volume (0.69 RelVol). While not a perfect No Supply (volume is moderate), the strong close indicates immediate buying pressure absorbing any supply and regaining control.

**Key Levels:** 272.91 (Immediate Resistance), 261.85 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close above $272.91 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** $261.85 (Last week's low)

### FIBK (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Trend is BULLISH, but the Monthly indicates a potential BUYING_CLIMAX. The weekly price action shows choppy consolidation near the recent highs. The last weekly bar (2026-01-26) is an UP bar, closing high (0.57 CLV) on extremely low volume (0.18 RelVol). This signifies a classic No Supply bar, indicating sellers are absent. Given the consolidation occurred at previous resistance, this suggests accumulation and preparation for a further move up, provided the Buying Climax signal proves false.

**Key Levels:** 37.04 (Recent Resistance), 36.19 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close above $37.04 on confirmation volume.
- **Invalidation:** $36.19 (Last week's low)

### FRPT (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply

The Quarterly Trend is BULLISH. The Monthly sequence indicates STOPPING_VOLUME (CONFIRMED_EARLY). The weekly chart shows a very strong rally (2026-01-19, 1.01 RelVol, 0.69 CLV). The last bar (2026-01-26) is an UP bar, closing high (0.37 CLV, slightly off high) on exceptionally low volume (0.30 RelVol). This is a No Supply signal, confirming the breakout strength and indicating minimal selling pressure. The market is ready for a continuation of the markup.

**Key Levels:** 73.00 (Recent High/Target), 69.82 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry on current price strength or break above $73.00.

### GBCI (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Trend is BULLISH. After strong volume (1.15 RelVol) confirmed demand in the prior week (2026-01-19), the last weekly bar (2026-01-26) is an UP bar, closing high (0.62 CLV) on extremely low volume (0.38 RelVol). This low volume on a positive move indicates a No Supply condition. Smart Money is in control, and the stock is ready for markup continuation.

**Key Levels:** 49.08 (Recent High/Target), 47.32 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close above $49.08 on confirmation volume.
- **Invalidation:** $47.32 (Last week's low)

### GE (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Weakness

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Trend is BEARISH. The weekly chart confirms strong SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (CONFIRMED_EARLY). The week of 2026-01-19 was a high-volume (1.97 RelVol) wide spread down bar, closing near its low (-0.77 CLV), indicating heavy institutional selling. The last bar (2026-01-26) attempted a weak rally on low volume (0.66 RelVol) but closed mid-range (0.38 CLV). This poor rally effort following a high-volume breakdown confirms weakness and suggests the markdown phase is active.

**Key Levels:** 290.44 (Immediate Support), 300.63 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $290.44 on rising volume.
- **Invalidation:** $300.63 (Last week's high)
---
### GWRE (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Trend is BEARISH, and the weekly confirms SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (CONFIRMED_EARLY). The week of 2026-01-12 was a major breakdown bar (1.95 RelVol, wide spread down, -0.98 CLV). The subsequent week (2026-01-19) showed a reaction rally, but the last bar (2026-01-26) is a low-volume (0.41 RelVol) down bar, closing low (-0.42 CLV). This confirms the inability of the market to sustain a rally, validating the markdown phase. The low volume suggests lack of counter-demand.

**Key Levels:** 159.16 (Immediate Support), 163.05 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $159.16 on confirmation volume.
- **Invalidation:** $163.05 (Last week's high)
---
### HDB (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Trend is BEARISH, and the weekly confirms SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (CONFIRMED_EARLY). The week of 2026-01-05 saw massive selling volume (2.88 RelVol) on a wide down bar closing near the low (-0.91 CLV). This initiated a strong markdown. Subsequent weeks failed to rally meaningfully. The last bar (2026-01-26) is a narrow, low-volume (0.43 RelVol) bar closing mid-range (0.31 CLV). This weakness confirms the dominant bearish pressure from the massive selling climax/distribution event earlier in the month.

**Key Levels:** 32.04 (Immediate Support), 32.65 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $32.04 on confirmation volume.
- **Invalidation:** $32.65 (Last week's high)

### HRMY (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Trend is BULLISH, though the Monthly suggests SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (CONFIRMED_EARLY). The weekly charts show a recovery from the weakness. The last bar (2026-01-26) is an UP bar, closing high (0.58 CLV) on very low volume (0.28 RelVol). This is a strong No Supply signal, suggesting the prior supply has been absorbed and the price is ready to move up. The low volume indicates minimal friction.

**Key Levels:** 37.98 (Recent High/Target), 36.56 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close above $37.98 on confirmation volume.
- **Invalidation:** $36.56 (Last week's low)
---
### IONQ (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Selling Pressure

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Trend is BEARISH, and the Monthly indicates BUYING_CLIMAX (CONFIRMED_EARLY). The weekly chart shows a sharp sell-off from highs around $54. The bar 2026-01-19 was a wide spread down bar on high volume (0.70 RelVol) closing low (-0.63 CLV), confirming supply. The last bar (2026-01-26) is a wide spread down bar on low volume (0.52 RelVol) closing near the low (-0.31 CLV). This quiet selling confirms the presence of supply and failure of the previous rally, validating the bearish divergence signaled by the monthly Climax.

**Key Levels:** 42.84 (Recent Low Support), 50.59 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $42.84 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** $50.59 (Last week's high)

### IOT (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Weakness Confirmed

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Trend is BEARISH. The Monthly indicates BUYING_CLIMAX (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The weekly chart shows consistent weakness, failing to hold any rally attempts. The last bar (2026-01-26) is a wide spread down bar, closing near its low (-0.86 CLV) on low volume (0.49 RelVol). This indicates the path of least resistance is down, and there is no demand present to defend the markdown.

- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $30.41 on confirmation volume.
- **Invalidation:** $32.80 (Last week's high)
---
### IREN (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Trend is BULLISH. The monthly sequence warns of SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (WATCH_FOR_TEST), likely due to the massive volume bars earlier in the month/prior month. However, the last weekly bar (2026-01-26) is a strong UP bar, closing at the absolute high (0.99 CLV) on low volume (0.51 RelVol). This is a textbook No Supply bar, overriding the general distribution warning and suggesting the recent consolidation was accumulation/testing. Price is ready for markup.

**Key Levels:** 60.00 (Recent High/Target), 51.78 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Immediate entry or break above $60.00.
- **Invalidation:** $51.78 (Last week's low)

**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Confirmed Markdown

**Smart Money Logic:**

The week of 2026-01-19 was a high-volume (1.01 RelVol) wide spread down bar, closing near its low (-0.83 CLV), confirming heavy selling and distribution. The last bar (2026-01-26) is a narrow UP bar on low volume (0.49 RelVol), closing mid-range (0.26 CLV). This is a weak attempt at a rally, failing to re-enter the prior trading range, confirming the markdown phase continuation. The monthly chart shows CLV -0.81, confirming extreme monthly weakness.

**Key Levels:** 297.45 (Immediate Support), 301.96 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $297.45 on confirmation volume.

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Trend is BULLISH, but the Monthly indicates SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (CONFIRMED_EARLY). The weekly charts show price consolidation near the highs. The last bar (2026-01-26) is a strong UP bar, closing near the high (0.90 CLV) on extremely low volume (0.33 RelVol). This is a classic No Supply signal, indicating that the supply signaled by the monthly chart has been absorbed or tested successfully. The market is clear for a push higher.

**Key Levels:** 21.48 (Recent High/Target), 21.06 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close above $21.48 on confirmation volume.

### LQDA (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Trend is BULLISH, but the Monthly suggests SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (CONFIRMED_EARLY) from prior action. The weekly chart shows a strong rally throughout January. The last bar (2026-01-26) is an UP bar, closing high (0.49 CLV) on extremely low volume (0.27 RelVol). This is a clear No Supply signal, suggesting a successful test and lack of sellers, confirming the upward direction.

**Key Levels:** 43.42 (Recent High/Target), 39.71 (Immediate Support)

### MSFU (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Demand Emerging

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Trend is BEARISH, but the Monthly suggests SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The weekly chart shows a sharp reversal. The week of 2026-01-19 was a high-volume (1.94 RelVol) down bar that rallied to close high (0.68 CLV), suggesting demand overwhelmed supply (possibly stopping volume). The last bar (2026-01-26) is an UP bar, closing high (0.79 CLV) on moderate volume (0.77 RelVol). The strong recovery and high close confirm immediate demand follow-through, likely invalidating the immediate bearish trend.

**Key Levels:** 40.85 (Recent High/Target), 37.47 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close above $40.85 on confirmation volume.
- **Invalidation:** $37.47 (Last week's low)

### NFXL (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Accumulation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Trend is BEARISH. The weekly chart confirms STOPPING_VOLUME (CONFIRMED_EARLY) on 2026-01-19, with very high volume (3.34 RelVol) and a wide spread down, but closing at the high (-0.006 CLV is misleadingly neutral, the bar range is huge). This suggests massive absorption. The final bar (2026-01-26) is a low-volume (0.82 RelVol) narrow bar, closing mid-range (0.13 CLV). This low-volume action immediately following the climax suggests a successful quiet test/accumulation phase. Smart Money is likely in control near the lows.

**Key Levels:** 24.24 (Immediate Support), 26.01 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close above $26.01 on rising volume.
- **Invalidation:** $24.24 (Last week's low)

**VSA Status:** Selling Pressure Confirmed

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Trend is BEARISH, and the Monthly confirms BUYING_CLIMAX (CONFIRMED_EARLY) in January. The week of 2026-01-05 saw a massive spread up on high volume, signaling a Climax. The two subsequent weeks (2026-01-12 and 2026-01-19) showed steep markdown on high volume. The last bar (2026-01-26) is a narrow down bar on very low volume (0.22 RelVol) closing mid-range (0.44 CLV). The low volume confirms No Demand to rally the price, and the price remains in a markdown phase following the massive climax.

**Key Levels:** 81.13 (Recent Low Support), 86.85 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $81.13 on confirmation volume.
- **Invalidation:** $86.85 (Last week's high)
---
### ONB (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Trend is BULLISH. The Monthly sequence signals strong SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (CONFIRMED_STRONG), suggesting accumulation is required. The weekly chart shows tight trading near $23. The last bar (2026-01-26) is an UP bar, closing near its high (0.80 CLV) on extremely low volume (0.24 RelVol). This is a strong No Supply signal. Given the positive close and extreme lack of selling, the market is confirming demand presence in the short term, preparing for markup.

**Key Levels:** 23.93 (Recent High/Target), 23.37 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close above $23.93 on confirmation volume.
- **Invalidation:** $23.37 (Last week's low)
---
### OZK (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Weakness Confirmed

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Trend is BULLISH, but the weekly confirms SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (CONFIRMED_EARLY). The week of 2026-01-19 was a high-volume (2.06 RelVol) wide spread down bar, closing near the low (-0.91 CLV), indicating clear institutional distribution. The last bar (2026-01-26) is a narrow UP bar on very low volume (0.44 RelVol) closing mid-range (0.43 CLV). This low-volume reaction rally confirms the lack of demand following the major distribution, indicating weakness is now dominant.

**Key Levels:** 45.64 (Immediate Support), 46.80 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $45.64 on confirmation volume.
- **Invalidation:** $46.80 (Last week's high)
---
### PGY (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Weakness / No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Trend is BEARISH. The monthly sequence suggests SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The weekly chart shows a Buying Climax failure followed by markdown. The last bar (2026-01-26) is a down bar, closing near its low (-0.75 CLV) on very low volume (0.32 RelVol). This is a strong signal of No Demand, confirming that the path of least resistance is down and the markdown phase is likely continuing.

**Key Levels:** 20.55 (Recent Low Support), 22.29 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $20.55 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** $22.29 (Last week's high)
---
### QQQI (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Trend is BULLISH. The Monthly suggests BUYING_CLIMAX (WATCH_FOR_TEST), but the weekly chart shows clear strength. The last bar (2026-01-26) is an UP bar, closing near the high (0.77 CLV) on low volume (0.39 RelVol). This is a strong No Supply signal in a bullish context, suggesting that supply has been absorbed or successfully tested, clearing the way for further markup. The prior down week (2026-01-12) was absorbed well by the following rally.

**Key Levels:** 54.45 (Recent High/Target), 53.84 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Immediate entry or break above $54.45.
- **Invalidation:** $53.84 (Last week's low)
---
### RGTI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result Down (Weakness)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly context is BEARISH, and the monthly is confirmed BUYING_CLIMAX (potential distribution). The last weekly bar was a wide-spread down bar (Spread: 2.38) closing near the low (CLV: -0.24), yet volume was very low (RelVol: 0.18). This is an Effort No Result Down signal: the wide spread down on low volume suggests a complete lack of demand (lack of institutional buyers). The previous week's bar was a significant down bar on high volume, confirming the selling pressure. This low volume bar suggests the downtrend is proceeding without opposition.

**Key Levels:** 23.78 (Recent High/Supply), 21.39 (Recent Low), 26.70 (Buying Climax High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry below $21.39 (Break of recent support/low volume test failure).
- **Invalidation:** $23.78 (High of the current effort bar)
---
### RLI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Test of Supply (Weakness Confirmed)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly context is BEARISH. The monthly sequence is WATCH_FOR_TEST following a Buying Climax/Supply entry. The last weekly bar is a wide-spread down bar (Spread: 2.41) closing near the low (CLV: -0.76) on below-average volume (RelVol: 0.58). This suggests the market is attempting to shake out buyers, but the move down is relatively easy despite the drop in volume, confirming a lack of demand. The preceding high volume selling (Week 01/19) indicated institutional distribution, and this weak follow-through suggests the path of least resistance remains down.

**Key Levels:** 59.45 (Recent High/Resistance), 57.03 (Recent Low Support), 63.74 (Monthly Supply)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry below $57.00 (Break of recent support).
- **Invalidation:** $59.45 (High of the test bar)
---
### RTO (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Upthrust/Stopping Volume (Confirmed)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The overall quarterly trend is BULLISH. The weekly sequence shows STOPPING_VOLUME confirmed, indicating successful absorption of supply. The last bar is a narrow-spread up bar, closing at the high (CLV: 0.99) on extremely low volume (RelVol: 0.50). This low volume push to a new high, immediately following two high-volume wide-spread up bars (Weeks 01/12 and 01/19), is a classic Sign of Strength (SoS) and No Supply/Test in the markup phase. Smart Money has cleared the path; the market is ready to move higher without resistance.

**Key Levels:** 33.45 (New High/Resistance Test), 32.70 (Immediate Support), 31.54 (Breakout Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Long entry above $33.46 (Breakout of high) or on a low volume pull back to $33.00.
- **Invalidation:** $32.70 (Below the recent swing low)
---
### RVMD (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Reversal/Stopping Volume (Major Shakeout)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stock experienced a massive high volume thrust (Week 01/05), followed by diminishing supply (Weeks 01/12 and 01/19). The last weekly bar is a wide-spread up bar (Spread: 9.43) closing strongly (CLV: 0.55), confirming demand is returning after the sharp drop and volatility, albeit on average volume (RelVol: 0.98). Crucially, the monthly bar shows a massive range with significant volatility (CLV: -0.02), suggesting a major shakeout/reaccumulation near the lows of that monthly range. The last weekly bar's recovery off the lows (92.50) confirms the bulls are defending the accumulation zone, signaling a potential markup continuation.

**Key Levels:** 124.49 (Major Supply), 92.50 (Shakeout Low Support), 118.64 (Previous High Pivot)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Long entry above $101.93 (Short-term high) with confirmation volume.
- **Invalidation:** $92.50 (Shakeout low)
---
### SA (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Test (Weakness Confirmation)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the monthly sequence is WATCH_FOR_TEST for Supply Dominance. The week of 01/19 showed a high volume thrust up (CLV: 0.48), immediately followed by a wide-spread down bar (Spread: 5.51) closing near the low (CLV: -0.34) on slightly below-average volume (RelVol: 0.54). This high-to-low reversal on the last bar, consuming the gains of the prior strong bar, is a clear signal of institutional selling/supply entering the market, negating the prior effort. Smart Money is distributing near the highs ($37.99).

**Key Levels:** 37.99 (Distribution High), 32.48 (Immediate Support), 36.37 (Prior Support Failure)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry below $34.00 (Break of recent consolidation/close).
- **Invalidation:** $37.99 (High of Distribution)
---
### SARO (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Demand (Confirmed Buying Climax)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the weekly sequence is confirmed BUYING_CLIMAX. The week of 01/19 showed extreme high volume (RelVol: 3.73) on a wide bar that closed in the middle/low (CLV: 0.07), a massive Selling Climax (or Buying Climax failure). The final weekly bar is a narrow-spread up bar (Spread: 1.19) closing near the high (CLV: 0.43) on extremely low relative volume (RelVol: 0.30). This is a textbook No Demand signal confirming the prior climax bar was likely distribution/stopping volume. The market has no energy to sustain the upward move.

**Key Levels:** 34.48 (Buying Climax High), 32.27 (Immediate Support), 31.22 (Accumulation Point)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry below $32.27 (Break of recent low support).
- **Invalidation:** $33.50 (Above the current small swing high)
---
### TFX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result Down (Confirmed Supply)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The overall context is BEARISH (Quarterly & Weekly Supply Dominance). The last two weeks showed large spread down bars (01/05 and 01/12) on high volume, confirming Smart Money distribution. The last weekly bar is a narrow spread down bar, closing near the middle/low (CLV: -0.07) on below-average volume (RelVol: 0.62). This bar shows a lack of demand. The narrow spread on low volume indicates that the market struggles to move up, confirming the presence of supply overhead and an ongoing markdown. Low volume makes the price drop easily.

**Key Levels:** 106.24 (Immediate Resistance/Supply), 103.01 (Recent Low Support), 100.18 (Major Low Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry below $103.00 (Break of consolidation low).
- **Invalidation:** $106.24 (High of the test bar)
---
### VONG (NEUTRAL/BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply / Low Volume Up

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly context is BEARISH, but the monthly sequence is WATCH_FOR_TEST for Stopping Volume. The weekly sequence shows confirmed SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (Weeks 01/05 and 01/12) followed by a Sign of Strength/Test (Week 01/19, up bar closing high). The last weekly bar is a narrow spread up bar, closing strongly (CLV: 0.63) on very low relative volume (RelVol: 0.24). This is a strong No Supply signal confirming that the path upward is clear after the previous selling pressure. Smart Money has absorbed the supply and is letting the price drift higher easily.

**Key Levels:** 123.60 (Immediate Resistance/Supply), 120.56 (Immediate Support), 117.63 (Major Low Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Long entry on a break above $122.41 (Recent short-term high).
- **Invalidation:** $120.56 (Below the prior bar's open/low)
---
### WGMI (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply / Sign of Strength

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BULLISH, and the monthly is WATCH_FOR_TEST following a Buying Climax. The last weekly bar is a wide-spread up bar (Spread: 4.92) closing near the high (CLV: 0.88) on below-average volume (RelVol: 0.49). This is a strong indication that supply has completely vanished, allowing the market to move up easily with little institutional effort required. This No Supply signal confirms strong underlying demand following the significant markup phase (Week 01/12). Smart Money is likely marking the price up.

**Key Levels:** 51.78 (Recent High/Supply Test), 48.77 (Immediate Support), 45.11 (Shakeout Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Long entry above $51.78 (Breakout of resistance zone).
- **Invalidation:** $48.77 (Below the current bar's open/minor support)
---
### WRB (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Demand / Test (Weakness Confirmed)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BEARISH, and the monthly is WATCH_FOR_TEST of Supply Dominance. The last three weeks show sequential selling pressure confirmed by wide spreads down (Weeks 01/05, 01/12, 01/19). The last weekly bar is a wide spread down bar (Spread: 4.59) closing near the middle/low (CLV: -0.11), on low relative volume (RelVol: 0.57). This low volume drop on a wide spread indicates No Demand (Effort No Result Down). Buyers are absent, allowing the price to fall easily. This confirms the ongoing supply dominance.

**Key Levels:** 69.78 (Immediate Supply), 65.19 (Recent Low Support), 68.44 (Prior Low Pivot)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry below $65.19 (Break of support).
- **Invalidation:** $69.78 (High of the test bar)
---
## 👀 Watch/Monitoring
### ABT (NEUTRAL/BULLISH PENDING CONFIRMATION)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax followed by Secondary Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
Extreme volume (2.57 RelVol on 01-19) indicates a massive Selling Climax (capitulation). The subsequent week was a low volume pullback, suggesting supply is diminished but a definitive Sign of Strength is needed to confirm accumulation.

**Key Levels:** SC Low: $105.78, SC High: $122.49, Current Trading Range: $106 - $110

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close above $110.40 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** $105.77
---
### ACLX (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume/Shakeout followed by Potential No Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
The massive reversal bar (01-19) on high volume looks like a Shakeout or Stopping Volume in a bullish quarterly context. The last week (01-26) is narrow, low volume (0.42 RelVol), suggesting temporary No Supply, but a clear sign of strength is required to confirm absorption.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Support $66.55, Supply Zone $70.11 - $76.50, Swing Low Support $60.35

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close above $69.70 on high volume, or a successful low volume test below $66.55.
- **Invalidation:** $66.55
---
### ACN (NEUTRAL/BEARISH SHORT TERM)
**VSA Status:** No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
The bullish rally stalled, leading to a down bar on extremely low volume (0.29 RelVol) closing near the low (01-26). This No Demand signal suggests short-term weakness and likely a deeper secondary test of recent support.

**Key Levels:** Recent High Resistance $291.09, Key Support $272.22

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Low volume test of $272.22 or a confirmed reversal above $284.60.
- **Invalidation:** $284.59
---
### AIG (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance Continuation / Weak Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
Heavy selling volume (01-05, 01-12) confirmed strong supply dominance. The subsequent low volume up bar (01-26) suggests weak demand and an inability to reverse the downtrend.

**Key Levels:** Resistance $74.40, Support $72.80

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close below $72.80 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** $74.41
---
### AIQ (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Positive Low Volume Follow-Through (No Supply)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The strong demand bar on 01-19 indicates strength. The subsequent narrow, high CLV up bar (01-26) on ultra-low volume (0.22 RelVol) suggests a lack of supply, allowing for an effortless continuation of the rally.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Support $52.31, Target $53.25 (Previous High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close above $53.22 on increased volume.
- **Invalidation:** $52.31
---
### BABX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result Up / No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
High volume churning (01-12) followed by a low volume rally (01-26, 0.44 RelVol) that failed to close high. This confirms institutional distribution and suggests weakness, aligning with the BEARISH quarterly context.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Resistance $50.68, Support $46.36

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close below $46.36 on increased volume.
- **Invalidation:** $50.68
---
### BBT (NEUTRAL/BEARISH PENDING CONFIRMATION)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result Up / Weak Rally

**Smart Money Logic:**
Supply entered on 01-19 (E.N.R. Up). The subsequent narrow up bar (01-26) is on ultra-low volume (0.24 RelVol). Given the monthly Buying Climax warning, this low volume move suggests demand is fragile and vulnerable to a sharp reversal (Upthrust).

**Key Levels:** Immediate Resistance $28.52, Support $27.71

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close below $27.71 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** $28.53
---
### BKKT (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Weak Secondary Test / No Demand Rally

**Smart Money Logic:**
The strong reversal (SOW) on 01-19 confirmed supply dominance. The subsequent rally attempt (01-26) is on ultra-low volume (0.22 RelVol), indicating No Demand and a failure of the secondary test. Expecting markdown.

**Key Levels:** Resistance $15.13, SOW Low Support $14.50

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close below $13.69 (01-26 low) on volume.
- **Invalidation:** $15.14
---
### BKSY (NEUTRAL/BEARISH PENDING CONFIRMATION)
**VSA Status:** Effortless Rally (Potential Upthrust)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Rally momentum faded (E.N.R. 01-12/01-19) under the influence of the Monthly Buying Climax. The final bar is an effortless advance (0.35 RelVol, 0.91 CLV). Lack of volume makes this rally suspicious and prone to an Upthrust/reversal.

**Key Levels:** Resistance $26.98, Support $24.03

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close below $26.86 (01-26 close) on volume.
- **Invalidation:** $26.99
---
### BRBR (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Supply Testing Demand / Effort No Result Down

**Smart Money Logic:**
Demand surged on 01-19, challenging the bearish trend. However, the 01-26 pullback on lower volume had a wide spread and low CLV, suggesting supply is still active and testing the demand. Status is neutral until one side confirms control.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Support $24.64, Resistance $27.11

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close above $27.66 on high volume.
- **Invalidation:** $24.63
---
### BXSL (BEARISH PENDING CONFIRMATION)
**VSA Status:** No Demand Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
Supply entered strongly on 01-19 (SOW). The subsequent narrow up bar (01-26) on ultra-low volume (0.46 RelVol) is a weak No Demand rally, suggesting the market is ready for markdown.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Resistance $26.46, Support $25.80

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close below $25.80 on increased volume.
- **Invalidation:** $26.46
---
### CBRL (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Sign of Weakness / No Demand Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
Effort No Result (01-12) followed by SOW (01-19) suggests distribution is occurring. The low volume recovery (01-26, 0.36 RelVol) is a weak No Demand signal, suggesting the bearish trend will resume.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Resistance $30.46, Support $29.95

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close below $29.95 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** $30.47
---
### CNXC (NEUTRAL/WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Upthrust Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly Trend is BULLISH. The week of 2026-01-12 showed high volume (2.00 RelVol) on a wide spread, signaling either heavy stopping volume or a major Upthrust reaction near $43.87. The last bar, 2026-01-26, is a low-volume down bar (0.38 RelVol) closing near the low (-0.77 CLV). This suggests supply is still present (or demand is hesitant) following the initial high-volume bar. We need to see clear demand entry to confirm the absorption thesis.

**Key Levels:** 41.37 (Key Support), 43.87 (Recent Resistance/Upthrust Zone)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A strong rally bar closing above $43.44 on high volume.
- **Invalidation:** $41.37 (Last week's low)
---
### CPNG (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Trend is BEARISH. The weekly sequence shows consistent SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The week of 2026-01-12 saw very high volume (2.07 RelVol) on a wide spread down bar, closing near the low (-0.62 CLV), confirming heavy selling pressure. The last bar (2026-01-26) saw high volume (1.43 RelVol) but only managed a mid-range close (0.54 CLV), suggesting some demand absorption, but the overall context remains overwhelmingly bearish (Monthly CLV -0.40, large selling effort). This is likely a minor reaction rally within a downtrend.

**Key Levels:** 18.55 (Recent Low Support), 21.13 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $18.55 (recent swing low) on high volume.
- **Invalidation:** $21.13 (Previous week's high)
---
### CRBG (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Neutral / Effort No Result

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Trend is BEARISH, but the weekly sequence shows tight, overlapping price action on reducing volume. The last bar is an UP bar on very low volume (0.27 RelVol) with a weak close (0.13 CLV). This suggests an extremely tight trading range, indicating either a lack of interest or quiet accumulation/distribution. Given the Monthly BUYING_CLIMAX warning, accumulation seems unlikely unless a definitive low-volume test occurs. The lack of commitment on the last low-volume bar suggests neutrality or a hidden redistribution attempt.

**Key Levels:** 29.95 (Immediate Support), 30.42 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a clear break above $30.66 or below $29.35 with confirmed volume.
- **Invalidation:** $29.35 (Recent low)
---
### CTRA (NEUTRAL/BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Effort No Result

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Trend is BULLISH, but the recent action is concerning. The week of 2026-01-12 showed extreme volume (2.08 RelVol) on a wide spread down bar, closing near the low (-0.46 CLV), indicative of a possible Buying Climax followed by Smart Money distribution. The last bar (2026-01-26) is a very narrow UP bar on very low volume (0.33 RelVol), failing to make new highs. This lack of effort for the reward achieved, following the high volume warning, suggests demand is drying up and distribution is occurring.

**Key Levels:** 27.80 (Immediate Resistance), 27.00 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $27.00 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** $27.90 (Last week's high)
---
### DOW (NEUTRAL/BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Weakness

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Trend is BULLISH, but the Monthly Sequence is SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The weekly chart confirms this: after strong rally bars, the last bar (2026-01-26) is a down bar on significantly reduced volume (0.36 RelVol) closing near the low (-0.63 CLV). This low-volume weakness, particularly after failing to break above $28.56, suggests Smart Money is not supporting the price movement here, confirming the monthly distribution signal. The recent markup is struggling for continuation.

**Key Levels:** 27.64 (Immediate Support), 28.56 (Recent Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $27.64 with volume confirmation.
- **Invalidation:** $28.56 (Last week's high)
---
### DUOL (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Weakness Confirmed

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Trend is BEARISH. The weekly chart shows continuous markdown. The week of 2026-01-12 was a massive wide spread down bar on high volume (1.61 RelVol), closing near its low (-0.78 CLV), confirming strong institutional selling (Selling Climax). The brief reaction rally (2026-01-19) failed, and the most recent bar (2026-01-26) is a down bar on very low volume (0.39 RelVol), closing near the low (-0.68 CLV). This low-volume weakness indicates no demand and confirms the bearish trend continuation towards the support of the selling climax.

**Key Levels:** 144.20 (Recent Low Support), 155.89 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $144.20 on confirmation volume.
- **Invalidation:** $155.89 (Last week's high)
---
### FISV (NEUTRAL/BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Upthrust Test / Weakness

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Trend is BULLISH, but the Monthly indicates SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The weekly chart is complex: a high-volume down bar (2026-01-12, 1.42 RelVol, -0.82 CLV) was followed by a recovery bar (2026-01-19). The last bar (2026-01-26) is a low-volume (0.50 RelVol) down bar, closing mid-to-low range (-0.27 CLV). The price failed to break decisively above the prior week's high ($67.63), and the quiet selling suggests Smart Money is not interested in pushing it higher, confirming the monthly weakness signal.

**Key Levels:** 65.36 (Immediate Support), 67.91 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $65.36 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** $67.91 (Last week's high)
---
### GKOS (NEUTRAL/BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Test of Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Trend is BULLISH, but the Monthly indicates BUYING_CLIMAX. The weekly chart shows a Buying Climax warning (2026-01-12: 1.25 RelVol, wide spread, high close). This was followed immediately by a sharp pullback (2026-01-19: -0.71 CLV, high volume). The last bar (2026-01-26) is a low-volume (0.32 RelVol) down bar closing mid-range (-0.49 CLV). The low volume suggests a test for supply, but the negative CLV shows sellers briefly overcame buyers. The immediate focus is on whether the supply absorption from the Climax is complete. Neutral until a clear break occurs.

**Key Levels:** 116.74 (Immediate Support), 124.39 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a clear break above $124.39 or below $116.74.
- **Invalidation:** $116.74 (Last week's low)
---
### GNTX (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** No Supply / Weakness

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Trend is BULLISH, but the Monthly suggests SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The weekly range is very tight. The last bar (2026-01-26) is a narrow UP bar on extremely low volume (0.33 RelVol), closing high (0.70 CLV). While low volume and a high close usually indicate No Supply (BULLISH), the overall chart shows poor momentum, confirming the monthly weakness. The price is grinding sideways near the top of a range, suggesting Smart Money might be holding, but major demand is absent.

**Key Levels:** 23.42 (Immediate Support), 23.92 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close above $23.92 with increased volume.
- **Invalidation:** $23.42 (Last week's low)

### HPE (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Upthrust Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Trend is BEARISH, but the Monthly sequence shows STOPPING_VOLUME (CONFIRMED_EARLY). The weekly chart shows a potential Selling Climax (2026-01-05/01-12) with high volume and wide spreads. The rally attempt in the last week (2026-01-26) was on extremely low volume (0.15 RelVol) but managed an UP close (0.41 CLV). This low-volume move upwards is ambiguous; it could be a low-volume test of supply (bullish) or simply a lack of interest (neutral). Given the bearish context and confirmed monthly stopping volume, we treat this as consolidation after climax.

**Key Levels:** 21.02 (Immediate Support), 21.84 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Clear break above $21.84 on high volume.
- **Invalidation:** $21.02 (Last week's low)
---
### IMAX (NEUTRAL/BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Emerging

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Trend is BEARISH, with Monthly STOPPING_VOLUME noted. The weekly chart saw a strong reversal bar (2026-01-12, 1.22 RelVol, 0.91 CLV). However, the price failed to hold the gains in the subsequent week (2026-01-19, high volume down bar, -0.82 CLV). The last bar (2026-01-26) is a very narrow, low-volume (0.22 RelVol) bar closing mid-range (-0.12 CLV). The lack of bullish follow-through and the small effort on very low volume suggests uncertainty and emerging supply pressure. The monthly stopping volume is being tested.

**Key Levels:** 34.32 (Immediate Support), 35.30 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $34.32 on confirmation volume.
- **Invalidation:** $35.30 (Last week's high)
---
### INVH (NEUTRAL/BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Weakness

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Trend is BEARISH. The weekly chart had a massive stopping volume event (2026-01-05: 2.57 RelVol, wide spread down). The immediate reaction (2026-01-12) was a strong recovery (1.27 RelVol, 0.99 CLV). However, the strength failed to hold. The last bar (2026-01-26) is a narrow down bar on very low volume (0.38 RelVol) closing near the low (-0.82 CLV). This low-volume weakness indicates that Smart Money did not follow through on the absorption, suggesting the price is vulnerable to further markdown.

**Key Levels:** 26.71 (Immediate Support/Test Low), 27.39 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $26.71 on confirmation volume.
- **Invalidation:** $27.39 (Last week's high)
---
### ITT (NEUTRAL/BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Upthrust Test / Weakness

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Trend is BEARISH. The Monthly indicates SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The weekly chart shows a lack of decisive upward momentum. The last bar (2026-01-26) is a narrow down bar on very low volume (0.30 RelVol), closing near the low (-0.93 CLV). This is a failed low-volume rally/test, indicating inherent weakness and confirming that the path of least resistance is likely down, validating the monthly weakness signal.

**Key Levels:** 182.85 (Immediate Support), 185.82 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $182.85 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** $185.82 (Last week's high)
---
### KDP (NEUTRAL/BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Demand / Low Volume Grind

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Trend is BEARISH. The Monthly sequence indicates a potential BUYING_CLIMAX. The weekly chart shows very tight, overlapping price action (churning) on low volume. The last bar (2026-01-26) is a narrow UP bar on very low volume (0.23 RelVol) closing mid-range (0.33 CLV). This is a No Demand situation in a tight range. Given the bearish quarterly context, this low-volume grind suggests weakness and potential for a downward continuation once the range breaks.

**Key Levels:** 27.21 (Immediate Support), 27.78 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $27.21 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** $27.78 (Last week's high)
---
### KVYO (NEUTRAL/WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Weak Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Trend is BEARISH. The weekly chart confirms STOPPING_VOLUME (CONFIRMED_EARLY) on 2026-01-12 (1.03 RelVol, wide spread down, -0.96 CLV). This was followed by a reaction rally (2026-01-19). The last bar (2026-01-26) is a narrow down bar on very low volume (0.25 RelVol) closing low (-0.25 CLV). This low-volume down movement following the rally is a weak test. While low volume suggests supply is absent, the weak close prevents a strong bullish verdict. It remains in the accumulation/testing phase near the lows.

**Key Levels:** 24.88 (Immediate Support), 26.33 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A strong rally bar closing above $26.33 on rising volume.
- **Invalidation:** $24.88 (Last week's low)
---
### KYMR (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Test of Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Trend is BULLISH, but the Monthly signals a BUYING_CLIMAX. The weekly chart shows volatility following the climax warning, pulling back sharply in the week of 2026-01-12. The last bar (2026-01-26) is an UP bar, closing high (0.59 CLV) on extremely low volume (0.31 RelVol). This is a No Supply signal, indicating successful absorption or resting of supply after the shakeout. Given the prior volatility, the lack of selling is a positive sign, but the overall context remains messy due to the climax warning.

**Key Levels:** 68.29 (Immediate Support), 73.15 (Recent High/Target)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close above $73.15 on confirmation volume.
- **Invalidation:** $68.29 (Last week's low)
---
### LHX (NEUTRAL/BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Trend is BULLISH, but the weekly chart confirms a major BUYING_CLIMAX (CONFIRMED_EARLY) in the week of 2026-01-12, with extremely high volume (2.09 RelVol) and a wide spread, but closing mid-range (-0.05 CLV). This suggests heavy Smart Money distribution at the highs. The subsequent rally (2026-01-19) failed to make new highs. The last bar (2026-01-26) is an UP bar on very low volume (0.40 RelVol), managing a high close (0.66 CLV). This low-volume effort suggests a final push or weak follow-through, but the massive distribution bar earlier provides strong bearish context.

**Key Levels:** 362.42 (Climax High), 351.48 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $351.48 on rising volume.
- **Invalidation:** $362.42 (Recent High)
---
### MAN (NEUTRAL/BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Weakness / No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Trend is BULLISH, but the Monthly suggests SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The weekly chart shows prices struggling to break out. The last bar (2026-01-26) is a down bar on very low volume (0.27 RelVol), closing mid-range (-0.29 CLV). The low volume on the down movement suggests No Demand. Given the context of monthly weakness and failure to continue the rally, this pattern favors the bearish side, indicating continued consolidation or markdown.

**Key Levels:** 29.60 (Immediate Support), 31.03 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $29.60 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** $31.03 (Last week's high)
---
### MOD (NEUTRAL/BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Upthrust

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Trend is BEARISH. The weekly chart confirms STOPPING_VOLUME (CONFIRMED_EARLY) on 2026-01-05 (2.84 RelVol, wide spread, mid-range close). The price rallied strongly (2026-01-19). The last bar (2026-01-26) attempted to break the $150.75 high on low volume (0.33 RelVol) but closed off the high (-0.35 CLV). The low volume test failure suggests supply is still present (Upthrust test). However, the price held the range, indicating Smart Money is still absorbing. Neutral pending confirmation of the test result.

**Key Levels:** 143.62 (Immediate Support), 153.66 (Upthrust High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Clear break and close above $153.66 on rising volume.
- **Invalidation:** $143.62 (Last week's low)
---
### NICE (NEUTRAL/BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Weakness / Upthrust Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Trend is BULLISH, but the Monthly suggests SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (WATCH_FOR_TEST). After a rally in the first two weeks of January, the last two bars showed weakness. The last bar (2026-01-26) is a narrow down bar on very low volume (0.26 RelVol) closing low (-0.39 CLV). This low-volume weakness indicates a lack of demand and a failure to sustain the price level, confirming the pressure signaled by the monthly sequence. Neutral, but leaning bearish until the range breaks.

**Key Levels:** 112.25 (Immediate Support), 117.21 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $112.25 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** $117.21 (Last week's high)
---
### OC (NEUTRAL/BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Weakness / Upthrust Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Trend is BULLISH, but the Monthly suggests STOPPING_VOLUME (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The weekly chart saw a major rally (2026-01-05). The last bar (2026-01-26) attempted to set a new high but reversed sharply, closing near the low (-0.85 CLV) on very low volume (0.33 RelVol). This is a low-volume Upthrust (failure to sustain rally) that indicates supply is present just above, and demand is currently absent/weak. The bearish nature of the close suggests immediate downside risk.

**Key Levels:** 120.88 (Immediate Support), 125.30 (Upthrust High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $120.88 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** $125.30 (Last week's high)
---
### PSN (NEUTRAL/BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Weakness

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Trend is BEARISH, and the Monthly confirms SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (CONFIRMED_EARLY) via the massive down bar in December. The weekly chart shows a strong reaction rally (2026-01-05, 1.41 RelVol, 0.97 CLV), but the strength immediately dissipated. The last bar (2026-01-26) is a narrow down bar on very low volume (0.40 RelVol), closing mid-range (0.09 CLV). The low volume and failure to sustain the rally indicate weakness and confirmation that the prior selling pressure remains dominant.

**Key Levels:** 69.18 (Immediate Support), 73.26 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $69.18 on confirmation volume.
- **Invalidation:** $73.26 (Last week's high)
---
### PTGX (NEUTRAL/BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Weakness / No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Trend is BEARISH. The Monthly suggests BUYING_CLIMAX (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The weekly chart shows volatility around the highs. The last bar (2026-01-26) is a narrow down bar on extremely low volume (0.20 RelVol) closing mid-range (-0.04 CLV). This is a No Demand signal, indicating sellers are absent, but buyers are not aggressive either. Given the bearish context and high prices, the lack of demand suggests vulnerability.

**Key Levels:** 81.94 (Immediate Support), 84.32 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $81.94 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** $84.32 (Last week's high)
---
### QTWO (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly context is a confirmed SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The last weekly bar closed near its low (CLV: -0.84) on very low relative volume (RelVol: 0.23). This suggests that Smart Money is absent on the downside, but the selling pressure of the previous weeks (Supply Dominance sequence, wide spread down bar in January) implies distribution is ongoing. The current bar is an Effort No Result Down, as the spread is wide (4.58) compared to the low volume, indicating weakness, especially after a failure to hold gains from the prior week.

**Key Levels:** 72.50 (Monthly Supply), 68.50 (Previous Support/Resistance), 64.78 (Recent Low Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry below $64.77 (Last low).
- **Invalidation:** $70.52 (High of effort bar's predecessor)
---
### RARE (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** No Supply / Low Volume Down

**Smart Money Logic:**
The overall trend is BEARISH (Quarterly & Weekly Supply Dominance). However, the last weekly bar closed near the middle (CLV: 0.16) on extremely low relative volume (RelVol: 0.36) and a narrow spread (0.91). This suggests demand is currently very low, but sellers are also exhausted (No Supply/Selling pressure). Since the monthly sequence is WATCH_FOR_TEST, we need to see how the market reacts to the established supply zone. Low volume in a downtrend region suggests weakness, but the lack of selling follow-through makes it NEUTRAL/WATCHFUL.

**Key Levels:** 25.10 (Recent High/Supply), 22.00 (Recent Low Support), 18.41 (Major Monthly Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry if volume increases significantly on a move below $24.09 (Current minor support).
- **Invalidation:** $25.10 (High of the current range)
---
### RF (NEUTRAL/BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Demand Returning (Up Bar, Low Volume)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the monthly sequence is SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (Watch for Test). The last weekly bar was a narrow spread up bar, closing near its high (CLV: 0.77) but on very low relative volume (RelVol: 0.25). This is often an indication of low supply/lack of sustained selling effort following the prior high volume down bar (Week of 01/19, CLV: -0.74). The Smart Money is letting the price stabilize after recent volatility. It suggests weak supply after the shakeout, but confirmation is needed.

**Key Levels:** 29.26 (Recent High), 27.25 (Test Support/Recent Low), 28.52 (Mid-range Pivot)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Long entry on a high volume breakout above $28.00.
- **Invalidation:** $27.25 (Recent low)
---
### RGLD (NEUTRAL/BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Potential Stopping Volume/End of Thrust

**Smart Money Logic:**
The overall context is a strong BULLISH trend. The current monthly bar is a massive up bar with high volume (RelVol 1.26), closing near its high, indicating strong buying. However, the last weekly bar is a wide-spread up bar closing in the middle (CLV: 0.34) on significantly lower volume (RelVol: 0.41) compared to the preceding thrust bar. This hints at either absorption near the highs or diminishing interest (End of Thrust). Given the monthly BUYING_CLIMAX context is implied by the large move and high volume, Smart Money may be stepping back, waiting for a test or reversal signal. This low volume up move near the high is a warning sign of underlying weakness.

**Key Levels:** 299.60 (All-time High/Supply), 281.70 (Potential Accumulation Support), 265.12 (Previous high pivot)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on a sharp reversal (high volume down bar) below $290.00.
- **Invalidation:** $299.60 (Current High)
---
### RKT (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** No Supply / Low Volume Down

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the stock had a massive volume thrust (Week 01/05) followed by profit-taking (Weeks 01/12 & 01/19). The monthly context is WATCH_FOR_TEST following a possible Buying Climax. The last weekly bar is a very narrow spread up bar, closing near the middle (CLV: 0.14) on extremely low relative volume (RelVol: 0.22). This suggests selling pressure has momentarily dried up after the shakeout, and supply is currently absent. This pause may precede a new markup, but institutional confirmation is missing.

**Key Levels:** 23.41 (Supply Pivot), 20.67 (Recent Low/Support), 24.36 (Buying Climax High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Long entry on a high volume push above $21.30 (Short-term resistance).
- **Invalidation:** $20.50 (Below major recent swing low)
---
### SPOT (NEUTRAL/BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Test for Supply (Absence Confirmed)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BEARISH, and the weekly sequence is SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (Watch for Test). The last three weeks have seen extreme selling volume (RelVol > 1.3), confirming Smart Money involvement on the sell-side. However, the last weekly bar is a narrow spread down bar (Spread: 9.89) closing near the low (CLV: -0.68), but on very low relative volume (RelVol: 0.40). In the context of confirmed supply dominance, low volume down suggests lack of follow-through and a possible Test of Supply or exhaustion. The extreme low volume compared to the previous weeks is key. Smart Money may be finished distributing for now, leading to a bounce or consolidation.

**Key Levels:** 520.00 (Immediate Resistance/Supply), 510.11 (Support), 500.82 (Major Low Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Long entry above $520.00 (Confirmation of supply absorption).
- **Invalidation:** $510.00 (Breakdown of current support)
---
### STAA (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / End of Selling Pressure

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BEARISH, but the weekly sequence is confirmed STOPPING_VOLUME. Weeks 01/05 and 01/12 showed high volume down moves, indicative of supply entering or a shakeout. The last bar is a narrow spread down bar, closing near the middle/low (CLV: -0.46) on extremely low relative volume (RelVol: 0.38). This low volume suggests that the supply is drying up, and sellers are exhausted, which is typical behavior after stopping volume. However, the close near the low still indicates underlying weakness until demand materializes.

**Key Levels:** 19.66 (Immediate Resistance), 18.81 (Major Support/Stopping Volume Low), 22.68 (Supply Pivot)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Long entry above $19.66 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** $18.80 (Below the recent low)
---
### SYF (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Selling Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly context is BEARISH. The monthly shows a high volume, wide-spread down bar (CLV: -0.89), suggesting a massive shakeout or selling climax (Stopping Volume). The last weekly bar is a wide spread down bar (Spread: 5.46) closing near the low (CLV: -0.67), accompanied by high relative volume (RelVol: 1.08). This heavy selling pressure at the lows, particularly after the monthly wide range down bar, often marks a Selling Climax. Smart Money is aggressively buying into this weakness. The spread and volume combination suggests a violent move that often precedes a reaction/rally.

**Key Levels:** 77.57 (Immediate Resistance), 72.11 (Selling Climax Low Support), 80.19 (Prior Accumulation High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Long entry upon a low volume up bar confirmation or a clean break above $77.57.
- **Invalidation:** $72.00 (Below the climax low)
---
### TRU (NEUTRAL/BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Demand (Confirmed Stopping Volume)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BEARISH, but the monthly sequence is confirmed STOPPING_VOLUME (Sellers exhausted in December/January). The last weekly bar is a wide-spread down bar (Spread: 3.36) closing near the low (CLV: -0.85) on extremely low relative volume (RelVol: 0.25). This is an Effort No Result Down or No Demand/Weak Test, indicating that there is no institutional support (demand) at these levels. Although the monthly suggests a potential reversal area, the weak weekly follow-through suggests the short-term direction is still down due to lack of buying interest.

**Key Levels:** 85.14 (Immediate Resistance), 81.78 (Recent Low/Support), 87.71 (Supply Pivot)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry below $81.78 if volume confirms selling.
- **Invalidation:** $85.14 (High of the test bar)
---
### UNH (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax (Confirmed Supply Dominance)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The overall context is BEARISH, and the weekly sequence is SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (Watch for Test). The last weekly bar is a massive wide-spread down bar (Spread: 74.39) closing near the absolute low (CLV: -0.94) on huge relative volume (RelVol: 1.91). This is a textbook Selling Climax/Climax Down, indicating panic selling and maximum institutional supply. While a climax often precedes a bounce, the sheer size and volume suggest the institutional distribution (Supply Dominance) is overwhelming, and a significant change in character has occurred. The monthly CLV is also extremely low (-0.94). This sets up extreme weakness.

**Key Levels:** 354.79 (Immediate Supply/Resistance), 280.40 (Selling Climax Low), 328.06 (Prior Support Failure)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry after any weak rally/test of supply (e.g., failed rally near $300).
- **Invalidation:** $354.79 (High of the climax bar)
---
### USIG (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** No Demand / Low Volume Down

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the weekly sequence is WATCH_FOR_TEST of SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (indicated by high volume churning weeks 01/05 & 01/12). The last weekly bar is a narrow spread down bar (Spread: 0.12) closing near the low (CLV: -0.83) on very low volume (RelVol: 0.39). This extreme lack of demand on the downside suggests that selling pressure has almost completely dried up. Given the strong rally preceding this consolidation (not shown), this is likely a low-volume shakeout/test area before a potential continuation of the bullish trend, if supply is truly absent.

**Key Levels:** 52.12 (Recent High), 51.99 (Immediate Support), 51.65 (Consolidation Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Long entry above $52.12 on increased volume.
- **Invalidation:** $51.65 (Below the consolidation low)
---
### WMT (NEUTRAL/BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Low Volume Down / Weakness

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the monthly is WATCH_FOR_TEST following a Buying Climax, indicated by the massive volume thrust on 01/12 (RelVol: 5.13) followed by volatility. The last weekly bar is a narrow spread down bar, closing near the middle/low (CLV: -0.14) on very low relative volume (RelVol: 0.38). This low volume in a region where distribution is suspected (after the high volume climax/Upthrust) is a No Demand signal. It suggests institutional buyers are stepping back, and the short-term trend is weak.

**Key Levels:** 121.62 (Buying Climax High), 115.49 (Immediate Support), 117.73 (Prior Close Failure)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry below $115.49 (Break of support) on confirming volume.
- **Invalidation:** $118.85 (High of the current bar)
