## 🚀 Ready for Entry
### ACM (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
The massive sell-off on Feb 9 (RelVol 2.54) was met with immediate absorption as evidenced by the Feb 16 recovery on high volume and a 0.94 CLV. Professionals likely entered on the dip to capture 'bag-holding' supply.

**Key Levels:** 87.56, 98.18, 109.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Confirmed move above 98.20
- **Invalidation:** 87.50
---
### ACWI (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Absorption

**Smart Money Logic:**
High volume on Feb 9 resulted in a shakeout but no follow-through selling. The strong recovery on Feb 16 (CLV 0.97) suggests that smart money is absorbing all available supply near the highs.

**Key Levels:** 148.41, 144.39, 147.63

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** New high above 148.45
- **Invalidation:** 144.30
---
### AEHR (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Test after Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
After a massive volume spike on Feb 9 that failed to close high, the Feb 16 bar shows a successful recovery on low volume. This indicates that supply has dried up after the shakeout, allowing for a potential move higher.

**Key Levels:** 37.49, 26.00, 33.60

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Move above 33.70
- **Invalidation:** 28.50
---
### AGIO (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Test in an Uptrend

**Smart Money Logic:**
A very successful VSA Test. Price pulled back to 26.04 and then closed at the high (CLV 0.97) on very low volume (RelVol 0.49). This shows that supply has been removed and professional sellers are absent.

**Key Levels:** 26.04, 29.28, 29.93

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 29.30
- **Invalidation:** 27.00
---
### ALC (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Absorption

**Smart Money Logic:**
While the market was choppy, ALC steadily climbed on moderate volume with a strong CLV on Feb 16. The high volume on Feb 2 resulted in a small spread, indicating professional absorption of supply.

**Key Levels:** 76.95, 84.40, 78.83

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 84.40
- **Invalidation:** 79.00
---
### AMSC (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result

**Smart Money Logic:**
Strong buying interest on Feb 9 (RelVol 1.88) reversed the supply. Feb 16 shows a minor pullback on average volume. This 'Effort' by buyers is changing the character of the stock toward an uptrend.

**Key Levels:** 24.87, 34.26, 38.10

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Move above 34.30
- **Invalidation:** 32.00
---
### AMZN (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Shakeout

**Smart Money Logic:**
The massive volume on Feb 2 and Feb 9 (RelVol 1.88, 1.61) bottomed near 196. Feb 16 shows a strong bullish recovery with a 0.86 CLV on nearly 1.0 RelVol. This is professional absorption of panic sellers.

**Key Levels:** 196.00, 211.17, 246.35

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 211.50
- **Invalidation:** 196.00
---
### AMZU (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

Correlated with AMZN, this ticker shows professional absorption at the 24.50-25.00 level. Feb 16 shows high CLV (0.86) on rising volume, indicating aggressive entry by buyers.

**Key Levels:** 24.54, 28.37, 39.15

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break of 28.50
- **Invalidation:** 24.50
---
### APH (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Absorption

**Smart Money Logic:**
High volume on Jan 26 was supply, but Feb 16 shows price recovered half of the monthly range with high CLV (0.81 on monthly) and decent weekly strength. Professionals are supporting the stock at the 140 level.

**Key Levels:** 140.00, 151.04, 167.04

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Move above 151.10
- **Invalidation:** 143.00
---
### APLS (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Accumulation

**Smart Money Logic:**
Feb 16 shows a low volume test bar following two weeks of higher closes. This suggests supply has been removed from the market, making it easy for price to continue higher.

**Key Levels:** 21.30, 22.81, 24.10

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 22.85
- **Invalidation:** 21.20
---
### ARMK (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / No Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
Strong momentum. Feb 9 high volume shakeout was ignored, and Feb 16 closed at the high with low volume. This is a classic 'No Supply' test after strength.

**Key Levels:** 38.97, 41.04, 42.94

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break of 41.05
- **Invalidation:** 39.50
---

**Key Levels:** 39.28, 42.76, 37.90

#### Action Plan

- **Invalidation:** 39.20
---
### ATO (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
Extremely strong close (CLV 0.93) on Feb 16. Even though RelVol is lower, the persistence of price at the highs shows no major supply present yet.

**Key Levels:** 177.63, 181.08, 169.82

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Move above 181.10
- **Invalidation:** 177.50
---
### AXTA (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
Price is holding its gains near the highs on very low volume (RelVol 0.46) and small spreads. This confirms that supply is non-existent at these levels.

**Key Levels:** 34.17, 35.72, 33.50

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break of 35.75
- **Invalidation:** 34.10
---
### AXTI (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Absorption after Shakeout

**Smart Money Logic:**
High volume on Feb 2 and Feb 9 was absorbed by strong closings. Feb 16 saw price close high with 0.72 CLV on good volume. Professionals are accumulating this for a breakout.

**Key Levels:** 22.59, 30.80, 16.50

#### Action Plan

- **Invalidation:** 24.40
---
### BAM (BULLISH)

**Key Levels:** 46.76, 53.13, 53.46

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Move above 51.00
- **Invalidation:** 49.40
---
### BBT (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply / Test

**Key Levels:** 30.28, 31.80, 31.95

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 31.85
- **Invalidation:** 30.20
---
### BE (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

### ZM (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply / Absorption

**Smart Money Logic:**
After a 'Buying Climax' signal in late January, the stock has undergone a healthy consolidation. The most recent week (Feb 16) shows a 'No Supply' signature: volume dropped below average (RelVol 0.80) on a narrow spread, and price is holding above the major breakout level from early January. Smart money is not selling into the minor pullback, suggesting they are comfortable with their positions and expecting higher prices.

## 👀 Watch/Monitoring
### ABT (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
The massive supply bar on Jan 19 (RelVol 2.57) has not been absorbed. The subsequent three-week rally occurred on steadily declining volume, which indicates a lack of professional participation in the move higher. The low CLV on Feb 16 confirms that the rally is failing as it approaches overhead resistance.

**Key Levels:** 113.76, 105.27, 112.21

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Price failure to hold 111.00
- **Invalidation:** 114.50
---
### ABVX (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result

**Smart Money Logic:**
Price is rallying strongly on low relative volume (0.50-0.57). While the price action is bullish, the lack of professional volume suggests this might be a 'mark-up' on thin liquidity or a corrective bounce following the supply seen in late January. Professionals are not aggressively buying this breakout.

**Key Levels:** 133.42, 125.00, 111.15

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 133.50 on high volume
- **Invalidation:** 123.90
---
### ACLX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Key Levels:** 71.25, 63.14, 76.50

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 63.00
- **Invalidation:** 68.50

- **Invalidation:** 72.00
---
### ADP (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Aggressive selling with increasing relative volume peaking at 2.10. The latest bar shows an attempt to stabilize but the negative CLV indicates sellers are still in control. No sign of stopping volume yet.

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break of 208.00
- **Invalidation:** 219.00
---
### ADSK (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
The vertical drop is seeing volume deceleration (RelVol down to 0.97). The narrow spread on the last week suggests the selling pressure is exhausting, but we need a 'Test' bar to confirm demand.

**Key Levels:** 216.01, 221.09, 232.21

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Low volume test of 216.00 or high volume breakout of 232.00

---
### AEVA (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Demand

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 12.00
- **Invalidation:** 13.40
---
### AFRM (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 48.50
- **Invalidation:** 53.00
---
### AHR (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**

- **Invalidation:** 53.20

- **Invalidation:** 50.20

### AJG (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

### AKAM (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Upthrust / Supply Overcoming Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break of 93.50
- **Invalidation:** 111.00

### ALAB (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Panic Selling / Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**

- **Invalidation:** 136.00

### ALKT (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

- **Invalidation:** 18.50

- **Invalidation:** 18.68

- **Invalidation:** 84.77

- **Invalidation:** 30.38
---
### MAT (BEARISH)

---
### MCO (NEUTRAL)

---
### ONB (BEARISH)

- **Invalidation:** 51.65
---
### PAGP (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
Volume is high, but the spread is narrowing at the top. While CLV remains high, the 'Buying Climax' signal suggests Smart Money is beginning to offload into the strength.

- **Invalidation:** 21.56
---
### PGY (BEARISH)

- **Invalidation:** 15.51
---
### PLTR (BEARISH)

---
### PYPL (BULLISH)

- **Invalidation:** 54.27
---
### RGTI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Persistent Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
Monthly and weekly sequences show heavy supply dominance. RelVol is drying up, but the low CLV suggests prices will likely drift lower until a stopping volume event.

- **Entry Trigger:** None
- **Invalidation:** 16.74
---
### RKT (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Demand

- **Invalidation:** 18.89
---
### RLI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Demand on Rallies

**Smart Money Logic:**
Price is struggling at the $62-63 level on average volume. Last week's lower close on higher volume suggests selling pressure is returning.

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 60.13
- **Invalidation:** 62.78
---
### RTO (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Distribution

**Smart Money Logic:**
High volume at peaks with narrow closes (CLV -0.69 on Feb 09). The recent bounce on low volume (RelVol 0.84) looks like a trap for bulls.

- **Invalidation:** 32.04
---
### RYAAY (NEUTRAL)

- **Invalidation:** 63.83
---
### RYN (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

- **Invalidation:** 23.79
---
### SATS (BEARISH)

---
### STM (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close above 34.32
- **Invalidation:** 32.14
---
### UGI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

- **Entry Trigger:** None
- **Invalidation:** 39.00
---
### UNH (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Demand on Rally

Classic distribution bar on Jan 26. The current rally is on extremely low RelVol (0.57) and neutral CLV, indicating Smart Money is not buying the bounce.

- **Invalidation:** 95.45

### VNO (BEARISH)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Volume spiked on the Feb 09 drop and the bounce is failing on low volume. No demand from Smart Money at these levels.

**Key Levels:** 33.68, 28.07

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 28.54
- **Invalidation:** 30.14
---
### VONG (BULLISH)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close above 117.50
- **Invalidation:** 113.95
---

**Smart Money Logic:**
Price is falling on low CLV. Rallies are seeing no volume participation (RelVol 0.38). Trend remains firmly with the sellers.

**Key Levels:** 52.00, 34.99

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** None
- **Invalidation:** 41.45
---
### WHR (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
High volume selling in Jan was absorbed by a high CLV bar on Feb 02. However, the last week saw supply return on low CLV. Wait for a re-test.

**Key Levels:** 94.81, 72.55

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Bounce from 80.00
- **Invalidation:** 79.00
---
### WRB (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
RelVol is very low (0.56) on the latest recovery. CLV is neutral (0.09), suggesting this is just a low-volume drift rather than professional accumulation.

**Key Levels:** 73.06, 64.36

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 69.90
- **Invalidation:** 72.06
---
### XYL (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
A massive surge in supply occurred during the week of Feb 09 with ultra-high relative volume (2.46) and a wide price spread. The most recent week (Feb 16) shows a significant decrease in volume and a narrowing spread. While the algo marks this as a 'Watch for Test', the lack of demand following the supply bar suggests smart money is not yet stepping in to support the price, confirming bearish control in line with the quarterly trend.

**Key Levels:** 142.97 (Resistance), 123.98 (Major Support), 128.67 (Immediate Pivot)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Failure to break above 131.35 on low volume (Short) or high volume close above 132.50 (Wait)
- **Invalidation:** 143.00
---
### Z (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Climatic Selling

**Smart Money Logic:**
The ticker experienced extreme climatic selling on Feb 09 with ultra-high volume (RelVol 2.95). The most recent week shows a 'Stopping Volume' characteristic: a significantly narrower spread on still-high volume (RelVol 1.37) and a close off the lows. This indicates professional buying is starting to absorb the panic selling, but because the quarterly trend is bearish, this is likely just a pause or a relief bounce rather than a full reversal.

**Key Levels:** 56.25 (Previous Support turned Resistance), 42.50 (Climatic Low), 47.31 (Recent High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Successful secondary 'Test' of the 42.50 level on low volume
- **Invalidation:** 42.00
