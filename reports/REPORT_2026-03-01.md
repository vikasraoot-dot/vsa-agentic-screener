#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 120.12.
- **Invalidation:** 109.81
---
### NYT (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

Excellent price behavior. After a massive shakeout three weeks ago, NYT has seen rising prices on healthy volume with very high CLVs (0.96). This is clear evidence of smart money absorption and aggressive follow-through demand.

**Key Levels:** 58.86, 79.79

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Market buy at current levels or breakout above 80.
- **Invalidation:** 73.72
---
### PAGP (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
Despite the algorithmic 'Buying Climax' warning, the price action is exceptionally strong. CLVs are consistently near 1.0, and volume is steady. This is more likely 'Absorption of Supply' on a breakout than a trend-ending climax.

**Key Levels:** 20.12, 22.54

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Continue to hold/Add on minor pullbacks.
- **Invalidation:** 21.79
---
### PB (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Confirmed Early Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
Strong accumulation evidence. Following stopping volume, price has stabilized. Last week showed high volume with a strong recovery from the lows (CLV -0.51 is misleading due to high-low range; the quarterly trend is bullish).

**Key Levels:** 65.12, 70.37, 77.19

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 73.85.
- **Invalidation:** 69.26
---
### PEGA (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Long entry on a breakout of 45.40.
- **Invalidation:** 41.40
---
### PFG (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
Price is consolidating after a period of supply. High relative volume (2.22) on a bar that held the mid-range suggests professionals are absorbing supply. Quarterly context is bullish, supporting a continuation higher.

#### Action Plan

- **Invalidation:** 91.76
---
### PHG (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
What looks like a 'Buying Climax' is likely an absorption of supply during a breakout. Price is moving higher on decreasing volume (last week), but closing near the highs. This suggests sellers are exhausted.

**Key Levels:** 28.48, 32.00, 33.43

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 32.16.
- **Invalidation:** 31.07
---
### PLTR (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The detection of 'Supply Dominance' is offset by the massive CLV (0.84) on high relative volume (1.30). This is 'Bag Holding' or 'Professional Support' at the bottom of the range. Smart money is buying the fear.

**Key Levels:** 126.23, 137.19, 165.07

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Long entry at current market price.
- **Invalidation:** 126.37

**Key Levels:** 35.09, 38.97, 39.04

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 39.04.
- **Invalidation:** 36.45
---
### PTGX (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Low Volume Strength

**Smart Money Logic:**
Price surged last week with a near-perfect CLV (0.98) on average volume. This is a sign that supply is completely absent (No Supply). Professionals can move the price up with little effort.

**Key Levels:** 77.00, 92.08

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Market buy on pullbacks.
- **Invalidation:** 82.32
---
### PYPL (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
Massive volume spike (RelVol 2.68) with an up-close. This is a classic 'Change of Behavior.' Smart money has likely completed a major phase of accumulation and is starting to push price higher.

**Key Levels:** 38.45, 46.20, 53.43

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 48.50.
- **Invalidation:** 40.52
---
### RGLD (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Professional Buying

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 300.50.
- **Invalidation:** 281.10
---
### RKT (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Absorption

**Key Levels:** 16.57, 18.19, 21.19

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 18.50.
- **Invalidation:** 16.58
---
### RLI (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
Last week showed a strong recovery (CLV 0.90) on average volume. This is 'No Supply' at the bottom of the current range, suggesting the market is ready for a continuation of its quarterly bullish trend.

**Key Levels:** 58.15, 62.31, 63.61

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 62.44.
- **Invalidation:** 59.88
---
### RTO (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
Confirmed stopping volume with high relative volume (1.84). The price is holding firm and closing in the upper half of the bar (CLV 0.53), suggesting the selling pressure has been neutralized.

**Key Levels:** 30.04, 31.28, 32.77

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Move above 32.00.
- **Invalidation:** 30.22
---

**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

---
### DUOL (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

Massive volume spike (RelVol 4.13) on a wide down spread. While there is a slight lift from the lows, the sheer magnitude of supply suggests Smart Money is dumping into the move. No signs of a stable bottom.

---
### ESTC (BEARISH)

- **Invalidation:** 60.00
---
### FFIN (BEARISH)

### FOXA (NEUTRAL)

---
### FTAI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Distribution at Highs

- **Invalidation:** 324.00

### FTV (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Mixed Signals / Absorption

- **Entry Trigger:** None
- **Invalidation:** 51.00
---

### HUM (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

- **Invalidation:** 18.50

---
### MAT (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
An extreme high volume spike (RelVol 4.07) on 2026-02-09 resulted in a massive price drop. Subsequent weeks show low recovery effort on low spreads. The 'Effort No Result' on the upside confirms that the path of least resistance is down.

---
### MNDY (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Persistent supply is evident as price continues to close near the lows on very high relative volume (RelVol 4.59 during the crash). The narrow spreads of the last two weeks with poor CLVs suggest a lack of professional buying interest despite the lower prices.

- **Invalidation:** 79.68
---
### MSFU (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
Despite the 'Stopping Volume' algorithm detection, the price continues to fail at the highs of the weekly bars. High volume on the move down with negative CLVs suggests that the 'stopping' effort is being overwhelmed by residual supply.

### MTCH (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
High volume on 2026-02-02 failed to sustain higher prices, a classic sign of a Buying Climax where supply is transferred to the public. However, the lack of a sharp follow-through suggests the market is currently in a 'No Demand' phase.

### NET (NEUTRAL)

---
### NTAP (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stopping volume effort has failed to generate a meaningful rally. High volume on the latest bar with a negative CLV (-0.16) suggests that professionals are liquidating into the temporary strength.

### NXPI (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
The early confirmation of stopping volume is supported by the quarterly bullish context. While the recent bar was weak (CLV -0.59), the significant volume increase two weeks ago indicates that large players were accumulating on the dip.

**Key Levels:** 207.00, 227.00, 256.35

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Successful secondary test of 220 level on low volume.
- **Invalidation:** 207.00

- **Invalidation:** 133.50

### OKE (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

### OTIS (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly context is bullish, but the recent weekly data shows a high-volume bar with a mid-close (CLV 0.63). While not entirely bearish, the high relative volume (1.53) suggests a battle between supply and demand is occurring. Need a clear winner.

---
### PAYX (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Key Levels:** 86.88, 93.65, 103.91

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A move above 96 on high volume.

### PGNY (BEARISH)

### PLTU (BEARISH)

Price is consolidating with average volume. The lack of wide spreads and high volume indicates that neither the bulls nor the bears are committed to a move yet.

**Key Levels:** 59.13, 66.00, 70.60

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a volume-backed breakout.
- **Invalidation:** 63.81
---
### PTC (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
Stopping volume is present at the 146 level, but the recovery is anemic on low spreads. This is a market that is waiting for a catalyst rather than showing aggressive VSA strength.

**Key Levels:** 146.72, 156.58, 162.92

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Successful test of 147 level on low volume.
- **Invalidation:** 148.44
---
### QQQI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Market is drifting on negative CLVs and high monthly relative volume. While spreads are narrow, the persistent inability to close at the top of the range indicates a slow drip of supply.

**Key Levels:** 51.69, 52.43, 54.34

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** None.
- **Invalidation:** 53.14
---
### QTWO (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
High volume on down bars with negative CLVs is not stopping volume; it is supply dominance. The 'Effort to Fall' is being rewarded with lower prices.

**Key Levels:** 46.15, 48.11, 62.31

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** None.
- **Invalidation:** 50.55
---
### RARE (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
A quiet week with low relative volume and mid-range close. The market is in equilibrium after a period of supply. Needs a high volume signal to indicate the next direction.

**Key Levels:** 19.60, 23.38, 25.81

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for high volume up-bar.
- **Invalidation:** 22.38
---
### RF (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
A failed breakout followed by a high volume down bar with a very negative CLV (-0.82). This is professional selling into public buyers. The trend has turned bearish.

**Key Levels:** 27.60, 27.82, 31.53

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** None.
- **Invalidation:** 30.16
---
### RGTI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Low Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
The rally attempt is on low relative volume compared to previous selling bars. This indicates a 'Dead Cat Bounce' or a lack of institutional interest at these levels.

**Key Levels:** 14.78, 17.42, 19.20

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short on break of 15.32.
- **Invalidation:** 19.21
---
### RVMD (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
Despite the climax warning, the price is entering new high territory with high relative volume (1.74). While some profit-taking exists (CLV 0.10), the aggressive demand is still clearly pushing through resistance.

**Key Levels:** 93.01, 102.01, 107.44

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Breakout above 107.45.
- **Invalidation:** 95.25
---
### RYAAY (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
Stopping volume is failing here. The relative volume is high, but the price is barely reacting. CLVs remain consistently low/negative, showing that the sellers are still more aggressive than the buyers.

**Key Levels:** 63.83, 67.48, 72.55

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** None.
- **Invalidation:** 69.78
---

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** None.
- **Invalidation:** 22.65
---
### SARO (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
A massive volume spike (RelVol 2.70) resulted in a lower close and a very negative CLV (-0.62). This is high-level distribution.

**Key Levels:** 28.62, 30.79, 33.25

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** None.
- **Invalidation:** 33.25
---
### SSNC (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
Price experienced a heavy sell-off on high relative volume, but the most recent weekly candle shows high CLV (0.79) and high volume, suggesting smart money is beginning to absorb the panicky supply (Bag Holding).

**Key Levels:** 69.00, 77.39, 82.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Successful test on low volume above 70.00
- **Invalidation:** 68.50
---
### STM (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 33.10
- **Invalidation:** 35.10
---
### SUPN (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
Massive spread and volume last week but closed significantly off the highs (CLV 0.01). This is a classic sign of 'hidden supply' where professional money is selling into the retail rush.

**Key Levels:** 59.68, 54.73, 49.63

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Price action failing to reclaim 56.00
- **Invalidation:** 59.70
---
### SYF (BEARISH)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break of 68.20
- **Invalidation:** 72.50
---
### TROW (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Following a wide-spread down bar, recent attempts to rally have very low CLV and are failing to recapture the midpoint of the breakdown bar. Supply is firmly in control.

**Key Levels:** 107.21, 97.67, 91.70

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 92.00
- **Invalidation:** 96.00
---
### TXT (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Test in a Rising Market

- **Invalidation:** 78.00
---
### UGI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
The 'Buying Climax' signal from late January is being followed by weak price action. Professional support is missing as evidenced by the low CLV and declining volume on 'up' attempts.

**Key Levels:** 41.34, 38.76, 36.77

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 36.70
- **Invalidation:** 39.00
---

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short on any low-volume retracement to 29.00
- **Invalidation:** 30.50
---
### VNT (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result

**Smart Money Logic:**
Large volume spike in mid-February resulted in very little price progress, closing mid-range. This suggests supply is neutralizing demand at current levels.

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Clear break of 42.00 on high volume
- **Invalidation:** 39.50
---

- **Entry Trigger:** Break of 113.90
- **Invalidation:** 118.50
---
### WAL (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short below 79.50
- **Invalidation:** 87.00

- **Invalidation:** 42.00

### WTRG (BEARISH)

- **Invalidation:** 40.90

- **Invalidation:** 41.50

- **Invalidation:** 18.60
