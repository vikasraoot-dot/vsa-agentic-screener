## 🚀 Ready for Entry
### BIRK (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Effort vs. Result)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly bar is a wide spread down (6.46) closing near the low (-0.91 CLV) on high relative volume (RelVol 1.85). This confirms strong selling pressure (Supply Dominance) taking control. Despite a rally attempt earlier in the week (high $44.66), sellers pushed the price significantly lower. Quarterly trend is BEARISH, reinforcing the supply strength. Monthly bar also shows extreme weakness.

**Key Levels:** 44.66 (Resistance/Recent High), 38.20 (New Low Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $38.20 or Test/No Demand confirmation near $40.00
- **Invalidation:** Above $44.66 (Recent high)
---
### BKKT (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Accumulation/Reversal Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
Despite the Monthly Sequence showing a recent SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (which often implies a strong downtrend), the last two weekly bars show massive bullish momentum. The last week had a very wide spread up (6.61) closing near the high (0.79 CLV) on very high volume (RelVol 1.21). This constitutes a major Effort (High Volume) leading to a strong Result (High Close, Wide Spread). This signals aggressive Smart Money accumulation and a strong break from the prior selling phase, potentially initiating a new impulse wave up in line with the BULLISH Quarterly Context.

**Key Levels:** 22.11 (Recent High/Immediate Resistance), 15.50 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $22.11 or shallow retracement/No Supply Test near $18.00
- **Invalidation:** Below $15.50 (Recent low)
---
### BKV (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume/Absorption

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Weekly Sequence already detected STOPPING_VOLUME. The last weekly bar shows a narrower spread (1.77) compared to the previous bearish bar (3.17) but closes strongly in the upper half (0.49 CLV) on high volume (RelVol 1.15). This occurred immediately after a prior wide-spread down bar (Week Jan 5) suggesting a successful absorption of supply (Stopping Volume followed by strength). This action marks a potential reversal point aligning with the BULLISH Quarterly Trend.

**Key Levels:** 26.70 (Immediate Resistance), 24.93 (Stopping Volume Low/Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $26.70 (Confirmation of demand) or Test near $25.50
- **Invalidation:** Below $24.93 (Stopping Volume Low)
---
### BRKR (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Up Thrust/Potential Distribution

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly context is STOPPING_VOLUME, implying a potential bottom, but the recent weekly action is concerning. The last weekly bar shows a very wide spread (8.38), indicating high volatility, but the close is poor (-0.87 CLV) on high volume (RelVol 1.21). The price attempted to push significantly higher ($56.22) but was aggressively rejected, closing near the low. This 'Up Thrust' or selling into strength suggests Smart Money distribution or weakness at high levels, counteracting the monthly signal.

**Key Levels:** 56.22 (Up Thrust High/Resistance), 47.84 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $47.84 or No Demand Test confirmation towards $52.00.
- **Invalidation:** Above $56.22
---
### BWA (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax Rejection

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Weekly Sequence is CONFIRMED_STRONG BUYING_CLIMAX. The last bar shows high volume (RelVol 0.96) on a wide spread down (2.07), closing poorly in the lower half (-0.56 CLV). This confirms supply aggressively entering the market following the high volume run-up in previous weeks. The price attempted to rally (Open $47.50) but was quickly rejected. This confirms the climax phase is now turning into distribution/mark-down.

**Key Levels:** 48.80 (Climax High/Resistance), 46.73 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $46.73 (confirmation of weakness) or No Demand test towards $47.50.
- **Invalidation:** Above $48.80 (Climax High)
---
### BWIN (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Demand Persistence

**Smart Money Logic:**
Despite the Quarterly trend being BEARISH and Monthly Sequence being Supply Dominance, the recent price action shows strength. The last weekly bar is a wide spread up (2.35) closing strongly near the high (0.69 CLV) on high volume (RelVol 1.36). This follows a wide spread up bar the week prior. Strong institutional demand is overcoming the existing supply and pushing the price higher, indicating a significant short-term reversal.

**Key Levels:** 27.01 (Immediate Resistance), 24.66 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $27.01 or shallow retracement/No Supply Test towards $25.50.
- **Invalidation:** Below $24.66
---
### CADE (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Demand Persistence

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly Sequence is a Buying Climax, suggesting distribution risk, but the last two weeks have been positive. The last bar shows a wide spread up (2.09) closing strong (0.65 CLV) on high volume (RelVol 1.30). This indicates persistent demand following the strong move on Jan 5 (CLV 0.44, RelVol 0.84). The overall BULLISH Quarterly Trend supports this upward momentum.

**Key Levels:** 44.87 (Immediate Resistance), 42.78 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $44.87 or minor pullback/No Supply Test towards $44.00.
- **Invalidation:** Below $42.78
---
### CALM (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume/Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Weekly Sequence is Supply Dominance, but the latest bar provides a strong counter-signal. It shows a wide spread up (6.07) closing aggressively near the high (0.98 CLV) on very high volume (RelVol 2.07). This is a textbook Stopping Volume bar followed by immediate strong demand, suggesting Smart Money stepped in aggressively at the low of the prior week ($72.52). Despite the BEARISH Quarterly Trend, this short-term move is highly bullish.

**Key Levels:** 77.99 (Immediate Resistance), 71.92 (Stopping Volume Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $77.99 or minor pullback/No Supply Test towards $75.00.
- **Invalidation:** Below $71.92
---
### CBRL (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Demand Persistence (Reversal from Supply)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly Sequence shows Supply Dominance, but the weekly trend is shifting. The last weekly bar shows a wide spread up (7.30) closing well off the high but still strong (0.35 CLV) on high volume (RelVol 1.69). This follows a strong bullish bar the week prior. The high volume confirms demand entering the market, successfully reversing the prior sharp drop. Price is moving strongly back towards the Quarterly BULLISH Trend.

**Key Levels:** 36.89 (Recent High/Resistance), 29.59 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $36.89 or minor pullback/No Supply Test towards $32.00.
- **Invalidation:** Below $29.59
---
### CBSH (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Demand Persistence

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly Sequence is Supply Dominance, but the Quarterly trend is BULLISH. The last weekly bar has a narrow spread (2.26) but closes strongly in the upper half (0.32 CLV) on very high volume (RelVol 1.36). This high volume, following the recent high-volume bullish bar on Jan 5, confirms sustained institutional demand, absorbing supply and continuing the upward push.

**Key Levels:** 55.06 (Immediate Resistance), 52.80 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $55.06 or shallow retracement/No Supply Test towards $53.50.
- **Invalidation:** Below $52.80
---
### CDW (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Persistence

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Weekly Sequence is Supply Dominance. The last weekly bar is a wide spread down (5.65) closing poorly in the lower half (-0.54 CLV) on high volume (RelVol 1.13). This confirms supply dominance is continuing the mark-down phase. Price attempted a rally to $136.09 but was rejected, showing persistent institutional selling pressure.

**Key Levels:** 136.09 (Resistance), 130.44 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $130.44 or No Demand Test near $133.50.
- **Invalidation:** Above $136.09
---
### CMPO (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Demand Persistence (Climax Follow-Through)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Weekly Sequence is Supply Dominance, but the short-term action is bullish. The last bar is a very wide spread up (5.80) closing strongly near the high (0.71 CLV) on extremely high volume (RelVol 3.86). This aggressive move confirms strong institutional demand/accumulation, following the previous week's bullish momentum. This is a powerful sign of reversal in the short term, despite the Quarterly BULLISH Trend being tested by recent supply.

**Key Levels:** 25.95 (Immediate Resistance), 20.15 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $25.95 or shallow retracement/No Supply Test near $24.00.
- **Invalidation:** Below $20.15
---
### CNQ (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Demand Persistence

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Weekly Sequence detected STOPPING_VOLUME. The last weekly bar shows a wide spread up (3.04) closing strongly near the high (0.61 CLV) on very high volume (RelVol 1.54). This follows the massive Stopping Volume bar on Jan 5 (RelVol 2.05). The strong follow-through confirms institutional buying is succeeding in absorbing supply and pushing price higher, aligning with the BULLISH Quarterly Trend.

**Key Levels:** 34.95 (Immediate Resistance), 31.91 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $34.95 or shallow retracement/No Supply Test towards $33.50.
- **Invalidation:** Below $31.91
---
### CNXC (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result Down (Absorption)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Weekly Sequence detected STOPPING_VOLUME. The last weekly bar shows a very wide spread (6.02) closing strongly in the upper half (0.76 CLV) on extremely high volume (RelVol 2.18). This high volume on a bar that moved significantly higher from the low ($37.85) suggests massive absorption of supply by Smart Money, confirming the demand previously signaled. Price is moving back toward the BULLISH Quarterly Trend structure.

**Key Levels:** 43.87 (Immediate Resistance), 37.85 (Stopping Volume Low/Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $43.87 or Test/No Supply confirmation near $41.00.
- **Invalidation:** Below $37.85
---
### COST (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Demand Persistence (Reversal from Supply)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Weekly Sequence detected CONFIRMED_EARLY Supply Dominance, indicating a prior period of weakness. The last weekly bar shows an extremely wide spread up (47.98) closing very strong near the high (0.94 CLV) on high volume (RelVol 1.44). This is a powerful display of institutional demand, confirming a complete reversal of the previous supply-dominated phase. Price is now aggressively trending higher, aligning with the BULLISH Quarterly Trend.

**Key Levels:** 964.98 (New High/Resistance), 917.00 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $964.98 or shallow retracement/No Supply Test towards $940.00.
- **Invalidation:** Below $917.00

### CSGP (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume/Absorption

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Weekly Sequence is Supply Dominance, but the latest bar is a powerful reversal signal. It shows a very wide spread up (8.92) closing extremely strongly near the high (0.87 CLV) on massive volume (RelVol 2.51). This follows a catastrophic Selling Climax bar (Jan 5). This is textbook Stopping Volume followed by immediate strength, confirming massive institutional absorption of supply, potentially initiating a shift away from the BEARISH Quarterly Trend.

**Key Levels:** 65.93 (Immediate Resistance), 57.01 (Stopping Volume Low/Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $65.93 or shallow retracement/No Supply Test towards $62.00.
- **Invalidation:** Below $57.01
---
### DOW (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Demand Persistence

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly Sequence is confirmed Supply Dominance, but the weekly structure is strongly bullish, attempting a trend reversal. The last bar has a wide spread up (2.45) closing strongly (0.22 CLV) on high volume (RelVol 1.22). While the CLV isn't perfect, the persistence of the upward move on high volume, following a prior strong bar (Jan 5, CLV 0.86), signals strong institutional demand returning, aligning with the BULLISH Quarterly Trend.

**Key Levels:** 28.52 (New High/Resistance), 26.07 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $28.52 or minor pullback/No Supply Test towards $27.00.
- **Invalidation:** Below $26.07
---
### FER (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Demand Persistence (Reversal from Stopping Volume)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Weekly Sequence is CONFIRMED_STRONG STOPPING_VOLUME. The last weekly bar is a wide spread up (1.93) closing strongly near the high (0.66 CLV) on very high volume (RelVol 1.19). This is strong confirmation of demand following the major stopping action in December. Smart Money is absorbing supply and pushing the price higher. This is a clear demand signal.

**Key Levels:** 68.54 (Immediate Resistance/New High), 66.61 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $68.54 or shallow retracement/No Supply Test towards $67.50.
- **Invalidation:** Below $66.61
---
### FFIN (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Demand Persistence

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Weekly Sequence is Supply Dominance, but the short-term action is bullish, aligning with the BULLISH Quarterly Trend. The last bar is a wide spread up (1.82) closing strongly in the upper half (0.53 CLV) on high volume (RelVol 1.29). This follows a strong accumulation bar on Jan 5, confirming persistent institutional demand that is overcoming the supply pressure previously dominating the weekly chart.

**Key Levels:** 32.97 (New High/Resistance), 31.15 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $32.97 or shallow retracement/No Supply Test towards $32.00.
- **Invalidation:** Below $31.15
---
### FIBK (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Demand Persistence (Absorption)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly Sequence is a confirmed Buying Climax, suggesting distribution risk. However, the last weekly bar is a wide spread (1.59) closing strongly in the upper half (0.11 CLV) on high volume (RelVol 1.27). While the CLV is mediocre, the high volume suggests demand absorbed selling pressure encountered during the week, maintaining the upward trajectory following the strong rally on Jan 5. Price is consolidating demand near the highs.

**Key Levels:** 37.56 (Immediate Resistance), 35.97 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $37.56 or shallow retracement/No Supply Test towards $36.50.
- **Invalidation:** Below $35.97
---
### FNF (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume/Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Weekly Sequence detected STOPPING_VOLUME. The last bar shows a wide spread (3.75) closing strongly in the upper third (0.09 CLV) on very high volume (RelVol 1.81). Price dropped significantly to $50.82 before being bought back up. This strong recovery on high volume confirms Smart Money accumulation (Stopping Volume) near the low, suggesting the supply exhaustion is beginning. Despite the BEARISH Quarterly Trend, this is a powerful reversal signal.

**Key Levels:** 54.57 (Immediate Resistance), 50.82 (Stopping Volume Low/Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $54.57 or shallow retracement/No Supply Test towards $52.00.
- **Invalidation:** Below $50.82
---
### FRPT (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Demand Persistence

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly Sequence is CONFIRMED_EARLY STOPPING_VOLUME. The last weekly bar shows a wide spread (4.42) closing strongly in the upper half (0.48 CLV) on below-average volume (RelVol 0.77). This confirms persistent demand following the strong reversal on Jan 5 (CLV 0.97). Demand is absorbing remaining supply efficiently and maintaining the push higher, aligning with the BULLISH Quarterly Trend.

**Key Levels:** 65.40 (Immediate Resistance), 60.97 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $65.40 or shallow retracement/No Supply Test towards $63.00.
- **Invalidation:** Below $60.97
---
### GBCI (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Demand Persistence

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly Sequence is confirmed Supply Dominance, but the weekly action is strongly bullish, signaling a reversal against that weakness. The last bar is a wide spread up (2.95) closing strongly in the upper half (0.30 CLV) on high volume (RelVol 1.22). This follows a strong accumulation bar on Jan 5. This confirms institutional demand is overcoming the supply and continuing the advance, aligning with the BULLISH Quarterly Trend.

**Key Levels:** 48.89 (New High/Resistance), 45.94 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $48.89 or shallow retracement/No Supply Test towards $47.00.
- **Invalidation:** Below $45.94
---
### GNTX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly sequence indicates confirmed SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The last weekly bar (Jan 12) is a wide spread down bar closing near the low (CLV -0.01) on very high volume (RelVol 1.43). This combination (Wide Spread Down, High Volume, Low Close) confirms aggressive selling pressure, likely driven by smart money distribution, overcoming the previous weekly rally attempt (Jan 05, high CLV, high volume).

**Key Levels:** 24.53 (Recent High Resistance), 23.35 (Low Support), 23.00 (Psychological Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and sustain below 23.90 (minor support/retest area).
- **Invalidation:** 24.53 (Recent high)
---
### GWRE (STRONG BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Weakness Confirmed

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly bar (Jan 12) is an extremely wide spread down bar, closing at the absolute low (CLV -0.98), on exceptionally high volume (RelVol 2.35). This is a definitive sign of panic selling and massive professional distribution. This confirms the previously detected SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The Quarterly Context is BEARISH, amplifying the significance of this move.

**Key Levels:** 187.50 (Recent Breakdown Level), 158.80 (New Low Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Retest of the breakdown area (near 165-170) or confirmation of failure below 158.80.
- **Invalidation:** 187.63 (If the price recovers significantly above the prior weekly close)
---
### HPE (STRONG BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Failed Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly context indicates STOPPING_VOLUME (CONFIRMED_EARLY), suggesting potential bottom formation. However, the last weekly bar (Jan 12) is a wide spread down bar, closing near the low (CLV -0.96) on high volume (RelVol 0.60). This move breaks through the prior low (21.76), negating the initial Stopping Volume signal (from Jan 05) and confirming weakness. This is a severe failure to test, indicating the underlying downtrend is accelerating.

**Key Levels:** 21.42 (New Low Support), 21.76 (Breakdown Level), 24.00 (Overhead Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 21.42 (confirming new leg down).
- **Invalidation:** 22.71 (If price reverses and closes strongly above this minor resistance)
---
### HRMY (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly sequence shows SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The last weekly bar (Jan 12) is a wide spread down bar, closing negatively (CLV -0.34) on high volume (RelVol 1.18). This occurred after the previous week's bar (Jan 05) was a wide spread up bar closing high (CLV 0.87) on high volume, suggesting strong effort. The subsequent reversal down on Jan 12 indicates that the buyers' effort was immediately absorbed by waiting supply. This is a classic Effort No Result leading to immediate weakness.

**Key Levels:** 39.40 (Recent High Resistance), 34.68 (Low Support), 37.18 (Prior Open Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 36.20 (last close) with volume confirmation.
- **Invalidation:** 39.40 (Failure of supply at the high)
---
### IMAX (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly context indicates STOPPING_VOLUME (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The last weekly bar (Jan 12) is highly bullish: a wide spread up bar closing near the high (CLV 0.90) on very high volume (RelVol 1.42). This action effectively absorbs prior selling (from Jan 05 down bar on high volume). This is textbook Stopping Volume followed by a strong reversal, indicating that smart money has entered and absorbed significant supply.

**Key Levels:** 37.61 (Recent High Resistance), 33.30 (Stopping Volume Low), 37.00 (Prior Resistance turn to Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry on a successful 'Test' of the last week's close or a break above 38.00.
- **Invalidation:** 33.61 (Low of the Stopping Volume bar)
---
### INVH (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume Confirmed

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence shows STOPPING_VOLUME (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The last bar (Jan 12) is an up bar closing at the high (CLV 0.98) on high volume (RelVol 1.45). This powerful reversal occurs immediately after the previous week's wide down spread on high volume (Jan 05, RelVol 2.56, CLV -0.20), suggesting that the smart money buying absorbed the panic selling. The bullish close confirms the presence of demand and potentially completes the initial absorption phase.

**Key Levels:** 28.34 (Recent High Resistance), 25.97 (Low of Stopping Volume), 27.00 (Minor Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry on a test/minor pullback toward 27.00, or confirmed break above 28.00.
- **Invalidation:** 25.97 (If price fails below the low of the demand zone)
---
### JKS (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence shows BUYING_CLIMAX (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The last bar (Jan 12) is a wide spread up bar closing neutrally (CLV 0.08) on very high volume (RelVol 1.83). A very wide spread bar with a neutral/low close on high volume is a key VSA signal for a buying climax or an upthrust, where smart money sells into the demand. This strong effort yielded no proportional result, confirming the climax warning.

**Key Levels:** 30.90 (Climax High), 28.00 (Prior Resistance), 27.84 (Low of Climax Bar)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 29.50 (current close) or a No Demand bar near the high.
- **Invalidation:** 30.90 (If price closes strongly above this high)
---
### JPM (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Distribution

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence indicates SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The last weekly bar (Jan 12) is a massive wide spread down bar, closing near the low (CLV -0.38) on extremely high volume (RelVol 2.23). This volume level suggests panic selling or professional distribution. This violent down move, breaking recent support (323.14), confirms that smart money supply has aggressively entered the market, overpowering prior demand attempts.

**Key Levels:** 326.86 (Immediate Resistance), 312.47 (New Close/Minor Support), 306.12 (Low Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Confirmation of weakness below 312.47 or a weak retest of 320.00.
- **Invalidation:** 326.86 (If price recovers significantly above the body of the down bar)
---
### KN (BEARISH (Short-Term Pressure))
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence confirms SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The last weekly bar (Jan 12) is a wide spread up bar, but the close is middling (CLV 0.43) despite the high volume (RelVol 1.15). This action, after breaking out above the prior weeks' range, suggests that buying effort met with immediate and significant supply near the high (25.23). This is a strong Effort No Result signal, suggesting that the breakout failed to gain traction.

**Key Levels:** 25.24 (High Resistance/Failed Breakout), 24.58 (Current Close), 23.02 (Initial Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 24.50, confirming the failure of the move.
- **Invalidation:** 25.24 (If price sustains above the high of the climax bar)
---
### KVYO (STRONG BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Weakness Confirmed

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly and monthly sequences show STOPPING_VOLUME (WATCH_FOR_TEST), but the last weekly bar (Jan 12) is a wide spread down bar, closing near the absolute low (CLV -0.96) on high volume (RelVol 1.31). This move definitively breaks the prior support zone (27.26), confirming the dominance of supply and overwhelming any potential stopping volume from earlier weeks. This suggests a major markdown phase is underway.

**Key Levels:** 28.57 (Prior Support Level), 23.74 (New Low Support), 28.00 (Breakdown Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Retest of 25.00/26.00 or break below 23.74.
- **Invalidation:** 28.65 (If price recovers above the high of the down bar)
---
### LHX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Upthrust

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence signals BUYING_CLIMAX (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The last weekly bar (Jan 12) is an extremely wide spread bar closing weakly (CLV -0.05) on massive, high volume (RelVol 2.32). This is a classic Upthrust/Buying Climax. The enormous volume indicates heavy professional activity, but the weak close suggests this activity was distribution (selling) into strong but naive retail demand. The extreme volatility is a warning sign at the top of a BULLISH Quarterly Trend.

**Key Levels:** 361.59 (Climax High), 346.46 (Current Close), 332.88 (Low Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 340.00 or a clear No Demand signal near the high.
- **Invalidation:** 361.59 (If price closes strongly above this high)
---
### LQDA (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result (Supply Confirmation)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly sequence confirms SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The last weekly bar (Jan 12) is a very wide spread up bar, yet it closed poorly (CLV -0.01) on high volume (RelVol 1.53). This is 'Effort No Result'—buyers made a huge push on high volume, but the close was near the open/low, indicating strong supply absorbed the movement, confirming the monthly weakness signaled by smart money.

**Key Levels:** 41.57 (High Resistance), 37.93 (Current Close), 37.00 (Initial Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 37.00 (confirming rejection from 41.57) or a No Demand bar.
- **Invalidation:** 41.57 (If price closes strongly above this high)
---
### MAN (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result (Supply Confirmation)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly sequence confirms SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The last weekly bar (Jan 12) is a wide spread down bar, closing negatively (CLV -0.39) on slightly high volume (RelVol 1.00). This bar occurred immediately after the prior week's strong rally (Jan 05: wide spread up, high CLV, RelVol 0.89). The swift reversal down suggests the previous effort failed, and supply has returned to drive prices lower. This weakness confirms the underlying monthly supply dominance.

**Key Levels:** 31.75 (High Resistance), 30.07 (Current Close), 29.40 (Low Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 30.00 (confirming rejection).
- **Invalidation:** 31.75 (If demand overcomes the recent high)
---
### MNDY (STRONG BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Weakness Confirmed

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence indicates SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The last weekly bar (Jan 12) is an extremely wide spread down bar, closing near the low (CLV -0.97) on very high volume (RelVol 1.90). This massive move down confirms the heavy distribution detected in December and breaches critical support levels (142.08, 126.41). This is extreme weakness/capitulation, confirming aggressive selling by smart money.

**Key Levels:** 148.03 (Immediate Resistance), 126.41 (New Low Support), 142.08 (Breakdown Level)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Confirmation of break below 126.41 or a failed retest of 135.00.
- **Invalidation:** 147.39 (If price recovers significantly above the body of the down bar)
---
### MSFU (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Weakness Confirmed

**Smart Money Logic:**
Both weekly and monthly sequences indicate SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The last weekly bar (Jan 12) is a wide spread down bar, closing near the low (CLV -0.72) on extremely high volume (RelVol 1.99). This definitive selling pressure breaks the recent range lows (39.04), confirming the strength of the supply side and suggesting that the smart money is aggressively distributing the stock.

**Key Levels:** 40.85 (Immediate Resistance), 39.04 (Breakdown Level), 36.67 (New Low Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 36.67 or a weak retest of the breakdown area (near 39.00).
- **Invalidation:** 40.85 (If price manages a strong close above this high)
---
### NFXL (STRONG BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Weakness Confirmed

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence signals SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The last weekly bar (Jan 12) is a wide spread down bar, closing near the low (CLV -0.88) on high volume (RelVol 2.15). This continued pattern of wide down spreads and negative closes, especially the high relative volume, confirms aggressive selling and the acceleration of the markdown phase. The prior week's low (27.05) was taken out forcefully.

**Key Levels:** 29.08 (Immediate Resistance), 27.05 (Prior Low Resistance), 26.69 (New Low Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 26.69, confirming further markdown.
- **Invalidation:** 29.80 (If price recovers above the high of the previous weak bar)
---
### NICE (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Weakness

**Smart Money Logic:**
Both weekly and monthly sequences indicate SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The last weekly bar (Jan 12) is a wide spread down bar, closing negatively (CLV -0.36) on very high volume (RelVol 1.83). This sharp down move immediately follows a strong rally attempt (Jan 05: wide spread up, high CLV, RelVol 0.80). The violent reversal on high volume suggests professional selling absorbed the recent demand, confirming the dominance of supply.

**Key Levels:** 118.37 (High Resistance), 109.30 (Low Support), 112.18 (Current Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 111.00 or a failure to sustain a rally above 115.00.
- **Invalidation:** 118.37 (If demand can clear the high of the resistance zone)
---
### OC (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Successful Follow-Through)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly sequence shows STOPPING_VOLUME (CONFIRMED_EARLY). The last two weekly bars are highly bullish. Jan 05 was a wide spread up bar, closing near the high (CLV 0.96) on high volume. The last bar (Jan 12) is a continuation up bar, also wide spread, closing high (CLV 0.46) on high volume (RelVol 1.07). This confirms the presence of professional demand driving prices higher following the prior stopping action, suggesting successful accumulation.

**Key Levels:** 126.08 (High Resistance), 121.30 (Immediate Support), 117.00 (Prior Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry on a test/pullback to 124.00 or a break above 126.08.
- **Invalidation:** 120.39 (If selling overcomes the low of the demand bar)
---
### OKLO (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Weakness / Effort No Result

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly context confirms BUYING_CLIMAX. The last weekly bar (Jan 12) is a very wide spread down bar, closing negatively (CLV -0.38) on high volume (RelVol 0.93). This reversal follows the massive wide spread up bar (Jan 05: RelVol 1.18) which was likely the climax bar itself. The failure of the price to sustain its gains and the immediate strong reversal down indicate heavy distribution and lack of demand follow-through after the climax move.

**Key Levels:** 107.60 (Immediate Resistance), 89.30 (Low Support), 94.95 (Current Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 90.00, confirming the reversal.
- **Invalidation:** 107.60 (If price recovers and holds above the resistance zone)
---
### PAYX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Weakness Confirmed

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence confirms SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The last weekly bar (Jan 12) is a wide spread down bar, closing negatively (CLV -0.10) on high volume (RelVol 1.04). This bar confirms the selling pressure seen in late December (Dec 29 down bar on high volume). The effort from buyers last week (Jan 05: wide spread up, high CLV, RelVol 0.97) failed immediately, indicating supply remains dominant at the top of the range (Effort No Result to the upside).

**Key Levels:** 113.99 (Immediate Resistance), 108.91 (Low Support), 111.18 (Current Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 110.90 (confirming continuation of weakness).

The weekly sequence indicates SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The last weekly bar (Jan 12) is an extremely wide spread down bar, closing near the low (CLV -0.81) on high volume (RelVol 2.02). This move definitively breaks the established range and confirms the aggressive presence of supply, likely fueled by professional distribution. This is a major sign of weakness accelerating the markdown phase.

**Key Levels:** 121.99 (Immediate Resistance), 105.10 (New Low Support), 115.18 (Prior Support Breakdown)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Confirmation of break below 105.10 or weak rally retesting 110.00.
- **Invalidation:** 121.99 (If price aggressively recovers above this high)
---

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly sequence confirms SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The last weekly bar (Jan 12) is a wide spread down bar, closing near the low (CLV -0.93) on high volume (RelVol 1.07). This move immediately follows a strong bullish bar (Jan 05: wide spread up, high CLV, RelVol 0.85). The immediate and violent reversal down indicates that the prior demand effort failed and was quickly overwhelmed by supply (Effort No Result), confirming the underlying bearish structure.

**Key Levels:** 25.43 (Immediate Resistance), 21.87 (New Low Support), 22.50 (Prior Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 21.87 confirming continuation.

---
### PSN (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort to Rise (Continuation)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly context shows SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (WATCH_FOR_TEST), suggesting bottoming efforts. The last two weekly bars are strong up moves. Jan 05 was a wide spread up bar closing high (CLV 0.97) on high volume, indicating demand. The current bar (Jan 12) is a continuation up bar, closing very high (CLV 0.82) on above-average volume (RelVol 0.84). This sustained buying confirms that demand is present and capable of overriding the monthly supply pressure, suggesting a phase of recovery.

**Key Levels:** 72.81 (New High Resistance), 70.02 (Immediate Support), 68.85 (Demand Zone Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Test/pullback to 70.00 area (No Supply) or break above 72.81.

---
### QTWO (STRONG BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Weakness Confirmed

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly sequence confirms SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The last weekly bar (Jan 12) is a wide spread down bar, closing near the absolute low (CLV -0.92) on high volume (RelVol 0.57). This continues the negative momentum from the previous week's down bar (Dec 29, CLV -0.81). The price has broken below multiple previous supports, indicating that smart money is aggressively selling, confirming the markdown phase in this BEARISH quarterly trend.

**Key Levels:** 68.89 (Immediate Resistance), 64.87 (New Low Support), 69.43 (Breakdown Level)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Confirmation of break below 64.87 or weak retest of 68.00.

### RARE (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Weakness Confirmed

**Smart Money Logic:**
Both weekly and monthly sequences indicate SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The last weekly bar (Jan 12) is a wide spread down bar, closing near the low (CLV -0.91) on high volume (RelVol 1.62). This follows a sharp rally/retest (Dec 29 up bar on huge volume, followed by Jan 05 down bar). The current bar confirms the failure of the prior demand surge and indicates supply has returned to forcefully drive the price lower, continuing the markdown phase.

**Key Levels:** 24.65 (Immediate Resistance), 22.40 (New Low Support), 23.60 (Prior Close Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 22.40 or a weak rally back to 23.00.

### RF (BEARISH)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly sequence confirms SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The last weekly bar (Jan 12) is a wide spread down bar, closing negatively (CLV -0.32) on extremely high volume (RelVol 1.13). This strong selling pressure follows the high volume rally (Jan 05: wide spread up, high CLV, RelVol 0.75). The immediate reversal down on heavier volume confirms that supply is present and active, effectively absorbing the previous demand. This is Effort No Result to the upside, confirming bearish pressure.

**Key Levels:** 28.61 (High Resistance), 27.34 (Low Support), 28.52 (Prior Close Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 27.50.

**VSA Status:** Effort No Result (Weakness)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly sequence indicates SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The last weekly bar (Jan 12) is a wide spread up bar, closing negatively (CLV -0.15) on extremely high volume (RelVol 1.27). This is a classic Upthrust action following the previous wide spread up bar (Jan 05: high CLV, RelVol 1.30). The enormous volume failed to push the price decisively, indicating that smart money supplied the market heavily at 24.36, capping the rally and confirming underlying weakness.

**Key Levels:** 24.36 (Upthrust High Resistance), 22.42 (Low Support), 23.24 (Current Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 22.80 (confirming weakness after the high volume reversal).
- **Invalidation:** 24.36 (If price closes strongly above the Upthrust high)
---
### RLI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Weakness Confirmed

**Smart Money Logic:**
Both weekly and monthly sequences indicate BUYING_CLIMAX (WATCH_FOR_TEST), which often leads to major trend reversals down (Supply Dominance). The last weekly bar (Jan 12) is an up bar closing near the open/low (CLV -0.008) on high volume (RelVol 1.12). This is a strong indicator of supply returning (Effort No Result). Buyers attempted a modest rally but were immediately overwhelmed by selling pressure, driving the price down from the high. This confirms that the recent bullish momentum is failing.

**Key Levels:** 60.52 (Immediate Resistance), 58.20 (New Low Support), 59.35 (Current Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 59.00 with volume confirmation.
- **Invalidation:** 60.52 (If price decisively overcomes the high of the supply bar)
---
### RVMD (BEARISH (Distribution Warning))
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Upthrust

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence indicates BUYING_CLIMAX (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The Jan 05 bar was a massive wide spread up bar on huge volume (RelVol 4.20), signaling a potential climax. The last bar (Jan 12) is a wide spread up bar, but the close is middling (CLV 0.24) on high volume (RelVol 1.90). The failure to sustain the price at the high (124.49) despite high volume, immediately following the climax, confirms strong professional distribution (Upthrust).

**Key Levels:** 124.49 (Climax High), 116.82 (Immediate Support), 113.33 (Low Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 118.00 or a clear No Demand test near the high.
- **Invalidation:** 124.49 (If price closes strongly above this high)
---
### SATS (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Upthrust

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence indicates BUYING_CLIMAX (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The last weekly bar (Jan 12) is an extremely wide spread bar, but the close is negative (CLV -0.63) on extremely high volume (RelVol 1.96). This is a severe Upthrust/Buying Climax. The huge effort (volume) failed to produce a sustained high close, indicating smart money was selling aggressively into the climax surge. This suggests a significant reversal is likely imminent.

**Key Levels:** 132.25 (Climax High), 121.29 (Low Support), 123.27 (Current Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 121.29, confirming immediate weakness.
- **Invalidation:** 132.25 (If price closes strongly above the high of the climax bar)
---
### SPOT (STRONG BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Weakness Confirmed

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence signals SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The last weekly bar (Jan 12) is a wide spread down bar, closing near the absolute low (CLV -0.84) on very high volume (RelVol 2.30). This violent selling confirms the severe markdown detected last week (Jan 05: wide spread down, huge volume, CLV -0.91). This confirms the acceleration of the distribution phase, breaking critical support and indicating panic selling/aggressive smart money shorts.

**Key Levels:** 548.55 (Immediate Resistance), 500.82 (New Low Support), 539.37 (Prior Support Breakdown)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Confirmation of break below 500.82 or a weak retest of 520.00.
- **Invalidation:** 548.55 (If demand manages a significant recovery above the high)
---
### STT (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Despite a bullish quarterly trend, the last weekly bar (2026-01-12) is a strong bearish signal: very High Volume (RelVol 1.81), wide spread, and close near the absolute low (CLV -0.98). This suggests Smart Money distribution or intense selling pressure overcoming demand, confirming the Supply Dominance flag. This is a significant reversal effort.

**Key Levels:** Support: 126.19 (Prior consolidation low), Resistance: 137.05 (Recent high), Key Pivot: 131.40

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 128.00 (last close) or failure to rally back above 132.00 on weak volume (Test for Supply).
- **Invalidation:** 137.05 (New high above recent high, negating the distribution effort)
---
### TFX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
TFX is in a bearish quarterly trend. The last weekly bar (2026-01-12) confirmed the supply pressure with High Volume (RelVol 1.81), wide spread, and a close near the absolute low (CLV -0.93), indicating continuation of selling. The previous week was also heavy supply (CLV -0.53, RelVol 1.97). This strong downside pressure confirms bearish momentum.

**Key Levels:** Support: 102.68 (Recent low), Resistance: 112.80 (Previous support/new resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 102.68 (recent low) or a weak rally back towards 108.00 showing weak demand (Test for Supply).
- **Invalidation:** 113.00 (A move above last week's open/previous resistance)
---
### TRU (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Confirmed Strong - Monthly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
While the weekly chart shows internal consolidation, the Monthly chart shows a strong Stopping Volume confirmed in January 2026. The weekly bar (2026-01-12) shows moderate volume (RelVol 0.64) but a strong close in the upper half (CLV 0.66), suggesting demand is entering the market after the shakeout in late December. The bullish quarterly context supports continued strength.

**Key Levels:** Support: 82.58 (Last weekly low), Resistance: 89.12 (Recent high)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Breakout above 87.80 with confirming volume, targeting 89.12 then higher.
- **Invalidation:** 82.50 (Violation of the last significant weekly low)
---
### VONG (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
VONG is bearish quarterly. The last weekly bar (2026-01-12) shows extreme volume (RelVol 2.81), a wide spread, and a weak close (CLV -0.32). This is a strong Supply Dominance signal, confirming selling pressure is accelerating, likely testing the Selling Climax low from December 2025 (Monthly flag).

**Key Levels:** Support: 120.03 (Last weekly low), Resistance: 123.18 (Last weekly high)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 120.03 on follow-through volume, targeting a test of the 118 level.
- **Invalidation:** 123.59 (Above previous high, invalidating the supply effort)
---
### WFC (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Despite the bullish quarterly trend, the weekly chart shows aggressive distribution/Supply Dominance. The last bar (2026-01-12) is a massive down bar on extreme volume (RelVol 1.96), wide spread, and a close near the low (CLV -0.91). This is a significant reversal signal, wiping out gains since early December. Smart Money is aggressively selling.

**Key Levels:** Support: 88.06 (SD Low), Resistance: 93.00 (Prior pivot/resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Immediate downside follow-through, or a weak No Demand rally back towards 93.00.
- **Invalidation:** 95.95 (A close above the prior week's close, negating the large down bar)
---
### WMG (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Confirmed Strong)

**Smart Money Logic:**
WMG has confirmed a strong Buying Climax. The current week (2026-01-12) shows high volume (RelVol 1.02), a medium spread, and a close near the low (CLV -0.64). This reversal action, immediately following the aggressive push higher in the previous weeks, confirms that Smart Money is distributing. The inability to hold gains on high volume is a key reversal indication.

**Key Levels:** Support: 30.37 (Last weekly low), Resistance: 31.62 (BC high)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 30.37 on follow-through volume.
- **Invalidation:** 31.62 (A move above the high of the climax bar)
---
### WRB (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Watch for Test - Monthly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
WRB is in a quarterly bearish trend and showing monthly supply pressure. The last two weekly bars (2026-01-05 and 2026-01-12) both show strong evidence of supply, with moderate to high volume (RelVol 0.97, 1.00) and closes deep in the lower half (CLV -0.73, -0.71). This sequential weakness on downside spread confirms that supply is pushing the price down, likely testing the critical support established by the monthly Supply Dominance.

**Key Levels:** Support: 67.57 (Last weekly low), Resistance: 69.41 (Prior support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 67.57 with volume follow-through, confirming markdown phase.
- **Invalidation:** 69.78 (Violation of the current week's high)
---
### ZBH (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
ZBH is in a quarterly bearish trend. The last weekly bar (2026-01-12) showed high volume (RelVol 1.95), a wide spread, and closed near the low (CLV -0.60). This is a strong Supply Dominance signal, confirming that the short-term rally from the start of January has failed, and selling pressure is resuming aggressively, consistent with the bearish quarterly context.

**Key Levels:** Support: 85.76 (SD low), Resistance: 92.85 (Prior pivot)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 85.76 on confirming volume, or a weak No Demand rally toward 90.00.
- **Invalidation:** 93.62 (A move above the high of the SD bar)
---
## 👀 Watch/Monitoring
### BHF (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax Test (CLV -0.46)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly context is a recent Buying Climax, indicating potential reversal from a bullish run. The last weekly bar shows a wide spread down (0.89) closing poorly (-0.46 CLV) on above average volume (RelVol 0.74). This suggests strong supply pressure stepping in to test the prior month's Buying Climax area. The volume is high enough to show interest but the close is poor, meaning buyers did not manage to absorb all the selling efficiently at the low.

**Key Levels:** 65.64 (Monthly High), 63.80 (Recent Low Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for No Supply confirmation near $63.80 or strong reversal (Up Thrust Rejection/Low Volume Close Up)
- **Invalidation:** Below $63.79 (Recent low)
---
### BKSY (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Potential Profit Taking/Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly context is a confirmed Buying Climax, suggesting distribution risk. The last weekly bar shows a wide spread up (5.55) closing mid-range (0.19 CLV) on above-average volume (RelVol 1.08). The high volume accompanying a less-than-perfect close after a large run-up (High $29.79) could indicate profit taking or resistance meeting the effort. The bar is still up, maintaining the short-term bullish tone, but the weak close suggests selling pressure is present at the highs.

**Key Levels:** 29.79 (Buying Climax High), 24.24 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for strong bearish bar (Up Thrust/Reversal) confirmation below $27.00.
- **Invalidation:** Break above $29.79
---
### BL (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Climax)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Weekly Sequence shows Supply Dominance, reinforced by the last bar. It features a very wide spread down (7.40) closing near the absolute low (-0.51 CLV) on extremely high volume (RelVol 2.04). This is a strong sign of selling climax, indicating panic or aggressive institutional selling, continuing the BEARISH Quarterly Trend. While a climax suggests a potential reaction rally soon, the immediate pressure is overwhelmingly bearish.

**Key Levels:** 58.25 (Immediate Resistance), 50.85 (Selling Climax Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a clean No Demand bar or rally test failure towards $55.00 before shorting. Alternatively, wait for confirmation of a short-term bottom (Stopping Volume).
- **Invalidation:** Above $56.70 (Mid-range prior bar)
---
### BND (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Effort No Result Down)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Weekly Sequence is Supply Dominance. The last weekly bar is a wide spread (0.31) down, closing poorly (-0.74 CLV) on very high volume (RelVol 1.88). Despite high volume effort to push price lower, the spread is relatively narrow compared to the extreme volume, suggesting aggressive buying is meeting the selling pressure at the low (Stopping action). The close is poor, keeping the immediate tone bearish, but the reaction on extreme volume hints at potential support building.

**Key Levels:** 74.47 (Recent High), 74.16 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for No Supply Test below $74.20 or Up Thrust Rejection above $74.47.
- **Invalidation:** N/A (Bond ETF, VSA signals often muted by macro factors)
---
### BNS (NEUTRAL/BULLISH bias)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result Down

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Weekly Sequence is Supply Dominance. However, the last weekly bar has high volume (RelVol 1.41) on a wide spread (1.99), closing strongly in the upper half (0.71 CLV). This is a bullish response following the heavy selling bar on Jan 5 (RelVol 1.88, CLV -0.60). The volume on the last bar suggests smart money absorbed supply/initiated buying, overcoming the recent selling wave. This action attempts to reverse the short-term weakness, aligning with the BULLISH Quarterly Trend.

**Key Levels:** 74.53 (Previous Resistance), 71.77 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $73.76 or No Supply Test near $72.50
- **Invalidation:** Below $71.63 (Jan 5 Low)
---
### BOX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Selling Climax)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Weekly Sequence is Supply Dominance. The last weekly bar shows an extremely wide spread down (4.01) closing at the absolute low (-0.99 CLV) on extremely high volume (RelVol 1.99). This is textbook selling climax/panic selling, reinforcing the BEARISH Quarterly Trend. The weak close confirms sellers retain control in the short term, but the extreme volume suggests a potential immediate reaction bounce is imminent.

**Key Levels:** 29.84 (Immediate Resistance), 25.82 (Selling Climax Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a No Demand Test or immediate reversal confirmation (Stopping Volume) near $25.80 before considering short positions.
- **Invalidation:** Above $28.00 (Mid-point of climax bar)
---
### BP (NEUTRAL/BULLISH bias)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result Down

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Weekly Sequence is Supply Dominance. The last weekly bar is a wide spread up (2.23) closing mid-range (0.18 CLV) on high volume (RelVol 1.52). Although the close is mediocre (showing selling pressure at the highs), the fact that it absorbed the massive volume from the prior week (Jan 5, RelVol 1.86, CLV -0.37) and managed a higher close suggests significant demand entered the market. This looks like a successful reversal effort, despite the short-term resistance.

**Key Levels:** 36.29 (Immediate Resistance), 34.06 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close above $35.83 or Test/No Supply confirmation near $34.50.
- **Invalidation:** Below $34.06
---
### BRBR (NEUTRAL/BULLISH bias)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly Sequence shows confirmed Supply Dominance, but the last two weekly bars show potential reversal attempts. The most recent bar is a wide spread up (2.86) closing strong (0.57 CLV) on high volume (RelVol 1.39). This strong upward move following intense selling (Jan 5, RelVol 1.31) suggests stopping volume and initial Smart Money buying coming in near $21.67. This high volume, coupled with the decent close, indicates absorption of previous supply.

**Key Levels:** 24.53 (Immediate Resistance), 21.67 (Stopping Volume Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $24.53 or No Supply Test near $23.00.
- **Invalidation:** Below $21.67
---
### BRZE (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Selling Climax)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Weekly Sequence is Supply Dominance, reinforced by the monthly Buying Climax confirmation (distribution). The latest weekly bar is an extreme wide spread down (7.59) closing at the absolute low (-0.96 CLV) on very high volume (RelVol 2.10). This is aggressive panic selling/selling climax, validating the prior bearish signals. While a climax often precedes a bounce, the immediate control is overwhelmingly with the sellers.

**Key Levels:** 30.45 (Immediate Resistance), 22.86 (Selling Climax Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for No Demand Test or confirmation of short-term bottom before taking any action. Current momentum favors shorts.
- **Invalidation:** Above $28.00 (Mid-range of recent moves)
---
### BSX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Selling Climax)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Weekly Sequence is Supply Dominance. The last bar is a very wide spread down (10.68) closing near the low (-0.84 CLV) on huge volume (RelVol 1.82). This is a strong Selling Climax/panic bar, severely damaging the price structure and reinforcing the BEARISH Quarterly Trend. The massive volume indicates institutional selling is driving the price down rapidly.

**Key Levels:** 97.90 (Immediate Resistance), 87.22 (Selling Climax Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a No Demand Test or confirmation of short-term bottom. Short entry confirmation below $87.22.
- **Invalidation:** Above $94.00 (Mid-range of climax)
---
### BSY (NEUTRAL/BEARISH bias)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result Down

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly context is Supply Dominance. The last weekly bar shows a wide spread down (1.93) closing poorly (-0.58 CLV) on above-average volume (RelVol 1.22). This suggests supply is still present, especially at higher levels after the previous week's rally (Jan 5). The effort (volume) failed to create a great result (poor close). Overall, the bearish trend remains intact, but the volume suggests some absorption.

**Key Levels:** 40.66 (Resistance), 38.73 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $38.73 or No Demand confirmation near $40.00.
- **Invalidation:** Above $40.66
---
### BXSL (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Absorption/Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly Sequence shows CONFIRMED_EARLY Supply Dominance, but the last weekly bar indicates demand returning. The bar has a decent spread (1.09), closes very strongly near the high (0.74 CLV) on high volume (RelVol 1.02). This suggests smart money aggressively bought into the sell-off earlier in the week (low $25.56), showing absorption of supply. This is a strong sign of demand entering the market near recent lows.

**Key Levels:** 27.07 (Resistance), 25.56 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $26.65 or No Supply Test towards $26.00.
- **Invalidation:** Below $25.56
---
### CAI (NEUTRAL/BEARISH bias)
**VSA Status:** Up Thrust/Effort No Result Down

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Weekly Sequence detected STOPPING_VOLUME, yet the last bar is very ambiguous. It shows a wide spread (4.31) with high volume (RelVol 2.33), but closes poorly (-0.03 CLV). Price attempted a rally to $29.00 but was heavily rejected, suggesting Smart Money selling pressure entering the market (Up Thrust characteristics, though without a new high). The high volume indicates large transactions occurring, likely distribution countering absorption attempts.

**Key Levels:** 29.32 (Resistance), 24.69 (Stopping Volume Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for clear confirmation (e.g., No Demand below $27.00, or strong demand push above $29.00).
- **Invalidation:** Below $24.69
---
### CCOI (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Demand Persistence

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly Sequence is a confirmed Buying Climax, suggesting long-term distribution risk, but the short-term trend is bullish. The last weekly bar is a wide spread up (1.97) closing strongly (0.61 CLV) on slightly below-average volume (RelVol 0.70). This continues the strong demand seen in the Jan 5 bar (CLV 0.85). Although volume is not spiking, the consistent strong closes indicate demand is overcoming immediate supply.

**Key Levels:** 24.23 (Immediate Resistance), 22.26 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $24.23 or shallow retracement/No Supply Test towards $23.50.
- **Invalidation:** Below $22.26
---
### CEG (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Selling Climax)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Weekly Sequence is Supply Dominance. The last bar is an extremely wide spread down (46.40) closing poorly near the low (-0.69 CLV) on very high volume (RelVol 2.20). This is a massive selling climax bar, confirming aggressive institutional selling pressure following the deep drop from the previous week. This reinforces the BEARISH Quarterly Trend and suggests price is in a panic phase.

**Key Levels:** 346.81 (Immediate Resistance), 300.41 (Selling Climax Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for short-term accumulation confirmation, or continuation break below $300.41.
- **Invalidation:** Above $340.00 (Mid-range of climax bar)
---
### CELC (NEUTRAL/BEARISH bias)
**VSA Status:** Up Thrust/Rejection

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly Sequence is confirmed Supply Dominance. The last weekly bar shows a wide spread up (16.06) but closes poorly in the lower half (-0.18 CLV) on below-average volume (RelVol 0.65). Price attempted a huge run to $116.44 but was sharply rejected, indicating significant selling (distribution) at high levels. The poor close suggests sellers are retaining control, despite the wide spread.

**Key Levels:** 116.44 (Up Thrust High/Resistance), 100.38 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $100.38 or No Demand Test confirmation towards $110.00.
- **Invalidation:** Above $116.44
---
### CORT (NEUTRAL/BEARISH bias)
**VSA Status:** Supply Persistence (Effort No Result Up)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Weekly Sequence detected STOPPING_VOLUME, but the action is highly erratic due to the massive spread down on Dec 29 (Selling Climax/Panic). The last bar has high volume (RelVol 1.58) on a wide spread (3.57) but closes poorly near the low (-0.89 CLV). This suggests that attempts to rally from the previous climax low failed, and heavy supply immediately returned, pushing the price back down. The immediate short-term weakness remains dominant.

**Key Levels:** 38.11 (Immediate Resistance), 34.54 (Recent Low Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for confirmation of support/demand below $34.54, or No Demand Test near $36.00.
- **Invalidation:** Above $38.11
---
### CPNG (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Selling Climax)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Weekly Sequence is Supply Dominance. The last weekly bar is a wide spread down (2.15) closing poorly (-0.62 CLV) on extreme volume (RelVol 2.36). This is a major Selling Climax bar, continuing the BEARISH trend and reinforcing the selling pressure. The high volume suggests panic selling or aggressive institutional disposal.

**Key Levels:** 22.87 (Immediate Resistance), 20.72 (Selling Climax Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for confirmed short-term bottom (Stopping Volume) or break below $20.72.
- **Invalidation:** Above $22.87
---
### CRBG (NEUTRAL/BEARISH bias)
**VSA Status:** Supply Persistence (Low Volume)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Weekly Sequence is CONFIRMED_STRONG Supply Dominance. The last weekly bar is a narrow spread (0.93) closing mid-range (0.08 CLV) on slightly above average volume (RelVol 1.05). This bar, following a major mark-down phase, shows the selling pressure easing, but no strong demand has stepped in yet (lack of decisive close). This suggests a temporary pause or consolidation under weakness, confirming the bearish control remains.

**Key Levels:** 30.92 (Immediate Resistance), 29.98 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $29.98 or No Demand Test towards $30.60.
- **Invalidation:** Above $30.92
---
### CTRA (NEUTRAL/BEARISH bias)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax Rejection

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Weekly Sequence detected BUYING_CLIMAX. The last bar shows a very wide spread (3.80) with huge volume (RelVol 2.47), but closes poorly in the lower half (-0.46 CLV). Price attempted to reach $28.48 but was swiftly rejected and closed mid-range. This high volume, coupled with the poor close, suggests Smart Money distribution or a successful test of prior supply, reinforcing the bearish tone following the Buying Climax signal.

**Key Levels:** 28.48 (Climax High/Resistance), 24.68 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $24.68 or No Demand Test towards $27.00.
- **Invalidation:** Above $28.48
---
### DUOL (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Selling Climax)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Both Quarterly and Monthly trends are BEARISH. The last weekly bar shows a wide spread down (22.40) closing near the low (-0.78 CLV) on extremely high volume (RelVol 1.84). This confirms aggressive selling and panic (Selling Climax), indicating the mark-down phase is in full force. The move is severely weakening the price structure.

**Key Levels:** 170.10 (Immediate Resistance), 147.70 (Selling Climax Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for confirmed short-term bottom (Stopping Volume). Short entry confirmation below $147.70.
- **Invalidation:** Above $170.10
---
### ENOV (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Selling Climax)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Weekly Sequence is Supply Dominance. The last bar is an extremely wide spread down (6.31) closing near the low (-0.88 CLV) on very high volume (RelVol 1.81). This is a massive Selling Climax bar, confirming the aggressive selling pressure and continuing the BEARISH Quarterly Trend. This action suggests panic or institutional dumping.

**Key Levels:** 29.89 (Immediate Resistance), 23.58 (Selling Climax Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for confirmed short-term bottom (Stopping Volume). Short entry confirmation below $23.58.
- **Invalidation:** Above $28.00 (Mid-range of climax bar)
---
### ENR (NEUTRAL/BEARISH bias)
**VSA Status:** Supply Persistence

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly Sequence is CONFIRMED_EARLY Supply Dominance. The last weekly bar shows a wide spread down (1.43) closing poorly near the low (-0.71 CLV) on above-average volume (RelVol 1.03). This follow-through selling, after the previous week's bullish effort (Jan 5, CLV 0.99), indicates supply is still present and actively pushing the price down, overcoming the demand seen previously.

**Key Levels:** 21.90 (Resistance), 20.47 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $20.47 or No Demand Test towards $21.50.
- **Invalidation:** Above $21.90
---
### FFIV (NEUTRAL/BEARISH bias)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result Down (Up Thrust/Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Weekly Sequence is Supply Dominance. The last bar shows a wide spread (16.17) closing poorly in the lower half (-0.55 CLV) on high volume (RelVol 1.71). Price attempted to break out to $280.75 but was rejected, showing significant supply entering the market (Up Thrust). This confirms the presence of sellers despite the underlying Monthly STOPPING_VOLUME signal. Short-term control is bearish.

**Key Levels:** 280.75 (Up Thrust High/Resistance), 264.58 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $264.58 or No Demand Test towards $275.00.
- **Invalidation:** Above $280.75
---
### FISV (NEUTRAL/BEARISH bias)
**VSA Status:** Supply Persistence (Effort No Result Down)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Weekly Sequence is Supply Dominance. The last weekly bar shows a wide spread down (3.56) closing poorly near the low (-0.82 CLV) on massive volume (RelVol 1.58). This is a strong display of selling pressure. The volume is high enough to be considered a climax, but the poor close confirms sellers retain control. The bullish effort from Jan 5 has been aggressively countered.

**Key Levels:** 69.53 (Immediate Resistance), 65.97 (Selling Climax Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for confirmed short-term bottom (Stopping Volume). Short entry confirmation below $65.97.
- **Invalidation:** Above $69.53
---
### FLEX (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Absorption/Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Weekly Sequence is CONFIRMED_EARLY Supply Dominance, but the last bar signals a reversal. It shows a wide spread up (6.34) closing strongly in the upper half (0.29 CLV) on below-average volume (RelVol 0.86). This is a bullish effort, indicating demand absorbed the selling pressure encountered during the week (low $60.74). The volume suggests the absorption was efficient (not panicky). This action counters the previous bearish trend, aligning with the BULLISH Quarterly Trend.

**Key Levels:** 67.08 (Immediate Resistance), 60.74 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $67.08 or No Supply Test towards $63.00.
- **Invalidation:** Below $60.74
---
### GEN (NEUTRAL/BEARISH bias)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result Down

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Weekly Sequence is confirmed STOPPING_VOLUME, indicating potential underlying strength, but the last weekly bar is bearish. It has a narrow spread (1.00) closing poorly (-0.80 CLV) on high volume (RelVol 1.13). Price attempted a minor rally but failed dramatically, closing near the low. The high volume suggests sellers met the attempted rally with supply. This suggests a weak Test or a failure to sustain demand, keeping the immediate short-term bias bearish within the BEARISH Quarterly Trend.

**Key Levels:** 27.00 (Immediate Resistance), 26.00 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for clear demand signal (strong close up on low volume) or break below $26.00.
- **Invalidation:** Above $27.00
---
### GKOS (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly sequence shows a BUYING_CLIMAX followed by a WATCH_FOR_TEST stage. The last weekly bar (Jan 12) is a wide spread up close on very high relative volume (1.53), suggesting major effort by buyers. However, the closing location (CLV 0.89) is slightly below the high, and this high volume/wide spread move potentially signals professional distribution near the highs (121.62). Smart money is likely taking profits after the monthly Buying Climax indication.

**Key Levels:** 121.63 (High of Climax), 116.22 (Previous Week's Close/Support), 109.00 (Recent Low Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Failure to hold 120.00 or a high volume down bar (signaling reversal).
- **Invalidation:** 121.63 (If sustained breakout above this level)
---
### GRMN (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Weekly analysis confirms SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The current week (Jan 12) shows a narrow spread bar closing neutrally (CLV 0.02) on high volume (RelVol 0.97). This action, following a strong upthrust (Jan 05: wide spread up, high CLV, high volume 0.96), indicates a lack of follow-through from buyers and possible professional selling capping the rally. This is 'Effort No Result' to the upside, suggesting supply is waiting at 214.50.

**Key Levels:** 214.46 (High Resistance), 208.98 (Previous low/Initial Support), 201.50 (Swing low support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below the previous weekly low (208.98).
- **Invalidation:** 214.46 (Recent high)
---
### HDB (BEARISH (Potential Oversold Bounce))
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Capitulation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence shows confirmed SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The Jan 05 bar was a massive down move on huge volume (RelVol 2.88), suggesting capitulation. The current bar (Jan 12) is a down bar on high volume (RelVol 1.51) closing near the low (CLV -0.44), indicating sustained selling pressure. While deeply oversold, the lack of Stopping Volume confirmation suggests sellers remain in control until a clear reversal signal appears.

**Key Levels:** 32.29 (New Low/Support), 33.50 (Minor Resistance), 35.00 (Key Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a clear No Demand test of 33.50 before shorting, or Stopping Volume confirmation before considering long swing trade.
- **Invalidation:** 36.00 (If demand successfully pushes price back above previous accumulation zone)
---
### IONQ (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result / Weakness

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly context is BUYING_CLIMAX (CONFIRMED_EARLY), suggesting the major trend is under threat. The last weekly bar (Jan 12) is an up close (CLV 0.51) on high volume (RelVol 0.89), but the bar spread is wide and the close is only halfway up the spread relative to the high (51.91). This suggests that despite significant buying effort, supply appeared above 51.91, hindering the rally. This lack of follow-through after major selling in December indicates weakness.

**Key Levels:** 51.91 (Recent High Resistance), 49.45 (Prior Close Support), 47.33 (Initial Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 49.00 confirming supply dominance.
- **Invalidation:** 52.61 (Breakout above this level would negate the current supply pressure)
---
### IOT (NEUTRAL (Watching for supply confirmation))
**VSA Status:** Effort to Rise (Neutral/Weak)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly sequence shows BUYING_CLIMAX (WATCH_FOR_TEST), which implies underlying weakness. The last weekly bar (Jan 12) is a wide spread up bar closing midway (CLV 0.37) on high volume (RelVol 1.69). Although volume is high and the spread is wide, the close is soft, suggesting that professional money may be selling into the strength, thus creating 'Effort No Result' for buyers at the high. The recent monthly close confirmed extreme weakness (CLV 0.04), so this weak rally is likely a reaction.

**Key Levels:** 35.87 (High Resistance), 33.91 (Prior Support), 32.71 (Recent Low Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Confirmation of supply (No Demand bar or next down bar on volume).
- **Invalidation:** 35.87 (If price sustains above this level)
---
### IREN (NEUTRAL (Extreme Volatility/Distribution warning))
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Thrust

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar (Jan 12) is a major, wide spread up bar, closing near the high (CLV 0.85) on extremely high volume (RelVol 1.46, and high absolute volume 280M). This extreme price and volume action, occurring after a significant recent run-up, strongly suggests a Buying Climax. While the price closed high, the sheer magnitude of volume at these new highs suggests professional selling/distribution is likely occurring in this volatile environment. The monthly sequence shows SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (WATCH_FOR_TEST), supporting the view that this is a final blow-off.

**Key Levels:** 58.75 (Climax High), 46.00 (Prior Resistance/Potential Support), 45.85 (Low of Climax Bar)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Significant down bar on high volume, or inability to breach 58.75, followed by weakness.
- **Invalidation:** 58.75 (A strong close above this would negate the climax warning)
---
### ITT (NEUTRAL/WEAK)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result (Weakness)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly sequence shows SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The last weekly bar (Jan 12) is an up bar (CLV 0.42) on above-average volume (RelVol 1.02). Although it closed up, the spread is wide but the close is middling, indicating that buyers faced supply near the high (185.00). This suggests the market is struggling to rally higher despite effort, fitting the narrative of underlying supply dominance.

**Key Levels:** 185.00 (High Resistance), 180.29 (Low Support), 178.00 (Minor Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 180.29 confirming renewed selling pressure.
- **Invalidation:** 185.00 (If demand breaks through and sustains above the high)
---
### KDP (NEUTRAL/WEAK)
**VSA Status:** Effort to Rise (Weak)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly sequence shows BUYING_CLIMAX (WATCH_FOR_TEST), implying weakness at higher timeframes. The last weekly bar (Jan 12) is a wide spread bar down, closing near the low (CLV -0.81) on high volume (RelVol 0.89). This represents sellers returning immediately after the previous week's modest rally (Jan 05: up bar, high CLV, RelVol 0.51). The soft close on the down bar suggests supply is dominant and that the previous buying efforts failed to absorb the overall supply.

**Key Levels:** 28.36 (High Resistance), 27.31 (Low Support), 27.41 (Current Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 27.31 (confirming range break).
- **Invalidation:** 28.36 (If demand overcomes recent high resistance)
---
### KEY (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Weakness Confirmed

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly sequence shows confirmed SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The last weekly bar (Jan 12) is an up bar closing in the middle (CLV 0.43) on slightly high volume (RelVol 0.91). Critically, this bar failed to rise significantly after the wide spread down bar the week prior (Jan 05, CLV -0.43, RelVol 0.78). The close is slightly up, but the lack of strong demand follow-through against the confirmed monthly supply suggests this small rally is merely a selling opportunity (No Demand or Upthrust condition).

**Key Levels:** 21.41 (High Resistance), 20.56 (Low Support), 21.17 (Current Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Formation of a No Demand bar followed by a break below 21.00.
- **Invalidation:** 21.75 (If price overcomes the recent high)
---
### KYMR (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax / Weakness Confirmed

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly sequence is BUYING_CLIMAX (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The last weekly bar (Jan 12) is a wide spread down bar, closing almost at the absolute low (CLV -0.96) on average volume (RelVol 0.84). This bar follows two weeks of highly negative closes (CLV -0.87, -0.87). While the low volume suggests exhaustion (potential Selling Climax), the severe close near the lows confirms strong short-term weakness and a failure of demand to step in aggressively at these levels. The quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the immediate monthly trend suggests distribution at the highs.

**Key Levels:** 76.71 (Immediate Resistance), 69.41 (New Low Support), 72.76 (Prior Close/Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a No Supply bar or a failure to rally above 72.76.
- **Invalidation:** 76.71 (If price recovers significantly)
---
### MOD (NEUTRAL/BULLISH (Short-term))
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Upthrust Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence signals STOPPING_VOLUME (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The previous week (Jan 05) was extreme weakness (Wide spread down, huge volume, CLV -0.20), suggesting a possible selling climax. The current bar (Jan 12) is a strong wide spread up bar closing high (CLV 0.70) on high volume (RelVol 1.19), effectively absorbing the prior selling pressure. This strong reversal confirms the presence of demand (Stopping Volume is working).

**Key Levels:** 139.39 (High Resistance), 122.21 (Low of Demand Bar), 146.26 (Overhead Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A subsequent test (No Supply) of the demand zone (125.00-130.00).
- **Invalidation:** 122.21 (If price falls back into the Selling Climax zone)
---
### ONB (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Effort to Rise (Neutral/Weak)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly sequence confirms STRONG SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The last weekly bar (Jan 12) is an up bar closing in the upper half (CLV 0.55) on high volume (RelVol 1.11). While the closing price is constructive, the spread is relatively narrow given the volume. This suggests that despite the effort from buyers (high volume), the resultant price movement was middling, indicating underlying supply (likely related to the strong monthly supply dominance) capping the rally.

**Key Levels:** 23.50 (High Resistance), 22.40 (Initial Support), 23.26 (Current Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Failure to hold 23.00, or a break above 23.50.
- **Invalidation:** 23.50 (If the price achieves a decisive breakout on volume)
---
### PSA (NEUTRAL/WEAK)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Effort No Result

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence shows confirmed SUPPLY_DOMINANCE, but the last weekly bar (Jan 12) is a wide spread up bar, closing near the high (CLV 0.83) on very high volume (RelVol 1.92). This suggests a strong bullish surge, potentially offsetting the prior weakness. However, given the extreme volume and the context of overall resistance, this high volume move could be a Buying Climax. The monthly CLV is high (0.90) also confirming the upward thrust. This situation is contradictory: long-term supply dominance vs. short-term Buying Climax. We treat the climax as the current threat.

**Key Levels:** 295.72 (Climax High), 278.31 (Initial Support), 273.70 (Low Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Reversal bar (No Demand) below 290.00 or break below 278.00.
- **Invalidation:** 295.72 (If price achieves strong continuation above this high)
---
### PTGX (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Upthrust Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly sequence shows BUYING_CLIMAX (WATCH_FOR_TEST), implying weakness at higher levels. The last two weekly bars show mixed signals. Jan 05 was a wide spread down bar closing low (CLV -0.75) on high volume (RelVol 1.02)—potential Selling Climax/Stopping Volume. The current bar (Jan 12) is a wide spread up bar closing negatively (CLV -0.25) on high volume (RelVol 0.88). This close suggests that although volume increased on the rally, the failure to close strongly indicates supply is absorbing the demand, turning the demand move into an Upthrust or a weak rally.

**Key Levels:** 87.44 (High Resistance), 78.75 (Low Support), 80.22 (Prior Close Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Failure to hold 81.00 or confirmed strength above 87.44.
- **Invalidation:** 78.75 (If price breaks below the low of the potential stopping action)
---
### QQQI (NEUTRAL/WEAK)
**VSA Status:** Weakness (Distribution)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly sequence shows BUYING_CLIMAX (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The last weekly bar (Jan 12) is an up bar closing negatively (CLV -0.02) on high volume (RelVol 1.45). This is a strong Effort No Result. Buyers made a strong attempt (high volume), but the price struggled to move higher, closing near the middle/low. This inability to generate follow-through on high effort confirms the presence of supply consistent with the monthly climax warning.

**Key Levels:** 54.85 (High Resistance), 53.90 (Low Support), 54.64 (Prior Close Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 54.00, confirming short-term weakness.
- **Invalidation:** 54.85 (If price decisively closes above this high)
---
### RGLD (NEUTRAL (Distribution Warning))
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Thrust

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly sequence shows SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The last weekly bar (Jan 12) is a wide spread up bar, closing near the high (CLV 0.96) on slightly high volume (RelVol 1.05). This move pushed the price to new highs, potentially completing a climax move, especially considering the monthly context. Although the close is strong, the high volume near previous supply zones (248.08 high from Jan 05) often signals distribution into strength. This is an overbought condition in the face of long-term supply warnings.

**Key Levels:** 265.48 (New High Resistance), 253.10 (Immediate Support), 246.96 (Low of Thrust Bar)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Weakness/Reversal bar below 260.00 or a clear No Demand test.
- **Invalidation:** 265.48 (If price sees decisive continuation above this level)
---
### RGTI (NEUTRAL/WEAK)
**VSA Status:** Weakness / Effort No Result

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly sequence confirms BUYING_CLIMAX. The last weekly bar (Jan 12) is an up bar closing in the middle (CLV 0.36) on high volume (RelVol 0.57). This represents another week where strong buying effort resulted in a marginal, middling close, confirming that supply is capping the rally (Effort No Result). Given the confirmed Buying Climax, this inability to rise definitively suggests professionals are still distributing the stock.

**Key Levels:** 26.49 (High Resistance), 25.62 (Current Close), 23.76 (Low Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Failure to hold 25.50 or a strong down bar on volume.
- **Invalidation:** 26.49 (If price closes strongly above this high)
---
### RTO (NEUTRAL/BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Weak Follow-Through)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence indicates STOPPING_VOLUME (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The last weekly bar (Jan 12) is an up bar, closing in the middle (CLV 0.16) on high volume (RelVol 2.29). This follows a strong breakout bar (Jan 05: wide spread up, high CLV 0.81). While volume is high, the middling close suggests selling pressure appeared near the highs (32.20), limiting the rise. However, the volume being high on an up bar indicates substantial activity, suggesting continued demand absorption or a minor pushback from supply. Contextually bullish, but needs a test to confirm distribution is finished.

**Key Levels:** 32.20 (High Resistance), 31.61 (Prior Close Support), 30.62 (Low Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A clear No Supply test of 31.00 or break above 32.20.
- **Invalidation:** 30.62 (If selling breaks the low of the demand zone)
---
### SA (NEUTRAL/WEAK)
**VSA Status:** Weakness / Effort No Result

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly sequence confirms SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The last weekly bar (Jan 12) is a wide spread down bar, closing middling (CLV -0.27) on high volume (RelVol 0.94). This comes immediately after the previous week's large up bar (Jan 05: wide spread up, high CLV, RelVol 1.09). The reversal down on the current bar suggests that the buying effort (Jan 05) was met by strong supply, resulting in 'Effort No Result' for demand. This behavior aligns with the underlying monthly bearish context.

**Key Levels:** 32.29 (High Resistance), 30.04 (Low Support), 30.86 (Current Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 30.04.
- **Invalidation:** 32.29 (If price achieves a decisive breakout on high volume)
---
### STAA (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
STAA is in a quarterly bearish trend. The latest weekly candle (2026-01-12) shows High Volume (RelVol 1.91) but a wide spread and a close near the low (CLV -0.04), indicating selling pressure is still dominating, despite the volume suggesting potential absorption/Stopping Volume. The prior week (2026-01-05) was extreme Selling Climax (CLV 0.03, High Vol). We are watching for a No Supply test.

**Key Levels:** Support: 19.40 (SC Low), Resistance: 23.60 (Previous Low Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Price must decisively breach above 23.60 on confirming volume, or show a successful No Supply test near 20.00.
- **Invalidation:** 19.39 (Breaking the low of the Stopping Volume/Selling Climax area)
---
### SYF (NEUTRAL/BULLISH bias)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
SYF is in a bullish quarterly trend. The last weekly bar (2026-01-12) saw extreme volume (RelVol 2.17) on a wide spread, but the CLV is positive (0.52), meaning the close was in the upper half despite the sell-off early in the week. This looks like a shakeout or a Selling Climax, suggesting Smart Money bought heavily into the panic selling. We are watching for confirmation (a Test or immediate strength).

**Key Levels:** Support: 74.95 (SC Low), Resistance: 84.65 (Prior consolidation), Key Pivot: 81.84 (High of SC candle)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Successful No Supply test below 80.00, or a break and hold above 81.84 on good volume.
- **Invalidation:** 74.90 (A close below the Selling Climax low)
---
### UBSI (NEUTRAL/BEARISH bias)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
UBSI is flagged for a Buying Climax, despite the bullish quarterly trend. The last two weekly candles (2026-01-05 and 2026-01-12) show high volume (RelVol 1.66 and 1.42) on narrow/medium spreads, with high CLV (0.80 and 0.67), suggesting intense effort to push higher, but the narrow spread suggests supply is meeting that demand near the high 41s. The recent bar shows failure to hold high ground and a deceleration in upward movement relative to volume.

**Key Levels:** Support: 40.00 (Recent pivot), Resistance: 41.53 (BC high)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a No Demand Test (weak volume on a down bar) or a decisive break below 40.00 to confirm supply.
- **Invalidation:** 41.53 (A new high would negate the climax signal)
---
### USB (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
USB is in a strong bullish quarterly trend. The latest weekly bar (2026-01-12) shows huge volume (RelVol 1.85) on a relatively narrow spread, with a positive CLV (0.32). This high volume came after a substantial intraday drop to 53.22, suggesting heavy Smart Money accumulation/Stopping Volume (Shakeout). The close near the middle/high indicates demand absorbed the selling.

**Key Levels:** Support: 53.23 (Shakeout low), Resistance: 56.20 (Recent high)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A rally above 55.21 (previous high close) or a successful low-volume No Supply test near 54.00.
- **Invalidation:** 53.20 (Breaking the low of the Stopping Volume bar)
---
### USIG (NEUTRAL/BEARISH bias)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
USIG is displaying Supply Dominance on the weekly chart with extreme volume (RelVol 2.61) on the last bar (2026-01-12). Although the spread is narrow (typical for ETFs/Bonds), the close is negative (CLV -0.41), meaning the intense volume pushed the price lower relative to the spread. This indicates heavy supply is entering the market, halting the previous small rally.

**Key Levels:** Support: 51.81 (Recent low), Resistance: 52.12 (High of supply bar)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A successful No Demand test (weak rally) followed by a break below 51.81.
- **Invalidation:** 52.12 (A new high on confirming volume)
---
### VGLT (NEUTRAL/BEARISH bias)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
VGLT is in a quarterly bearish trend. The last two weekly bars show persistent high volume (RelVol 1.87, 1.88). The latest bar (2026-01-12) has a negative CLV (-0.53) on high volume, suggesting supply is still controlling the minor downtrend despite recent attempts to rally. The high volume indicates continued struggle/churning at these levels, often preceding a markdown.

**Key Levels:** Support: 55.91 (Recent low), Resistance: 56.60 (Recent high)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 55.90 on confirming volume, confirming the bearish trend continuation.
- **Invalidation:** 56.60 (Clearing the high of the Supply Dominance bar)
---
### WGMI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Confirmed Strong - Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
WGMI just printed a confirmed strong Buying Climax. The bar on 2026-01-12 shows very high volume (RelVol 1.07), a wide spread, and an extremely high close (CLV 0.80). However, the monthly context flagged a BC (Watch for Test), and the weekly action (last 3 bars) shows massive vertical movement followed by churning. The monthly CLV (0.89) suggests the rally is stretching to exhaustion. While the weekly close is high, the overall volatility and volume suggest a possible top is being formed in the context of the previous extreme sell-off in November/December.

**Key Levels:** Support: 44.34 (Last weekly low), Resistance: 51.78 (BC high)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a clear sign of weakness, such as a sharp break below 49.00 or a high-volume reversal.
- **Invalidation:** 51.78 (New high above the climax bar)
---
### WKC (NEUTRAL/BEARISH bias)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
WKC is in a strong bullish quarterly trend but flagged a Buying Climax. The bar on 2026-01-05 had extreme volume (RelVol 1.49) with a wide spread and high close (CLV 0.77). The follow-up bar (2026-01-12) maintained high volume (RelVol 1.88) but had a narrower spread and a weak close (CLV 0.08), indicating supply has entered the market and is dominating near the highs. This suggests distribution/supply is active.

**Key Levels:** Support: 27.00 (Recent low), Resistance: 28.16 (BC high)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 26.93 on confirming volume, confirming supply domination.
- **Invalidation:** 28.16 (New high, negating the climax signal)
---
### XEL (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Confirmed Early)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Despite the Bearish Quarterly Trend and the Supply Dominance flag, the weekly chart suggests a short-term shakeout. The bar on 2026-01-12 shows high volume (RelVol 1.44), a wide spread, but closed in the upper half (CLV 0.46), suggesting absorption of supply and demand entering strongly. This action is reversing the initial supply signals from December (CLV -0.86). The 'Supply Dominance' is likely an initial panic/shakeout that was absorbed, turning it into a potential Spring or SC.

**Key Levels:** Support: 73.50 (Shakeout low), Resistance: 76.39 (Recent high)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and hold above 76.39 on confirming volume, or a successful No Supply test near 74.00.
- **Invalidation:** 73.50 (Close below the shakeout low)
---
