## 🚀 Ready for Entry
### BIRK (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Significant Down Bar

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Weekly chart confirms SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The latest weekly bar is a significant down bar with a wide spread (6.46), closing near the absolute low (CLV -0.91) on very high volume (RelVol 1.84). This is a strong sign of selling pressure and heavy professional distribution, breaking through recent support levels. Quarterly trend is also BEARISH.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Resistance: 41.97 (Previous consolidation low), Supply Zone: 44.65 - 45.00, New Support Target: 38.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Daily confirmation of breakdown below $38.20 (low of latest bar) or a failed rally attempt (No Demand) into $40.
- **Invalidation:** $44.92 (High of previous week, confirming shift in supply/demand balance)
---
### BKKT (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort to Rise (Weakening)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Despite a monthly SUPPLY_DOMINANCE signal (WATCH_FOR_TEST), the last two weekly bars show massive upward movement (5.16 and 6.61 spreads) with high volume (RelVol 1.04 and 1.21), confirming strong buying interest and continuation after a recent price surge. The last bar closed near the high (CLV 0.78), indicating high EFFORT to rise with a good RESULT. However, the monthly context remains WATCH_FOR_TEST, suggesting some distribution occurred in the prior month. For now, the weekly strength dominates.

**Key Levels:** Support/Re-accumulation: 15.50, Recent High/Target: 22.11, Monthly Supply Zone: 27.20

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Pullback to $16.50 - $17.50 range with a No Supply test, or break and hold above $22.11.
- **Invalidation:** $15.50 (Break below recent swing low on high volume)
---
### BKV (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Upthrust Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Weekly signal STOPPING_VOLUME is CONFIRMED_EARLY. After a wide spread down bar two weeks ago on high volume, the latest bar is a relatively narrow spread up bar (1.77) closing strongly (CLV 0.49), also on high volume (RelVol 1.15). This suggests absorption of supply at lower levels ($24.93). The strong close indicates demand is taking control after stopping the downtrend. This looks like a successful test of the recent low.

**Key Levels:** Accumulation Zone: 24.93 - 25.80, Target Resistance: 28.30, Quarterly Trend Support: 27.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Daily close above $26.70 (high of latest bar) or pullback to $25.50 with a successful test.
- **Invalidation:** $24.90 (Break below Stopping Volume low)
---
### BL (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Heavy Selling

**Smart Money Logic:**
Weekly chart shows SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The latest bar is a very wide spread down (7.39) closing near the low (CLV -0.51) on heavy volume (RelVol 2.04). This is a strong bearish signal indicating professional selling and a potential break of structural support. The Quarterly Context is BEARISH_TREND, reinforcing the downside pressure.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Resistance: 56.65 (Open of down bar), Prior Support Zone: 57.00 - 58.00, Target Support: 50.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Breakdown below $50.85 (low of latest bar) or a failed rally attempt (No Demand) into $54.00.
- **Invalidation:** $58.25 (High of latest bar, indicating renewed demand)
---
### BOX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Shakeout

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Weekly chart confirms a strong SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The latest bar is an extreme wide spread down (4.01) closing near the absolute low (CLV -0.98) on very high volume (RelVol 1.98). This is a strong Shakeout/Distribution bar, breaking critical support levels. Quarterly Context is BEARISH_TREND, confirming the weakness.

**Key Levels:** Resistance/Supply: 29.70 - 30.12, Breakdown Level: 28.75, Target Support: 25.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Failed rally (No Demand) toward $27.00, or continued move below $25.80 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** $29.73 (Open of the Supply Dominance bar)
---
### BRKR (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Upthrust / Confirmed Distribution

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly sequence signaled STOPPING_VOLUME last month, suggesting a potential low was in place. However, the latest weekly bar shows an extremely wide spread down (8.38) closing near the absolute low (CLV -0.86) on heavy volume (RelVol 1.21). This move wiped out the gains of the previous week's rally (Effort to Rise) and confirms massive distribution/upthrust above $55.00, restarting the BEARISH_TREND.

**Key Levels:** Supply Zone: 54.50 - 56.22, New Resistance: 55.00, Target Support: 47.84

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Daily close below $48.38 or a failed rally (No Demand) toward $50.00.
- **Invalidation:** $56.22 (High of the Upthrust bar)
---
### BRZE (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Confirmed Buying Climax / Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly sequence confirmed a BUYING_CLIMAX, which is now playing out strongly. The latest weekly bar is a massive wide spread down (7.58) closing near the absolute low (CLV -0.95) on extreme volume (RelVol 2.09). This is undeniable SUPPLY_DOMINANCE, confirming the high was institutional distribution. This move breaks several key support zones and signals a sharp drop.

**Key Levels:** Major Resistance/Supply: 29.70 - 30.45, Breakdown Level: 29.50, Target Support: 21.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Immediate continuation below $23.03 or a failed rally (No Demand) into the $25.00 - $26.00 zone.
- **Invalidation:** $29.73 (Open of the Supply Dominance bar)
---
### BSX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Massive Distribution

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Weekly chart confirms a strong SUPPLY_DOMINANCE signal. The last bar is a massive wide spread down (10.68) closing near the low (CLV -0.84) on extreme volume (RelVol 1.81). This move severely breaks major support established in the prior weeks and confirms that the rally into $100+ was major distribution, aligning with the BEARISH_TREND Quarterly context.

**Key Levels:** Major Supply/Resistance: 97.63 (Previous week close), Breakdown Level: 93.86, Target Support: 87.22

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Continued move below $88.00 or a No Demand test into $92.00.
- **Invalidation:** $97.90 (High of the distribution bar, unlikely to be broken quickly)
---
### BWIN (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Demand Confirmed (After Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly trend is bearish (SUPPLY_DOMINANCE WATCH_FOR_TEST), but the weekly chart shows clear demand returning. The latest bar is a wide spread up (2.35), closing strongly near the high (CLV 0.68) on high volume (RelVol 1.36). This follows a sharp drop two weeks ago, suggesting that drop was an involuntary shakeout that was swiftly absorbed by Smart Money accumulation. Current momentum is strong up.

**Key Levels:** Support/Accumulation: 24.65, Immediate Resistance: 27.01, Monthly Supply Zone: 28.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and hold above $27.01 or a pullback to $25.50 with a low volume test (No Supply).
- **Invalidation:** $24.65 (Break below accumulation low)
---
### BXSL (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort to Rise / Demand Return

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly sequence indicates confirmed SUPPLY_DOMINANCE, but the last weekly bar showed a definitive shift. The latest bar is a wide spread up (1.09) closing very strong near the high (CLV 0.74) on good volume (RelVol 1.01). This suggests strong buying (Effort to Rise) is taking place near the recent low ($25.55), potentially reversing the downside momentum derived from the monthly distribution. This is a demand signal overcoming supply.

**Key Levels:** Accumulation Zone: 25.42 - 25.56, Resistance: 26.70, Target: 27.06

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and hold above $26.70 (recent high) or a pullback to $26.00 with a No Supply test.
- **Invalidation:** $25.55 (Break below accumulation low)
---
### CALM (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax / Demand Return

**Smart Money Logic:**
The latest weekly bar shows a clear shift. It is a wide spread up (6.06), closing near the absolute high (CLV 0.97) on very high volume (RelVol 2.07). This is a strong demand bar that followed a massive downside week (Selling Climax/Shakeout), suggesting the selling was absorbed and demand is reasserting control. This strong reaction, while still in a BEARISH_TREND Quarterly context, indicates institutional buying.

**Key Levels:** Support/Climax Low: 71.91, Resistance: 77.98, Target: 82.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and hold above $77.98 (recent high) or a pullback to $74.50 with a No Supply test.
- **Invalidation:** $71.91 (Break below climax low)
---
### CBRL (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort to Rise (Distribution)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Despite the monthly SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (WATCH_FOR_TEST), the latest weekly bar is a significant wide spread up bar (7.29) on extremely high volume (RelVol 1.68). Although the close is mediocre (CLV 0.34), suggesting some supply absorbed the move, the sheer size of the effort and the volume indicates strong institutional participation, successfully pushing price higher and challenging the monthly supply zone.

**Key Levels:** Support: 29.59 (Low of bar), Resistance: 36.88 (High of bar), Prior Supply Zone: 30.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Pullback to $32.00 with a No Supply confirmation. Continuation above $36.88 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** $29.59 (Break below demand support)
---
### CBSH (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort to Rise / Demand Confirmed

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly sequence signals SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (WATCH_FOR_TEST), but the weekly chart shows resilient demand.

Following a SOW (W2), the rally attempt in W1 saw strong volume but failed to close strongly (CLV -0.254). This Effort No Result indicates active supply capping the rally attempts around 87.50 and confirms the continuation of the bearish trend.

**Key Levels:** 87.44 (Resistance), 79.49 (Immediate Resistance), 78.75 (Key Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry below 79.00 upon confirmation of breakdown/No Demand test near 81.00.
- **Invalidation:** 87.44
---
### QQQI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result (Up) / Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
W1 shows Ultra High Volume (1.45) on a very narrow spread, resulting in a central close (CLV -0.026). This extreme Effort No Result confirms aggressive distribution by Smart Money, stalling the price movement at the top of the range (54.85).

**Key Levels:** 54.85 (Distribution High), 54.00 (Immediate Support), 53.56 (Key Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry below 54.00 upon confirmed No Demand test.
- **Invalidation:** 54.85
---
### QTWO (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Sign of Weakness (SOW)

**Smart Money Logic:**
W1 is a wide down bar closing at the extreme low (CLV -0.927). Although volume is low, the decisive drop confirms a lack of counter-demand and the dominance of supply, reinforcing the confirmed bearish trend (SOW continuation).

**Key Levels:** 69.79 (Immediate Resistance), 64.87 (Key Support), 74.66 (Supply Zone)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry below 64.87 (W1 low).
- **Invalidation:** 70.24
---
### RARE (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Failure of Stopping Volume / Sign of Weakness (SOW)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The initial accumulation signal (W3 SC) failed instantly. W1 is a high volume down bar closing at the extreme low, breaking previous support. Supply has returned aggressively, confirming the markdown continuation.

**Key Levels:** 22.95 (Immediate Resistance), 22.07 (Failed Low), 22.40 (New Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry below 22.40 (W1 low).
- **Invalidation:** 24.65
---
### RF (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Sign of Weakness (SOW) / Distribution

**Smart Money Logic:**
A failed rally attempt (W2 ENR) was followed by W1, a down bar on Ultra High Volume (1.13), closing mid-low. This confirms active supply and a Sign of Weakness, confirming the distribution signaled by the monthly Supply Dominance.

**Key Levels:** 29.26 (Distribution Resistance), 27.77 (Immediate Support), 27.34 (Key Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry below 27.77 (W1 close) upon confirmed breakdown of 27.34.
- **Invalidation:** 28.61
---
### RGLD (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Sign of Strength (SOS) / Markup Continuation

**Smart Money Logic:**
W1 saw high volume and a wide up bar closing near the extreme high (CLV 0.961), confirming demand dominance and markup continuation. This momentum suggests the previous monthly supply warning has been overpowered by Smart Money buying.

**Key Levels:** 253.10 (Immediate Support), 248.08 (Breakout Support), 265.48 (Target Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Long entry on shallow pullback/No Supply test towards 260.00.
- **Invalidation:** 246.96
---
### RKT (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result (Up) / Supply Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
A strong rally (W2 SOS) was immediately met by W1, an Ultra High Volume (1.27) down bar with a narrow spread and poor close. This Effort No Result indicates aggressive supply absorbing demand at the 24.36 high, suggesting distribution is active.

**Key Levels:** 24.36 (Distribution High), 22.81 (W1 Open), 22.42 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry below 22.81 (W1 Open) upon confirmed No Demand test.
- **Invalidation:** 24.36
---
### RLI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Confirmation / Effort No Result (Down)

**Smart Money Logic:**
W2 was a sharp SOW. W1 is a narrow down bar on high volume (1.12) closing centrally. The combination of high volume and poor price movement (Effort No Result) confirms supply persistence and a lack of sustained demand, aligning with the bearish quarterly trend.

**Key Levels:** 60.52 (Immediate Resistance), 59.35 (W1 Close), 58.20 (Key Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry below 59.35 (W1 close) upon breakdown of 58.20.
- **Invalidation:** 60.52
---
### RTO (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result (Up) / Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
W1 saw Ultra High Volume (2.29) on a narrow spread, closing mid-low. This extreme Effort No Result following W2's SOS confirms that massive supply has entered the market at 32.20, stopping the upward push and suggesting distribution.

**Key Levels:** 32.20 (Distribution High), 31.54 (Immediate Support), 30.62 (Key Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry below 31.54 (W1 close) upon confirmed breakdown or No Demand test.
- **Invalidation:** 32.20
---
### RVMD (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result (Up) / Secondary Distribution

**Smart Money Logic:**
W2 was a major Buying Climax (4.2x RelVol). W1 continued with Ultra High Volume (1.9x) but closed poorly (CLV 0.245). This Effort No Result confirms the exhaustion of demand and aggressive distribution by Smart Money, using the euphoria created by the climax bar.

**Key Levels:** 124.49 (Climax High), 116.82 (W1 Open), 113.33 (Key Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry below 116.82 (W1 Open) upon confirmed No Demand test or breakdown of 113.33.
- **Invalidation:** 124.49
---
### SA (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Sign of Weakness (SOW) / Supply Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
W1 is a wide down bar on high volume, closing mid-low, confirming continued selling pressure (SOW). This reinforces the bearish bias signaled by the Monthly Supply Dominance, suggesting supply is firmly controlling the price action.

**Key Levels:** 32.01 (Immediate Resistance), 32.52 (Key Supply Zone), 30.04 (Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry below 30.04 (W1 low) upon confirmed breakdown.
- **Invalidation:** 32.29
---
### SATS (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Sign of Weakness (SOW) following Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
A strong rally (W2 SOS/Climax) was followed by W1, an Ultra High Volume (1.96) wide down bar, closing poorly (CLV -0.638). This confirms supply overwhelmed demand, leading to a decisive Sign of Weakness (SOW) and validation of the distribution at the 132.25 high.

**Key Levels:** 132.25 (Distribution High), 122.45 (Immediate Resistance), 121.29 (Key Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry below 121.29 (W1 low) upon breakdown confirmation.
- **Invalidation:** 124.45
---
### SYF (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Despite a strong recent down move, the last weekly bar exhibited clear Stopping Volume characteristics in a BULLISH quarterly trend. Volume was massive (36.41M, RelVol 2.17), combined with the widest spread in the last five weeks (6.89), but the bar managed to close significantly off the lows (CLV 0.52). This indicates major absorption by Smart Money, suggesting the decline is halting and a markdown phase may be ending.

**Key Levels:** 88.77 (Immediate Resistance/Recent High), 74.95 (Stopping Volume Low), 80.19 (Current Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A close above the previous week's open ($79.26) on moderate volume, or a successful low-volume test near the $77.00-$78.00 level.
- **Invalidation:** $74.94 (Below the Stopping Volume low, suggesting professional selling is stronger than absorption)
---
### TRU (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Monthly Stopping Volume (Confirmed Strong)

**Smart Money Logic:**
While the weekly sequence is neutral, the monthly context is highly BULLISH, showing a CONFIRMED_STRONG Stopping Volume signal. The recent weekly action shows a shakeout attempt (week 2025-12-29) followed by immediate recovery (last two weeks). The last week was an Up bar (open 86.12, close 86.22) on moderate volume, closing near the high (CLV 0.66). This suggests demand is firmly in control, overcoming prior short-term supply ($83.33 low). The quarterly trend is BULLISH, supporting the accumulation thesis.

**Key Levels:** 89.12 (Immediate Resistance/Recent High), 81.08 (Prior Shakeout Low), 86.00 (Psychological Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Breakout above $87.80 resistance level on confirming volume.
- **Invalidation:** $82.58 (Below the low of the recovery bar)
---
### USB (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
USB is in a BULLISH quarterly trend. The last weekly bar saw extremely high volume (83.59M, RelVol 1.85) on a wide bar (1.77 spread) that closed well off its low (CLV 0.32). This is classic Stopping Volume, absorbing supply after the pullback from $56.20. The volume suggests Smart Money stepped in aggressively. The close above the midpoint is a strength indicator.

**Key Levels:** 56.20 (Resistance/Recent High), 53.23 (Stopping Volume Low), 54.40 (Current Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A successful Test or No Supply bar on ultra-low volume near $53.50, or a break above $55.00 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** $53.23 (Below the recent low, indicating absorption failed)
---
### WGMI (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Monthly Buying Climax (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
WGMI is highly volatile but in a BULLISH quarterly trend. The last weekly bar was a very wide up bar (7.44 spread) on high volume (4.02M, RelVol 1.07), closing near the high (CLV 0.80). This strong upward thrust confirms demand is dominating, overcoming the minor weakness seen two weeks prior. The monthly chart, however, flagged a Buying Climax, suggesting we are near a peak. The recent strong weekly demand suggests that test is still ahead, or that the climax was overcome by new demand.

**Key Levels:** 51.78 (New Resistance/Recent High), 44.34 (Immediate Support), 47.40 (Prior consolidation area)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Breakout above $51.78, or a shallow, low-volume pullback (No Supply) toward $48.00.
- **Invalidation:** $44.34 (Below the low of the strength bar)
---
### WMG (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Confirmed Strong)

**Smart Money Logic:**
WMG is confirmed in a Buying Climax, despite the BULLISH quarterly trend. Two weeks ago was a strong up bar (CLV 0.87). Last week, volume remained high (9.9M, RelVol 1.02) but the bar was significantly weaker, with a moderate spread (1.25) and closing near the low (CLV -0.64). This poor close on maintained high volume confirms Smart Money distribution into the strength. The rally is likely exhausted, and a reaction down is expected.

**Key Levels:** 31.62 (Climax High/Resistance), 30.37 (Immediate Support), 29.26 (Prior Accumulation Zone)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $30.37 on increased volume, confirming the failure to hold gains.
- **Invalidation:** $31.62 (Break above the climax high, invalidating distribution thesis)
---
### XEL (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Confirmed Early)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Despite the 'Supply Dominance' flag and BEARISH quarterly trend, the context is shifting. Two weeks ago was a strong up bar (CLV 0.32) on high volume. Last week, volume remained high (36.7M, RelVol 1.44) and the bar was UP, closing very strong (CLV 0.46). This high volume on an UP bar (open 74.03, close 75.61) suggests that the bearish trend might be exhausted, and Smart Money is accumulating or marking up the price, overriding the prior Supply Dominance. The rally is showing sustained demand.

**Key Levels:** 76.39 (New Resistance), 73.50 (Immediate Support), 74.03 (Last Week Open)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A test of $74.50 on reduced volume, followed by a move above $76.39.
- **Invalidation:** $73.50 (Failure to hold the recent weekly low)
---
## 👀 Watch/Monitoring
### BHF (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Potential Test Failure

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly sequence shows a clear BUYING_CLIMAX from two months ago, which was followed by low volume downside movement (Monthly CLV -0.69) on the latest monthly bar, indicating supply entering the market. The last Weekly bar showed a wide spread down (0.89) closing poorly near the low (CLV -0.46) on above-average volume (RelVol 0.74). This suggests Smart Money is distributing, especially given the Quarterly Context is BEARISH_TREND, confirming supply dominance despite the recent price consolidation/slight rally failure.

**Key Levels:** Support: 63.79 (Recent Low), Resistance: 65.50 (Recent High), Monthly Climax Zone: 66.33

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Weekly close below $63.79 (low of latest bar) on confirming volume.
- **Invalidation:** $65.51 (Recent high, indicating continuation of demand)
---
### BKSY (NEUTRAL (Watch for Reversal))
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Distribution

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly sequence confirmed a BUYING_CLIMAX. The latest weekly bar saw a wide spread up (5.55) on high volume (RelVol 1.07), but the close was only in the middle-upper range (CLV 0.18), indicating EFFORT NO RESULT to the upside. Smart Money is likely distributing into this strong move, absorbing demand. This suggests a potential reversal or significant struggle upcoming.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Resistance/Climax: 29.79, Support: 25.50 (Low of previous week), Prior Accumulation Level: 20.80

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on a confirmed weekly close below $27.53, or a No Demand test near $29.00.
- **Invalidation:** $29.79 (Break and hold above climax high)
---
### BND (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Low Volatility)

**Smart Money Logic:**
BND operates in a tight range. While the weekly sequence signals SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (WATCH_FOR_TEST), the price action is inconclusive. The last bar has a narrow spread (0.31) and closes poorly (CLV -0.74) on high volume (RelVol 1.88). The high volume suggests heavy selling pressure/liquidation, but the narrow spread keeps it contained. Given its bond ETF nature, this suggests ongoing distribution within a tight range, but lacks breakout confirmation.

**Key Levels:** Tight Range Support: 74.16, Tight Range Resistance: 74.47, Major Support: 73.77

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Clear break and retest of $74.47 (resistance) or $74.16 (support) on confirming volume.
- **Invalidation:** $74.48 (Breakout of resistance)
---
### BNS (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Rally Failure / Effort No Result

**Smart Money Logic:**
The latest weekly bar is a wide spread up bar (1.99) with above-average volume (RelVol 1.40) but closes well off the high (CLV 0.70). This suggests significant selling pressure absorbed the demand, representing a minor Effort No Result. This comes after a sharp drop last week (Supply Dominance). The high volume confirms professional activity, keeping the price contained. Quarterly trend is bullish, but weekly supply is present.

**Key Levels:** Support: 71.76, Resistance: 73.76, Supply Zone: 74.50

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $73.76 on high volume for bullish continuation, or close below $72.00 for bearish momentum.
- **Invalidation:** $71.76 (Break below recent low)
---
### BP (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Rally Failure / Supply Absorption

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence signals SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The latest bar is a wide spread up (2.23) on very high volume (RelVol 1.51), but the close is mediocre (CLV 0.18). This high volume with poor result suggests significant supply is being met on the rally (Effort No Result). This is occurring within a Quarterly BEARISH_TREND, making the presence of supply dangerous for the bulls.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 36.29 (High of bar), Support: 34.06 (Low of bar), Major Resistance: 37.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and hold above $36.30 on increasing volume (Bullish), or failure to hold $35.00 (Bearish).
- **Invalidation:** $34.06 (Break below recent low on high volume)
---
### BRBR (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Accumulation?

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly sequence shows SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The last weekly bar is a wide spread down (2.86) on high volume (RelVol 1.38), but the CLV is positive (0.56), indicating a strong push off the low. This could be Stopping Volume attempting to absorb the heavy supply from the prior two weeks. The context is BEARISH_TREND, so caution is warranted, but the strong close suggests demand is re-entering.

**Key Levels:** Support/Stopping Zone: 21.67, Resistance: 24.53, Prior Supply Zone: 26.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Weekly close above $24.53 with confirming volume (Bullish). Short if price breaks $21.67.
- **Invalidation:** $21.67 (Break below accumulation low)
---
### BSY (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Rally Failure / Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly sequence signals SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The last weekly bar is a wide spread down (1.93) closing poorly (CLV -0.57) on above-average volume (RelVol 1.21). This move followed a strong rally last week (CLV 0.63), suggesting the demand was met by supply, reversing the momentum. This confirms supply is active in the $40 zone, consistent with the BEARISH_TREND Quarterly context.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 40.65, Immediate Support: 38.72, Previous Low: 37.70

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close below $38.72 (recent low) on increasing volume for short continuation.
- **Invalidation:** $40.66 (Break above recent high)
---
### BWA (NEUTRAL (Slight Bearish Bias))
**VSA Status:** Confirmed Buying Climax / Pullback

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Weekly sequence is CONFIRMED_STRONG BUYING_CLIMAX. The latest bar is a wide spread down (2.06) on strong volume (RelVol 0.95), closing poorly (CLV -0.55). This indicates supply entering the market following the climax high. Although the Quarterly trend is BULLISH, this large supply candle demands caution and suggests a necessary correction or test of demand.

**Key Levels:** Climax High: 48.79, Support Test Zone: 46.70, Previous Support: 44.90

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Watch for a low volume test (No Supply) around $46.00-$47.00 for a long entry. Short if $46.70 is broken on high volume.
- **Invalidation:** $48.80 (New high indicating climax failed)
---
### CADE (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Effort to Rise (Weakening)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly sequence signals BUYING_CLIMAX (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The latest weekly bar is a wide spread up (2.09) on high volume (RelVol 1.29), but the close is relatively weak (CLV 0.64), not near the absolute high. This suggests some supply is entering the market, causing the price to retreat from the high ($44.86). This is an Effort to Rise with decreasing result, indicating distribution is present near the high of the range.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 44.86, Support: 42.77, Climax Zone: 46.02

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and hold above $44.87 (Bullish) or breakdown below $43.00 on volume (Bearish).
- **Invalidation:** $42.77 (Break below recent low)
---
### CAI (NEUTRAL (Slight Bearish Bias))
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Failed Rally

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Weekly signal is STOPPING_VOLUME (WATCH_FOR_TEST). After a strong Stopping Volume event two weeks ago, the latest bar is a very wide spread down (4.31) on extreme volume (RelVol 2.32), closing near the low (CLV -0.03). This high volume down bar completely negates the stopping action and suggests Smart Money liquidated heavily into any demand. Although technically not closing at the low, the volume is alarming, signaling aggressive selling.

**Key Levels:** Supply Zone: 28.80 - 29.00, Support/Accumulation: 24.69, Resistance: 29.31

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on break below $24.69 on volume. Long entry only on a clear No Supply test above $26.00.
- **Invalidation:** $29.00 (Break above recent high)
---
### CDW (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Distribution

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Weekly chart confirms SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The latest bar is a wide spread down (5.64) closing in the lower half (CLV -0.53) on high volume (RelVol 1.12). This follows a massive drop two weeks prior. The high volume selling suggests strong professional liquidation, confirmed by the overall BEARISH_TREND Quarterly context. Demand is struggling to hold ground.

**Key Levels:** Supply Zone: 136.08, Resistance: 132.86 (Open of bar), Target Support: 126.93

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Daily close below $130.44 on volume. Failed rally (No Demand) towards $134.00.
- **Invalidation:** $136.09 (Break above recent high)
---
### CELC (NEUTRAL (Slight Bearish Bias))
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result (Failed Rally)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly sequence confirmed SUPPLY_DOMINANCE, suggesting Smart Money is distributing. The latest weekly bar is a wide spread up (16.06) on average volume (RelVol 0.65), but the close is weak (CLV -0.18). This is a strong EFFORT NO RESULT bar, indicating institutional selling absorbed the rally, confirming the monthly distribution narrative. Although the Quarterly trend is Bullish, the supply presence is immediate.

**Key Levels:** Supply/Resistance: 116.44, Support: 104.00 (Open of bar), Low Volume Test Zone: 100.37

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on close below $106.95, or a No Demand test near $112.00.
- **Invalidation:** $116.44 (Break above high, signaling supply absorption failure)
---
### CRBG (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Confirmed Supply Dominance / Consolidation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Weekly chart confirms SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (CONFIRMED_STRONG). The latest bar is a narrow spread down (0.93) closing slightly off the low (CLV 0.08) on above-average volume (RelVol 1.04). This suggests continued selling pressure but the range is tightening, indicating consolidation after the sharp drop two weeks ago. The price is resting at the lower range, suggesting supply still dominates but lacks momentum for a strong immediate breakdown.

**Key Levels:** Supply Zone: 30.92, Immediate Support: 29.98, Breakdown Target: 29.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and hold below $29.98 on volume for short entry. Long entry only on break above $31.00.
- **Invalidation:** $30.92 (High of the consolidation range)
---
### CTRA (NEUTRAL (Slight Bearish Bias))
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Pullback

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Weekly sequence signals BUYING_CLIMAX (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The latest bar is a very wide spread down (3.79) on extreme volume (RelVol 2.47), but the close is mediocre (CLV -0.45). This high volume with a pull-off the low suggests massive two-way action: sellers driving price down but finding demand absorbing it near the close. Given the recent climax signal, this is likely a violent distribution/shakeout event within a consolidation phase. Quarterly trend is BEARISH.

**Key Levels:** Supply Zone: 28.47, Support/Demand Zone: 24.68, Climax Low: 25.14

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on break below $24.68. Long entry only if price establishes support above $25.70 with low volume test.
- **Invalidation:** $28.48 (Break above supply high)
---
### DOW (NEUTRAL (Slight Bullish Bias))
**VSA Status:** Effort to Rise / Distribution

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly sequence confirmed SUPPLY_DOMINANCE, but the weekly trend shows strength. The latest bar is a wide spread up (2.45) on high volume (RelVol 1.21), but the close is mediocre (CLV 0.22), showing EFFORT NO RESULT into the rally high. This suggests supply is entering the market, likely selling into the strong move up from the previous week. While demand pushed price higher, it met resistance.

**Key Levels:** Resistance/Supply: 28.52, Support: 26.06, Prior Accumulation: 24.18

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and hold above $28.52 on strong volume (Bullish). Short if price falls below $27.00 on heavy volume.
- **Invalidation:** $26.06 (Break below consolidation low)
---
### ENR (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result (Supply Confirmation)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly sequence confirmed SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The latest weekly bar is a wide spread down (1.43) closing poorly (CLV -0.70) on above-average volume (RelVol 1.02). This bar follows a strong rally (Effort to Rise with CLV 0.98), suggesting that the recent demand was met by supply, resulting in a reversal (Effort No Result). This confirms institutional supply is active, pushing the price lower, despite the Quarterly BULLISH_TREND.

**Key Levels:** Supply Zone: 21.89, Support: 20.46, Target: 19.70

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close below $20.46 on volume. Short entry on failed rally (No Demand) towards $21.50.
- **Invalidation:** $21.90 (Break above supply high)
---
### FFIV (NEUTRAL (Slight Bearish Bias))
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Effort No Result

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Weekly chart signals SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The latest bar is a wide spread up (16.17) on very high volume (RelVol 1.70), but the close is weak (CLV -0.54). This is a strong EFFORT NO RESULT bar, suggesting massive institutional selling absorbed the rally, confirming supply dominance despite the bullish quarterly context. Smart Money is distributing into the move.

**Key Levels:** Supply Zone: 280.75, Support: 264.57, Target: 260.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on close below $268.22 or a confirmed No Demand test near $275.00.
- **Invalidation:** $280.75 (Break and hold above high of supply bar)
---
### FNF (NEUTRAL (Slight Bullish Bias))
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Upthrust Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Weekly chart signals STOPPING_VOLUME (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The latest bar is a wide spread down (3.75) on high volume (RelVol 1.81), but it closed strong (CLV 0.09) after a major shakeout to the low ($50.81). The price was successfully driven up off the low by demand. This suggests Smart Money absorption is occurring at these lower levels, attempting to reverse the Quarterly BEARISH_TREND.

**Key Levels:** Accumulation/Spring Low: 50.81, Immediate Resistance: 54.56, Target: 56.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and hold above $54.56 on volume. Long entry on a clean pullback (No Supply) toward $52.00.
- **Invalidation:** $50.81 (Break below spring low)
---
### GEN (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume Failure / Supply Confirmed

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Weekly chart signals STOPPING_VOLUME (CONFIRMED_EARLY), yet the follow-through is poor. The latest bar is a narrow spread down (1.00) closing near the absolute low (CLV -0.79) on high volume (RelVol 1.13). This indicates supply overwhelmed demand quickly. The failure to rally or hold support after the initial stopping volume suggests that distribution is still active, aligning with the Quarterly BEARISH_TREND.

**Key Levels:** Supply Zone: 27.00, Immediate Support: 26.00, Target: 25.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close below $26.00 on volume. Short entry on failed rally (No Demand) towards $26.80.
- **Invalidation:** $27.00 (High of recent consolidation)
---
### GKOS (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Effort vs. Result

**Smart Money Logic:**
The latest weekly bar shows ultra-high volume on a wide up bar closing near the high (CLV 0.899). While strong demand, following the monthly BUYING_CLIMAX alert, this massive volume spike suggests exhaustion and potential Smart Money distribution into retail euphoria around 121.63.

**Key Levels:** 121.63 (Climax High), 112.11 (Immediate Support), 109.33 (Prior Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry below 110.72 upon confirmed secondary distribution/No Demand.
- **Invalidation:** 121.63
---
### GNTX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax / Sign of Weakness (SOW)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Ultra-high volume on a wide down bar closing on the low (CLV -0.017) confirms significant selling pressure/distribution. This aligns with the Monthly Supply Dominance alert and suggests the end of the rally, initiating a markdown phase.

**Key Levels:** 24.45 (Immediate Resistance), 24.80 (Supply High), 23.35 (W1 Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry upon failure to hold 24.00 resistance/Confirmed No Demand test below 24.45.
- **Invalidation:** 24.80
---
### GWRE (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax (SC)

**Smart Money Logic:**
A massive spread down bar on Ultra High Volume (RelVol 2.35) closing at the extreme low (CLV -0.985) confirms a Selling Climax. This indicates a final liquidation event (panic) and marks a potential low for a new accumulation range in this bearish context.

**Key Levels:** 158.80 (SC Low), 185.07 (SC High/Automatic Rally potential), 187.63 (Prior Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Long entry after a successful Secondary Test (ST) that holds above 158.80, confirmed by No Supply.
- **Invalidation:** 158.80
---
### HDB (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Confirmation / Secondary Weakness

**Smart Money Logic:**
Following a major Selling Climax (W2), W1 exhibits high volume selling, leading to a down bar closing poorly. This confirms continued supply dominance and failure to stabilize, suggesting the markdown phase is still active or continuing toward lower accumulation levels.

**Key Levels:** 33.59 (Immediate Resistance), 32.97 (SC Low), 32.29 (W1 Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry upon break below 32.29 (W1 low).
- **Invalidation:** 35.80
---
### HPE (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Sign of Weakness (SOW) / Continued Markdown

**Smart Money Logic:**
Despite monthly Stopping Volume signals, the last two weekly bars are wide down moves on high volume, confirming aggressive selling. W1 closed at the extreme low (CLV -0.969), showing sellers remain decisively in control and pushing the price into a markdown.

**Key Levels:** 22.71 (Immediate Resistance), 24.34 (Key Supply Zone), 21.42 (New Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on break below 21.42.
- **Invalidation:** 23.00
---
### HRMY (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result (Up) followed by immediate Sign of Weakness (SOW)

**Smart Money Logic:**
A strong buying effort (W2 SOS) was immediately negated by a wide down bar (W1) on high volume, closing poorly. This suggests Smart Money utilized the rally to distribute, confirming active supply near the recent highs (39.40), aligning with the monthly Supply Dominance warning.

**Key Levels:** 39.40 (Resistance), 37.18 (Immediate Support), 34.68 (Key Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry below 36.22 upon confirmed break of 35.42 (W4 low).
- **Invalidation:** 39.40
---
### IONQ (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result (Up) / Supply Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
W1 saw a significant rally effort on high volume (0.897) but failed to close strongly near the high (CLV 0.513). This suggests supply is still present and absorbing demand around 51-52, aligning with the structural risk flagged by the monthly Buying Climax.

**Key Levels:** 52.61 (Resistance), 47.33 (Support), 55.60 (Climax High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on failure below 50.00 if confirmed No Demand appears.
- **Invalidation:** 52.61
---
### JPM (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax (SC) / Sign of Weakness (SOW)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Ultra-high volume (2.23) on an ultra wide down bar closing poorly signals a major Selling Climax or shakeout. This indicates potential capitulation by weak holders, setting a low (306.12) for a potential accumulation range.

**Key Levels:** 306.12 (SC Low), 321.88 (Immediate Resistance), 335.73 (Major Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Long entry after successful Secondary Test (ST) that holds above 306.12, confirmed by No Supply.
- **Invalidation:** 306.12
---
### KVYO (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax (SC) / Failure of Initial Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
The rally attempt following the W2 Stopping Volume failed. W1 is a wide down bar on high volume, closing on the extreme low (CLV -0.967), setting a new SC low (23.74). This confirms strong bearish control and continued markdown pressure.

**Key Levels:** 23.74 (New SC Low), 28.28 (Immediate Resistance), 27.26 (Previous SC Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Long entry only after confirmed Automatic Rally and successful Secondary Test (ST) above 23.74.
- **Invalidation:** 23.74
---
### KYMR (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Sign of Weakness (SOW) / Continued Markdown

**Smart Money Logic:**
W1 is a wide down bar on high volume (0.846) closing at the extreme low (CLV -0.963), breaking the prior week's low. This signals persistent supply and continuation of the markdown phase, confirming the monthly Buying Climax was distribution.

**Key Levels:** 74.26 (Immediate Resistance), 81.04 (Key Resistance), 69.40 (New Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry below 69.40 (W1 low).
- **Invalidation:** 76.71
---
### MNDY (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax (SC) / Profound Sign of Weakness

**Smart Money Logic:**
W1 is an ultra wide down bar on Ultra High Volume (1.90), closing at the extreme low (CLV -0.972). This catastrophic drop suggests extreme liquidation and market capitulation, establishing a potential Selling Climax low at 126.41.

**Key Levels:** 126.41 (SC Low), 147.38 (Immediate Resistance), 142.08 (Prior Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Long entry after confirmed ST above 126.41 and clear No Supply.
- **Invalidation:** 126.41
---
### MOD (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Automatic Rally (AR) following Selling Climax (SC)

**Smart Money Logic:**
W2 was a massive Selling Climax (Ultra High Volume, wide spread). W1 followed with a strong rally on high volume, closing near the high (CLV 0.707). This is a strong Automatic Rally confirming Smart Money accumulation following capitulation.

**Key Levels:** 111.18 (SC Low), 122.87 (Immediate Support), 139.39 (AR High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Long entry on a confirmed Secondary Test (ST) or No Supply test near 125.00.
- **Invalidation:** 122.21
---
### OC (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Confirmed Sign of Strength (SOS) / Markup continuation

**Smart Money Logic:**
Following a successful SOS (W2), W1 continued the markup on high volume, sustaining the price above previous resistance (121.77). This confirms committed professional buying and continuation of the bullish phase, overriding prior Stopping Volume concerns.

**Key Levels:** 121.30 (Immediate Support), 114.00 (Breakout Support), 126.08 (Target Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Long entry on shallow pullback/No Supply test towards 122.00.
- **Invalidation:** 120.39
---
### ONB (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Upward Movement into Supply / Final Push

**Smart Money Logic:**
Despite a confirmed strong monthly Supply Dominance, the weekly bars show demand persisting, pushing the price towards the high (23.75). W1 closed moderately well on high volume. We are watching for the failure of this demand or a decisive break through supply.

**Key Levels:** 23.75 (Resistance), 23.00 (Immediate Support), 22.45 (Key Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry upon confirmed No Demand test near 23.50.
- **Invalidation:** 23.75
---
### PSN (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Sign of Strength (SOS) / Markup

**Smart Money Logic:**
W2 and W1 show decisive buying volume driving the price up strongly through resistance, despite the bearish quarterly context. W1 closed very high (CLV 0.828), indicating demand is currently dominant and initiating a markup phase.

**Key Levels:** 70.02 (Immediate Support), 62.81 (Breakout Support), 72.81 (Target Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Long entry on pullback/No Supply test towards 70.00.
- **Invalidation:** 68.85
---
### RGTI (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Neutral Test / Consolidation

**Smart Money Logic:**
Following weakness and a rally attempt, W1 showed a moderate up bar on slightly above-average volume, resulting in a central close. This suggests consolidation and testing is ongoing. Demand is present but not decisive enough to overcome the structural monthly Buying Climax risk.

**Key Levels:** 26.70 (Resistance), 24.72 (Immediate Support), 23.76 (Major Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Long on sustained break above 26.70; Short on breakdown below 23.76.
- **Invalidation:** 23.76
---
### SPOT (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax (SC) / Extreme Sign of Weakness

**Smart Money Logic:**
W1 and W2 are consecutive weeks of extreme markdown pressure, with W1 showing Ultra High Volume (2.30) and an extreme low close (CLV -0.845), setting a new low. This is a severe Selling Climax event, suggesting capitulation and marking a potential accumulation bottom (500.82).

**Key Levels:** 500.82 (SC Low), 539.46 (Immediate Resistance), 580.00 (Major Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Long entry after confirmed ST above 500.82 and clear No Supply.
- **Invalidation:** 500.82
---
### STAA (NEUTRAL-BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly chart shows a massive spike in volume (14.96M, RelVol 2.72) two weeks ago on a wide down bar (4.44 spread) that closed poorly (CLV 0.036). This is Stopping Volume, indicating Smart Money absorption during a major shakeout, especially since the quarterly trend is BEARISH. The subsequent week (last week) saw high volume (11.26M, RelVol 1.91) but on a slightly narrower spread, closing off the lows (CLV -0.04), which is a possible follow-through test or temporary weakness before a reaction. We need confirmation of demand.

**Key Levels:** 24.26 (Immediate Resistance/Top of Stopping Bar), 19.82 (Stopping Volume Low), 22.12 (Last Week Open)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Weekly close above $24.26 (confirming absorption) or a successful test of the $20.00 area on ultra-low volume.
- **Invalidation:** $19.39 (Below the recent low)
---
### STT (NEUTRAL-BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
In a BULLISH quarterly trend, the last weekly bar showed significant Supply Dominance. The spread was very wide (9.12), and volume was extremely high (17.57M, RelVol 1.81), closing at the absolute low (CLV -0.98). This suggests massive distribution or a sharp shakeout (often a sign of weakness in a prior bull move). The monthly chart also closed with high volume and a poor CLV (-0.80). This heavy supply requires an immediate test or confirmation of support before resuming the uptrend.

**Key Levels:** 137.05 (Recent High/Selling Climax), 127.93 (Recent Weekly Low), 132.57 (Support broken)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A subsequent week showing a clear sign of strength (SoS) or a successful No Demand Test on low volume near $128.00.
- **Invalidation:** $137.05 (Above the recent high, confirming supply failure)
---
### TFX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
TFX is in a BEARISH quarterly trend. The last two weekly bars show heavy distribution. Two weeks ago, volume was extremely high (6.28M, RelVol 1.97) on a massive spread (19.09), closing near the low (CLV -0.53). Last week confirmed this weakness with another wide bar (10.22 spread) on high volume (6.08M, RelVol 1.81), closing near the absolute low (CLV -0.93), which is a clear sign of persistent Supply Dominance driving the price down. The monthly bar reinforces this with an ugly CLV of -0.97.

**Key Levels:** 112.90 (Recent Resistance), 102.68 (Recent Low/Support Test), 127.49 (Top of Selling Wave)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A move below $102.68 (recent low) confirming the markdown, or a failed rally (No Demand bar) near $108.00.
- **Invalidation:** $115.00 (Failure of supply to push lower)
---
### UBSI (NEUTRAL-BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
UBSI is in a BULLISH quarterly trend. The last weekly bar, a clear Up bar (open 40.33, close 41.22) on high volume (5.09M, RelVol 1.42), closed high (CLV 0.67). This follows a sharp move up two weeks prior (CLV 0.80). While the volume is high, suggesting potential profit-taking (Buying Climax), the close is strong, and the spread is narrow/moderate, indicating demand absorbed any immediate selling. A minor reversal or test is expected soon, but the underlying demand remains strong.

**Key Levels:** 41.53 (Recent High/Supply Zone), 39.63 (Immediate Support), 38.21 (Prior Launch Point)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Successful low-volume No Supply test confirming the recent high volume bar was genuine strength, or a sustained breakout above $41.53.
- **Invalidation:** $39.63 (Below the low of the last weekly bar)
---
### USIG (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
USIG operates in an extremely tight range, typical for an ETF/bond-proxy, making VSA difficult, though the quarterly trend is BULLISH. The last week had the highest volume (22.76M, RelVol 2.61) on a narrow spread (0.31), closing poorly (CLV -0.41). This signals Supply Dominance, suggesting profit-taking or weakness near the range high ($52.12). Since the spread is so tight, this might simply be a 'churn' bar indicating lack of easy upward movement.

**Key Levels:** 52.12 (Range Resistance), 51.81 (Immediate Support), 51.50 (Lower Range Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A clear break above $52.12 with volume, or a significant drop below $51.50.
- **Invalidation:** $52.12 (If demand fails to overcome this resistance)
---
### VGLT (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
VGLT is in a BEARISH quarterly trend. Last week showed high volume (18.89M, RelVol 1.88) on a moderate spread (0.69), closing poorly (CLV -0.53). This confirms the weakness seen two weeks prior. In a bearish environment, high volume on a down-close suggests supply is overcoming demand, though the overall spread is tight, indicating low volatility and possibly institutional neutrality in this bond proxy.

**Key Levels:** 56.60 (Resistance), 55.91 (Immediate Support/Prior Low), 55.61 (Major Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $55.91 confirming the supply pressure, or a clear Sign of Strength (SoS) above $56.30.
- **Invalidation:** $56.60 (Close above the recent high, nullifying supply thesis)
---
### VONG (NEUTRAL-BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
In a BEARISH quarterly trend, the last weekly bar showed very high volume (25.69M, RelVol 2.81) on a moderate down bar (3.15 spread), closing poorly (CLV -0.32). This is heavy selling/supply dominance. Furthermore, the monthly chart shows Stopping Volume, suggesting a massive battle is underway. The bearish weekly bar, despite the monthly stopping volume, indicates supply is winning the short-term fight, pushing the price back down toward the accumulation zone.

**Key Levels:** 123.18 (Immediate Resistance), 120.03 (Key Accumulation Zone Low), 121.09 (Current Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A successful test of the $120.03 low on ultra-low volume, or a decisive break and hold above $123.59.
- **Invalidation:** $123.18 (If price fails to break past this weekly resistance immediately)
---
### WFC (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
WFC is in a BULLISH quarterly trend, but the last weekly bar shows a dramatic shakeout/distribution event. Volume was extremely high (140.87M, RelVol 1.96) on the widest spread (7.69), closing near the absolute low (CLV -0.91). This is extreme Supply Dominance, indicating a deep shakeout or aggressive institutional distribution at higher levels. Given the sheer scale of the volume, this must be respected as professional selling or a massive institutional shakeout.

**Key Levels:** 95.95 (Prior Support, now Resistance), 88.06 (Shakeout Low), 97.76 (Recent High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A low volume rally (No Demand bar) failing near $92.00, or a break below the $88.06 low.
- **Invalidation:** $95.95 (If price recovers swiftly back above prior support on good volume)
---
### WKC (NEUTRAL-BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
WKC is in a strong BULLISH quarterly trend. Two weeks ago showed a large spread (2.89) on high volume (5.79M, RelVol 1.49), closing very high (CLV 0.77), indicative of Buying Climax or major Sign of Strength (SoS). Last week followed up with high volume (7.73M, RelVol 1.88) but a much narrower spread (1.23) and a mediocre close (CLV 0.08). This behavior confirms that Smart Money is likely distributing into the strength, even though the close is still up. A test or reversal is imminent.

**Key Levels:** 28.16 (Recent High/Climax Top), 26.93 (Immediate Support), 24.50 (Prior Accumulation Zone)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A failure of the price to hold above $27.00, confirming the distribution, or a clear breakout above $28.16 on confirming volume.
- **Invalidation:** $26.93 (Close below the low of the last two strong weeks)
---
### WRB (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Monthly Supply Dominance (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
WRB is facing strong Supply Dominance pressure within a BEARISH quarterly context. The monthly chart confirmed significant supply. The last two weekly bars show persistent weakness: wide spreads and closes near the lows (CLV -0.73 and -0.71, respectively) on high relative volume (1.00 and 0.97). This indicates the price is failing to hold its footing, suggesting a continuation of the markdown phase.

**Key Levels:** 71.18 (Recent Resistance), 67.57 (Immediate Low/Potential Test), 68.81 (Prior Open)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A break below $67.57 on confirming volume, or a failed low-volume rally (No Demand) towards $69.00.
- **Invalidation:** $71.18 (Above the last major resistance high)
---
### ZBH (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
ZBH is in a BEARISH quarterly trend. The last weekly bar saw very high volume (17.83M, RelVol 1.95) on a wide down spread (7.86), closing near the absolute low (CLV -0.60). This is strong confirmation of Supply Dominance and professional selling pressure, following the failure to break out above $95.32 two weeks prior. The monthly chart confirms heavy distribution at the beginning of the year.

**Key Levels:** 93.62 (Immediate Resistance), 85.76 (Recent Low/Support Test), 95.32 (Top of Selling Wave)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and hold below $85.76, confirming the markdown phase. Alternatively, a failed rally (No Demand) toward $90.00.
- **Invalidation:** $93.62 (A clear break above the recent high, nullifying supply thesis)
