## 🚀 Ready for Entry
### BIRK (BEARISH (Significant selling pressure))
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Effort No Result Down)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BEARISH. The last weekly bar is a wide spread down (6.46) closing near the absolute low (CLV -0.916) on significantly high volume (RelVol 1.84). This is a strong sign of Supply Dominance and potential panic selling (Effort No Result Down). The monthly bar also confirms this extreme weakness (CLV -0.919, high spread). Smart money is aggressively distributing or initiating short positions, pushing price to new lows (38.20).

**Key Levels:** 44.66 (Short-term Resistance), 38.20 (New Low/Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 38.20 (New 52-week low) on volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 41.97 (Breaching recent consolidation)
---
### BNS (BULLISH (Supply absorption confirmed by reversal))
**VSA Status:** Effort to Rise (Absorption of Supply)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The second to last weekly bar (Jan 5) was a wide spread down (3.34) closing near the low (CLV -0.60) on huge volume (RelVol 1.88), indicating massive supply. However, the last weekly bar is a medium spread up (1.99), closing very strong (CLV 0.70) on high volume (RelVol 1.40). This is classic behavior: high volume selling (Jan 5) followed immediately by high volume buying (Jan 12), suggesting the sellers were absorbed, leading to a strong reversal close. Quarterly trend is BULLISH.

**Key Levels:** 74.97 (Prior High/Resistance), 71.63 (Accumulation Low/Key Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 73.76 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 71.63 (Failure of absorption)
---
### BOX (BEARISH (Extreme supply confirmed))
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Selling Climax)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BEARISH, and the weekly SUPPLY_DOMINANCE is reinforced. The last weekly bar is a very wide spread down (4.01) closing at the absolute low (CLV -0.987) on extremely high volume (RelVol 1.98). This is a definitive sign of panic selling or major institutional distribution, hitting a new low (25.82). This confirms sellers are firmly in control.

**Key Levels:** 29.73 (Immediate Resistance), 25.82 (New Low/Selling Climax)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 25.82, or short entry on a failure of a reaction rally back to 27.50.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 29.00 (Breaching recent heavy supply zone)
---
### BRBR (BULLISH (Immediate sign of demand))
**VSA Status:** Effort to Rise (Supply Absorption)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH, but the recent weekly action shows a decisive demand response. The last weekly bar is a medium spread up (2.86) closing strong (CLV 0.56) on high volume (RelVol 1.38). This occurs after several weeks of downward pressure hitting new lows (21.67). This suggests institutional buying stepping in and absorbing selling pressure at a critical monthly low, despite the overall monthly SUPPLY_DOMINANCE context.

**Key Levels:** 24.53 (Immediate Resistance), 21.67 (Accumulation Low/Key Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry on retest of 23.50 or break above 24.53.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 21.67 (Failure of demand)
---
### BRKR (BEARISH (Failure at new high on very high volume))
**VSA Status:** Up-Thrust/Distribution

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly context signaled STOPPING_VOLUME, indicating a potential Accumulation/Distribution zone. The last weekly bar is extremely important: a wide spread down (8.38) closing near the absolute low (CLV -0.86) on high volume (RelVol 1.21). This bar attempted to make a new high (56.22) but immediately collapsed, resulting in a severe Up-thrust bar. This confirms significant institutional distribution at the highs, invalidating the bullish implications of the prior move and reinforcing the Quarterly BEARISH_TREND.

**Key Levels:** 56.22 (Up-thrust High/Resistance), 47.84 (Key Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below the low of the rejection bar (47.84) on volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 55.00 (Failure to distribute)
---
### BRZE (BEARISH (Confirmed severe breakdown))
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Selling Climax)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH, supported by a confirmed monthly BUYING_CLIMAX failure. The last weekly bar is catastrophic: a very wide spread down (7.58) closing at the absolute low (CLV -0.956) on massive volume (RelVol 2.09). This is a textbook Selling Climax/panic sell-off, shattering all immediate support levels. Institutional players are aggressively liquidating positions.

**Key Levels:** 29.97 (Immediate Resistance), 22.86 (New Low/Selling Climax)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on break below 22.86, or wait for a failed test of the 25.00 level.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 29.97 (Absorption of selling pressure)
---
### BSX (BEARISH (Extreme supply confirmed))
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Selling Climax)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH. The last weekly bar is a wide spread down (10.68) closing near the absolute low (CLV -0.84) on massive volume (RelVol 1.81). This massive supply event confirms that sellers have taken control following the attempted rally to 100.90 (Jan 5). This is likely institutional distribution or a massive shakeout, driving the price towards new lows.

**Key Levels:** 97.90 (Immediate Resistance/Last Open), 87.22 (New Low/Selling Climax)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 87.22 on high volume, confirming breakdown.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 95.00 (Overcoming recent supply)
---
### BSY (BEARISH (Continued weakness))
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Effort No Result Down)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH, aligning with the monthly SUPPLY_DOMINANCE sequence. The last weekly bar is a medium spread down (1.93) closing poorly (CLV -0.57) on high volume (RelVol 1.21). This is 'Effort No Result Down'—despite the effort (volume/spread), the close remains weak, confirming sustained institutional selling pressure near the lows. The last rally attempt (Jan 5, high CLV 0.63) failed to hold gains.

**Key Levels:** 40.66 (Resistance), 38.73 (Immediate Support), 37.70 (Critical Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 38.73 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 40.03 (Overcoming recent supply)
---
### BWA (BEARISH (Demand failure at highs))
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax Failure / Rejection

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence is confirmed as a STRONG BUYING_CLIMAX. The last weekly bar is a narrow-medium spread down (2.07) closing poorly (CLV -0.55) on elevated volume (RelVol 0.95). This bar failed to follow through on the preceding high-volume rally (Jan 5), indicating institutional distribution or major profit-taking into the demand. The close below the open, despite the volume, suggests supply is dominating at the top of the range.

**Key Levels:** 48.80 (Climax High/Resistance), 46.73 (Key Support), 45.00 (Strong Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 46.73 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 48.80 (Absorption of supply)
---
### BWIN (BULLISH (Strength overcoming distribution))
**VSA Status:** Effort to Rise (Demand Confirmation)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly context warns of SUPPLY_DOMINANCE, but the last two weeks contradict this. The last weekly bar is a narrow-medium spread up (2.35) closing strong (CLV 0.68) on high volume (RelVol 1.36). This follows a previous strong up week (Jan 5, CLV 0.56). The consistent high volume on up closes indicates aggressive institutional accumulation and absorption of the monthly supply. The price is challenging the high end of the recent volatility range.

**Key Levels:** 27.01 (Resistance), 25.92 (Immediate Support), 24.66 (Strong Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 27.01 on sustained volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 24.66 (Failure of accumulation)
---
### CAI (BEARISH (Failure to rally after stopping volume))
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result Down (Supply confirmed)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence signals STOPPING_VOLUME (Jan 5: high volume up). However, the last weekly bar is a wide spread down (4.31) closing near the low (CLV -0.03) on massive volume (RelVol 2.32). This bar wiped out the gains of the prior stopping volume bar, strongly suggesting that the prior week was Absorption of Supply followed immediately by Supply Dominance (distribution/heavy selling). The quarterly trend is BEARISH.

**Key Levels:** 29.00 (Resistance), 24.69 (New Low/Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 24.69 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 28.80 (Negating recent distribution)
---
### CALM (BULLISH (Strong sign of demand/reversal))
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Reversal

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH, but the weekly sequence suggests a major change. The last weekly bar is a wide spread up (6.07) closing near the absolute high (CLV 0.976) on high volume (RelVol 2.07). This follows a Selling Climax bar (Jan 5, CLV -0.769, high volume). This VSA signature is textbook reversal/Stopping Volume, where the immediate demand overcomes the preceding panic selling.

**Key Levels:** 77.99 (Immediate Resistance/Close), 71.92 (Stopping Volume Low/Key Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry on retest of 75.00 or break above 78.00.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 71.92 (Failure of accumulation)
---
### CBSH (BULLISH (Strength confirmed))
**VSA Status:** Effort to Rise (Demand Confirmation)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is a medium spread up (2.26) closing strongly (CLV 0.318) on high volume (RelVol 1.35). This follows a successful test of support near 51.97 (Jan 5 low). The current action shows professional money moving the price higher, overcoming the modest SUPPLY_DOMINANCE indicated by the monthly context. The price structure is consolidating demand.

**Key Levels:** 55.06 (Resistance), 53.58 (Immediate Support/Last Open), 51.97 (Key Accumulation Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 55.06 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 52.80 (Breaking recent accumulation low)
---
### CDW (BEARISH (Continued supply pressure))
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Failure to Rally

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH, reinforced by the weekly SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The last weekly bar is a medium spread down (5.65) closing poorly (CLV -0.536) on high volume (RelVol 1.12). This follows a high volume rejection from the low (Jan 5, CLV 0.47), indicating that demand was unable to hold the gains. Sellers stepped back in aggressively, pushing the price back toward the lows (130.44). The failure of the rally confirms the supply context.

**Key Levels:** 136.09 (Resistance), 130.44 (Key Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 130.44 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 136.09 (Absorption of supply)
---
### CEG (BEARISH (Confirmed severe breakdown))
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Effort No Result Down)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH, reinforced by the weekly SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The last weekly bar is a very wide spread down (46.40) closing near the absolute low (CLV -0.685) on extremely high volume (RelVol 2.20). This represents massive institutional distribution and confirms a severe breakdown, shattering previous support levels. This is 'Effort No Result Down' for smart money seeking support, but for VSA signals, it is extreme weakness.

**Key Levels:** 334.67 (Immediate Resistance), 300.41 (New Low/Key Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 300.41 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 346.81 (Negating recent distribution)
---
### CMPO (BULLISH (Extreme absorption confirmed by volume spike))
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Up-thrust

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is a wide spread up (5.80) closing strong (CLV 0.71) on massive volume (RelVol 3.85). This volume spike is extreme, indicating institutional interest. Although classified as SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (WATCH_FOR_TEST) weekly, this explosive demand response, driving the price from 20.15 to 25.95 and closing high, suggests significant absorption of prior selling. This bar is a strong sign of demand, potentially breaking out of accumulation or a re-accumulation phase.

**Key Levels:** 25.95 (Resistance/High), 21.75 (Immediate Support/Last Open), 20.15 (Key Accumulation Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry on minor pullback or break above 25.95 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 21.75 (Failure of demand)
---
### CNQ (BULLISH (Strength confirmed after shakeout))
**VSA Status:** Effort to Rise (Demand Confirmation)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence signals STOPPING_VOLUME (Jan 5: wide spread down, high volume shakeout, CLV 0.35). The last weekly bar is a wide spread up (3.04) closing very strong (CLV 0.605) on high volume (RelVol 1.53). This sequence confirms that the previous selling was a shakeout, absorbed by professional money, and the price is now moving higher decisively. Quarterly trend is BULLISH.

**Key Levels:** 34.95 (Resistance), 32.28 (Immediate Support/Last Open), 31.91 (Key Accumulation Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 34.95 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 31.91 (Failure of accumulation)
---
### CNXC (BULLISH (Strength confirmed after shakeout))
**VSA Status:** Effort to Rise (Demand Confirmation)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence signals STOPPING_VOLUME (Jan 5: wide spread up, high volume, CLV 0.65). The last weekly bar is a wide spread down (6.02) closing very strong (CLV 0.76) on high volume (RelVol 2.18). The wide spread is misleading; it's a gap down open followed by aggressive reversal buying from the low (37.85) to close near the high. This is a massive 'Spring' action (shakeout below 40.00 followed by strong reversal). Quarterly trend is BULLISH.

**Key Levels:** 43.87 (Resistance), 37.85 (Spring Low/Key Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 43.87 on volume, confirming continuation.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 37.85 (Failure of Spring)
---
### CORT (BEARISH (Distribution confirmed after high volume shock))
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Rejection

**Smart Money Logic:**
The market experienced a massive shock/Selling Climax bar (Dec 29, CLV -0.79, massive volume 5.58 RelVol). The last two weekly bars show the aftermath. The latest bar is a wide spread down (3.57) closing poorly (CLV -0.89) on high volume (RelVol 1.58). This negates the small prior up bar (Jan 5), confirming that the institutional distribution is ongoing following the massive move down. The price failed to find immediate support after the shock.

**Key Levels:** 38.11 (Immediate Resistance), 34.54 (Key Support/New Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 34.54 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 38.11 (Negating recent selling)
---
### COST (BULLISH (Strength confirmed after consolidation))
**VSA Status:** Effort to Rise (Demand Confirmation)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence signals confirmed early SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (Dec 29). However, the price immediately reversed course. The last weekly bar is a wide spread up (47.98) closing very strong (CLV 0.94) on high volume (RelVol 1.44). This is a strong sign of institutional demand overwhelming any previous supply and confirming the BULLISH Quarterly trend. The failure of supply dominance to cause follow-through selling is a sign of underlying strength.

**Key Levels:** 964.98 (New High/Target), 917.00 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry on continuation above 964.98, or minor pullback to 940.00.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 917.00 (Failure of demand)
---
### CPNG (BEARISH (Extreme supply confirmed))
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Effort No Result Down)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH, reinforced by the weekly SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The last weekly bar is a medium spread down (2.15) closing poorly near the low (CLV -0.618) on massive volume (RelVol 2.35). This is 'Effort No Result Down'—institutional selling is aggressive, driving the price to new lows (20.72). The volume indicates large players are continuing to liquidate.

**Key Levels:** 22.87 (Immediate Resistance), 20.72 (New Low/Key Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 20.72 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 22.40 (Negating recent selling)
---
### CRBG (BEARISH (Distribution confirmed, weak rally))
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (No Demand/Distribution)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence is confirmed STRONG SUPPLY_DOMINANCE, reinforcing the BEARISH Quarterly trend. The last weekly bar is a narrow spread up (0.93) closing slightly above midpoint (CLV 0.08) on high volume (RelVol 1.04). This high volume/narrow spread action suggests distribution (selling into the small rally). The price is struggling to gain ground despite the effort, indicating supply overwhelms demand in this distribution zone.

**Key Levels:** 30.92 (Resistance), 29.98 (Key Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 29.98 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 30.92 (Absorption of supply)
---
### CSGP (BULLISH (Major absorption of selling pressure))
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Reversal

**Smart Money Logic:**
The previous bar (Jan 5) was a severe breakdown (wide spread down, CLV -0.98, massive volume 2.05 RelVol), indicating a Selling Climax or panic. The last weekly bar is a wide spread up (8.92) closing extremely strong near the high (CLV 0.867) on even higher volume (RelVol 2.50). This VSA signature is classic high-volume absorption/reversal (Stopping Volume followed by Effort to Rise), indicating institutional buyers stepped in to soak up the selling.

**Key Levels:** 65.93 (Immediate Resistance), 57.01 (Stopping Volume Low/Key Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry on minor pullback or break above 65.93 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 57.01 (Failure of absorption)
---
### CTRA (BEARISH (Demand failure at high volume))
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax Failure / Supply Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence signals BUYING_CLIMAX (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The last weekly bar is a very wide spread up (3.80) but closes poorly (CLV -0.457) on massive volume (RelVol 2.47). This is 'Effort No Result Up'—institutional selling overwhelmed demand at the high (28.48), resulting in the price closing in the lower half of the spread. This suggests heavy distribution at the top of the range, likely trapping late buyers. Quarterly trend is BEARISH.

**Key Levels:** 28.48 (Supply High/Resistance), 24.68 (Key Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 24.68 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 28.48 (Absorption of supply)
---
### DUOL (BEARISH (Extreme supply confirmed))
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Selling Climax/Panic)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH, reinforced by the weekly SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The last weekly bar is a wide spread down (22.39) closing near the absolute low (CLV -0.78) on massive volume (RelVol 1.84). This is a clear sign of panic selling/Selling Climax, driving the price to new lows (147.70). Institutional sellers are aggressively liquidating.

**Key Levels:** 170.10 (Immediate Resistance), 147.70 (New Low/Selling Climax)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 147.70, or short entry on a failed test of 160.00.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 170.10 (Absorption of supply)
---
### ENOV (BEARISH (Extreme supply confirmed))
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Selling Climax)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH, reinforced by the weekly SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The last weekly bar is a very wide spread down (6.31) closing near the absolute low (CLV -0.87) on high volume (RelVol 1.81). This massive bar confirms institutional distribution and panic selling (Selling Climax), shattering the previous rally attempts and driving the price to new lows (23.58).

**Key Levels:** 29.74 (Resistance), 23.58 (New Low/Selling Climax)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 23.58 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 28.00 (Negating recent distribution)
---
### ENR (BEARISH (Failure of demand at resistance))
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result Down (Supply confirmed)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly context warns of confirmed early SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The previous bar (Jan 5) was a strong up bar (CLV 0.98) on average volume. The last weekly bar is a medium spread down (1.43) closing poorly (CLV -0.70) on above-average volume (RelVol 1.02). This suggests the demand (Jan 5) was immediately rejected by supply (Effort No Result Down). The failure to maintain the high close indicates sellers are active, confirming the monthly distribution signal.

**Key Levels:** 21.90 (Resistance), 20.47 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 20.47 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 21.90 (Absorption of supply)
---
### FER (BULLISH (Accumulation confirmed by high volume close))
**VSA Status:** Effort to Rise (Demand Confirmation)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence signals confirmed STRONG STOPPING_VOLUME. The last weekly bar is a medium spread up (1.93) closing very strong (CLV 0.658) on high volume (RelVol 1.19). This confirms that institutional buyers have taken control after the high-volume shakeout (Dec 15 and Dec 29). The sustained push higher and strong close indicate successful accumulation, despite the monthly SUPPLY_DOMINANCE warning.

**Key Levels:** 68.54 (Resistance/High), 66.61 (Immediate Support/Last Open)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 68.54 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 66.61 (Failure of demand)
---
### FFIN (BULLISH (Strength overcoming supply))
**VSA Status:** Effort to Rise (Demand Confirmation)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence signals SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (WATCH_FOR_TEST). However, the last two weekly bars show strong demand. The last weekly bar is a medium spread up (1.82) closing strongly (CLV 0.527) on high volume (RelVol 1.28). This confirms a push higher following the previous week's wide spread up/high CLV bar (Jan 5). The strength indicates that any selling pressure is being absorbed by institutional demand, confirming the Quarterly BULLISH_TREND.

**Key Levels:** 32.97 (Resistance/High), 31.15 (Key Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 32.97 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 31.15 (Failure of demand)
---
### FISV (BEARISH (Significant supply confirmed))
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Effort No Result Down)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the weekly SUPPLY_DOMINANCE is active. The last weekly bar is a medium spread down (3.56) closing poorly (CLV -0.82) on massive volume (RelVol 1.58). This is a strong sign of institutional distribution or profit-taking, confirming the failure of the demand seen on the previous bar (Jan 5, CLV 0.81). The price is moving decisively down toward the low of the consolidation range.

**Key Levels:** 69.53 (Resistance), 65.97 (Key Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 65.97 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 69.44 (Negating recent distribution)
---
### GBCI (BULLISH (Strength confirmed))
**VSA Status:** Effort to Rise (Demand Confirmation)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Despite the monthly confirmed early SUPPLY_DOMINANCE, the weekly chart shows strong demand. The last weekly bar is a medium spread up (2.95) closing strong (CLV 0.301) on high volume (RelVol 1.22). This follows a strong up bar (Jan 5, CLV 0.49). Consistent demand is overcoming the selling pressure indicated by the monthly context, likely absorbing the supply and pushing into higher price targets. Quarterly trend is BULLISH.

**Key Levels:** 48.89 (Resistance/High), 45.94 (Key Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 48.89 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 45.94 (Failure of demand)
---
### GEN (BEARISH (Weak close despite low volume))
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result Down (Supply confirmed)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence signals confirmed early STOPPING_VOLUME (Jan 5: wide spread up, CLV 0.77). However, the last weekly bar is a narrow spread down (1.00) closing very poorly (CLV -0.799) on normal volume (RelVol 1.13). The failure to maintain the open price and the poor close, despite the overall tight range, suggests supply is dominant. The high volume prior rally was rejected. Quarterly trend is BEARISH.

**Key Levels:** 27.00 (Resistance), 26.00 (Key Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 26.00 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 27.00 (Absorption of supply)
---
### GRMN (BEARISH (Weakness Confirmed))
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
GRMN confirmed 'Supply Dominance' on the weekly chart. The weekly bar (Jan 12) had high volume (RelVol 0.98, near average but high historically) on a moderate spread, closing slightly positive (CLV 0.03). Critically, this bar followed a massive bullish move (Jan 5: wide spread, high volume, CLV 0.67), suggesting the buying push is stalling at high prices (214.46). The current weekly bar shows an inability to hold gains, suggesting renewed selling pressure is absorbing demand, confirmed by the weekly signal.

**Key Levels:** 214.46 (Confirmed Supply/Recent High), 208.98 (Immediate Support), 201.47 (Support Zone)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry short on a break and close below 211.24 (Jan 12 Open) or a failure to make a new high on the next daily bar.
- **Invalidation:** Entry invalidation if price closes above 214.46.
---
### GWRE (BEARISH (Extreme Weakness))
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Down-thrust (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stock is in a bearish quarterly trend. The last two weeks show massive bearish volume (RelVol 1.58 and 2.35) with wide spreads closing at the extreme lows (CLV near -1.0). The last weekly candle (Jan 12) is a down-thrust/sign of extreme weakness (SOW) on huge volume (10.7M). This confirms strong distribution and panic selling. Smart money is aggressively liquidating positions.

**Key Levels:** 187.63 (Previous Low Resistance), 158.80 (New Swing Low), 200.72 (Major overhead supply)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry short on a low-volume rally/test back toward 170-175, or on a confirmed break below the 158.80 low.
- **Invalidation:** Entry invalidation if price closes above 187.63 (previous weekly close resistance).
---
### HDB (BEARISH (Significant Weakness))
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Down-thrust (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stock is in a bearish quarterly trend and registered a major bearish signal on Jan 5 (high volume, wide spread, CLV -0.91). This was a clear Sign of Weakness (SOW) or high-volume down-thrust. The following week (Jan 12) confirmed the weakness with high volume (RelVol 1.51) and a wide spread closing near the low (CLV -0.45). This indicates strong smart money selling pressure overwhelming any demand.

**Key Levels:** 36.48 (Overhead Supply), 32.29 (Recent Swing Low), 33.09 (Intermediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry short on a failed rally back towards 34.00, or a break and close below 32.29.
- **Invalidation:** Entry invalidation if price closes above the Jan 5 open of 35.75.
---
### HPE (BEARISH (Selling Pressure Dominates))
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Monthly) / Sign of Weakness (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly chart had an initial Stopping Volume signal in December, but the follow-through in January has been extremely bearish. The last weekly bar (Jan 12) shows a wide spread on high volume (RelVol 0.61, but high for the downtrend), closing at the absolute low (CLV -0.97). This is a strong SOW, negating the prior monthly accumulation idea. Distribution is active. The monthly CLV is also extremely low (-0.98), confirming major weakness.

**Key Levels:** 24.41 (Overhead Supply), 21.42 (Recent Low/Support Test), 22.17 (Failed Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry short on a break below 21.42 or a low-volume rally failing near 22.00.
- **Invalidation:** Entry invalidation if price closes above 22.71.
---
### HRMY (BEARISH (Confirmed Distribution))
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Monthly) / Sign of Weakness (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly context is 'Supply Dominance' (Watching for Test). The weekly bar (Jan 12) shows high volume (RelVol 1.18) on a wide spread, closing near the low (CLV -0.35). This is a clear Sign of Weakness (SOW) after the stock failed to follow through on the prior week's bullish momentum (Jan 5 CLV 0.88). The immediate rejection confirms active distribution at high prices (near 39.40).

**Key Levels:** 39.40 (Confirmed Supply/Weekly High), 36.41 (Immediate Support), 34.68 (Swing Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry short on a break below the 36.00 zone, or a failed rally back towards 37.50.
- **Invalidation:** Entry invalidation if price closes above 39.40.
---
### IREN (BULLISH (Aggressive Mark-Up))
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Monthly) / Sign of Strength (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Despite the monthly 'Supply Dominance' warning (which appeared to be absorbed over December), the weekly chart shows extreme strength. The Jan 12 bar has huge volume (RelVol 1.46) on a massive spread (12.90), closing near the high (CLV 0.85). This is an unmistakable Sign of Strength (SOS) or aggressive mark-up, likely fueled by short covering and new buying. The high volume confirms the move is backed by smart money.

**Key Levels:** 58.75 (New High/Target), 46.72 (Immediate Support/Springboard), 42.70 (Strong Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry long on a minor pullback (Test) toward 55.00, or a continuation above 58.75.
- **Invalidation:** Entry invalidation if price closes below 45.85.
---
### JPM (BEARISH (Confirmed Distribution))
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Down-thrust (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stock is in a bullish quarterly trend but showed extreme weakness on the weekly chart, triggering a 'Supply Dominance' watch. The last weekly bar (Jan 12) had extremely high volume (RelVol 2.23) and a wide spread, closing near the low (CLV -0.38). This is a heavy liquidation/down-thrust, indicating aggressive distribution by smart money into the weakness. The failure to hold 320 is critical.

**Key Levels:** 326.86 (Immediate Overhead Supply), 306.12 (Swing Low), 312.47 (Recent Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry short on a weak rally/Test of Supply back toward 318.00, or a break and close below 306.12.
- **Invalidation:** Entry invalidation if price closes above the Jan 5 high of 335.73.
---
### KVYO (BEARISH (Extreme Weakness Confirmed))
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Weekly) / Down-thrust (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
KVYO is in a bearish quarterly trend. The monthly signal was 'Stopping Volume', but the recent weekly action contradicts accumulation. The Jan 12 weekly bar is a massive down-thrust, showing high volume (RelVol 1.31) on a wide spread, closing at the extreme low (CLV -0.96). This is a powerful Sign of Weakness (SOW), overriding the earlier potential accumulation signal. Smart money is liquidating.

**Key Levels:** 28.58 (Immediate Resistance), 23.74 (New Swing Low), 32.47 (Overhead Supply)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry short on a weak rally back toward 25.00-26.00, or a break below 23.74.
- **Invalidation:** Entry invalidation if price closes above the Jan 5 open of 28.99.
---
### KYMR (BEARISH (Confirmed Distribution))
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Monthly) / Sign of Weakness (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stock is in a bullish quarterly trend but monthly context warns of a Buying Climax. The last two weekly bars show clear signs of weakness. The Jan 12 bar has high volume (RelVol 0.84) on a wide spread, closing at the absolute low (CLV -0.96). This is a strong Sign of Weakness/down-thrust, confirming that the monthly Buying Climax has resulted in active distribution.

**Key Levels:** 76.71 (Immediate Overhead Supply), 69.41 (New Swing Low), 83.99 (Distribution Top)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry short on a low-volume rally back toward 72.00, or a break and close below 69.41.
- **Invalidation:** Entry invalidation if price closes above 77.92.
---
### MAN (BEARISH (Weakness Emerging))
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Monthly) / Effort No Result (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly chart confirmed 'Supply Dominance' (CLV -0.33). The latest weekly bar (Jan 12) shows high volume (RelVol 1.00) on a wide spread, closing in the lower half (CLV -0.39). This is 'Effort No Result' on the upside, as the attempted rally to 31.61 failed aggressively. The high volume confirms supply entering the market. This reinforces the bearish monthly context.

**Key Levels:** 31.61 (Supply/Weekly High), 29.40 (Immediate Support), 31.16 (Previous Open)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry short on a break and close below 30.00, targeting 29.40.
- **Invalidation:** Entry invalidation if price closes above 31.61.
---
### MNDY (BEARISH (Extreme Weakness Confirmed))
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Down-thrust (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stock is in a bearish quarterly trend, and the weekly bar (Jan 12) delivered a major Sign of Weakness (SOW). Volume was high (RelVol 1.91) on a massive spread, closing at the extreme low (CLV -0.97). This is a severe down-thrust, indicating aggressive panic selling and liquidation by smart money, overpowering the prior week's tentative strength (Jan 5 CLV 0.33).

**Key Levels:** 148.03 (Overhead Supply), 126.41 (New Swing Low), 142.09 (Intermediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry short on a weak rally/Test of Supply back towards 130.00-135.00, or a break below 126.41.
- **Invalidation:** Entry invalidation if price closes above 147.39.
---
### MOD (BULLISH (Confirmed Accumulation/Spring))
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Weekly) / Test of Demand (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stock is in a bearish quarterly trend, making the bullish signal noteworthy. The Jan 5 bar was climatic selling (CLV -0.20, high volume), marking potential Stopping Volume. The Jan 12 weekly bar shows high volume (RelVol 1.19) on a wide spread, closing near the high (CLV 0.70). This is a strong rebound and potential Sign of Strength (SOS) or successful 'spring' action, suggesting smart money accumulation.

**Key Levels:** 139.39 (Immediate Resistance), 122.21 (Spring Low/Support), 146.26 (Overhead Supply)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry long on a successful low-volume Test of Demand near 130.00, or a break and hold above 140.00.
- **Invalidation:** Entry invalidation if price closes below 122.21.

### MSFU (BEARISH (Confirmed Weakness))
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Weekly) / Down-thrust (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stock is in a bearish quarterly trend and monthly context warns of 'Supply Dominance.' The Jan 12 weekly bar shows high volume (RelVol 1.99) on a wide spread, closing at the low (CLV -0.72). This is a strong Sign of Weakness/Down-thrust. Despite prior tests (Dec 22, Jan 5) attempting to hold, the market has clearly broken down, indicating heavy smart money liquidation.

**Key Levels:** 40.85 (Immediate Overhead Supply), 36.67 (New Swing Low), 42.38 (Major Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry short on a weak rally/Test of Supply back toward 38.00-39.00, or a break below 36.67.
- **Invalidation:** Entry invalidation if price closes above 40.85.
---
### NFXL (BEARISH (Extreme Weakness Confirmed))
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Down-thrust (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stock is in a bearish quarterly trend. The weekly chart confirms 'Supply Dominance' with the last bar (Jan 12) showing high volume (RelVol 2.15) on a wide spread, closing at the extreme low (CLV -0.88). This is an aggressive down-thrust, confirming strong distribution and liquidation. The market is failing to absorb supply even at lower levels.

**Key Levels:** 29.08 (Immediate Overhead Supply), 26.69 (New Swing Low), 30.53 (Prior Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry short on a weak rally/Test of Supply back toward 28.00, or a break and close below 26.69.
- **Invalidation:** Entry invalidation if price closes above 28.84 (previous weekly close resistance).
---
### OC (BULLISH (Confirmed Accumulation/Mark-Up))
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Monthly) / Sign of Strength (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly chart signaled Stopping Volume in December. The weekly bar (Jan 12) shows high volume (RelVol 1.07) on a moderate spread, closing in the upper half (CLV 0.46). This follows a very strong bar (Jan 5: CLV 0.96) which broke through prior resistance. The current action is consolidating the gains at higher levels, confirming the continuation of the mark-up phase initiated by accumulation, despite the slight closing weakness compared to the high.

**Key Levels:** 126.08 (New High/Target), 120.39 (Immediate Support), 111.14 (Major Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry long on a low-volume Test of Demand near 122.00, or a break and hold above 126.08.
- **Invalidation:** Entry invalidation if price closes below 120.39.
---
### OKLO (NEUTRAL/BEARISH (Distribution Active))
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Monthly) / Effort No Result (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly chart confirmed a Buying Climax in December (CLV -0.95), suggesting heavy distribution after a parabolic move. The Jan 12 weekly bar saw high volume (RelVol 0.93) on a wide spread, closing in the lower half (CLV -0.38). This is 'Effort No Result' on the upside, confirming that supply is overwhelming demand in the high 90s. The rally from the Jan 5 low is failing to sustain momentum, confirming the distribution scenario.

**Key Levels:** 107.60 (Immediate Overhead Supply), 89.30 (Immediate Support), 76.92 (Major Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry short on a failure to break above 98.00, or a decisive break and close below 89.30.
- **Invalidation:** Entry invalidation if price closes above 107.60.
---
### PAYX (BEARISH (Confirmed Weakness))
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly chart confirmed 'Supply Dominance.' The Jan 12 weekly bar saw high volume (RelVol 1.04) on a wide spread, closing near the low (CLV -0.10). This indicates that the rally attempt from the prior week (Jan 5 CLV 0.64) failed under renewed selling pressure. This 'Effort No Result' on the upside confirms active distribution near 114.00, validating the bearish weekly signal.

**Key Levels:** 113.99 (Immediate Overhead Supply), 108.91 (Immediate Support), 115.07 (Major Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry short on a failed rally back towards 112.50, or a decisive break and close below 108.91.
- **Invalidation:** Entry invalidation if price closes above 113.99.
---
### PDD (BEARISH (Extreme Weakness Confirmed))
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Down-thrust (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stock is in a bearish quarterly trend. The weekly chart confirms 'Supply Dominance' (Watch for Test). The Jan 12 bar shows extremely high volume (RelVol 2.02) on a massive spread, closing at the low (CLV -0.81). This is a strong Sign of Weakness/Down-thrust. Smart money is aggressively liquidating, overriding the attempted rally from the previous weeks. This confirmed breakdown suggests lower prices ahead.

**Key Levels:** 121.99 (Immediate Overhead Supply), 105.10 (New Swing Low), 117.45 (Previous Open Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry short on a weak rally/Test of Supply back toward 110.00, or a break and close below 105.10.
- **Invalidation:** Entry invalidation if price closes above 121.99.
---
### PGY (BEARISH (Confirmed Weakness))
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Monthly) / Sign of Weakness (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stock is in a bearish quarterly trend, and the monthly chart confirmed 'Supply Dominance.' The Jan 12 weekly bar shows high volume (RelVol 1.07) on a wide spread, closing at the extreme low (CLV -0.93). This is a strong Sign of Weakness/down-thrust. The previous week's attempt to rally (Jan 5 CLV 0.64) failed completely, indicating that selling pressure remains dominant and smart money is heavily distributing.

**Key Levels:** 25.43 (Immediate Overhead Supply), 21.87 (New Swing Low), 22.66 (Previous Open Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry short on a weak rally/Test of Supply back toward 23.00, or a break and close below 21.87.
- **Invalidation:** Entry invalidation if price closes above 25.43.
---
### PSN (BULLISH (Accumulation/Mark-Up))
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Monthly) / Effort to Rise (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly chart warns of Supply Dominance. However, the last two weekly bars show massive strength, especially the Jan 5 bar (CLV 0.97, high volume). The Jan 12 bar shows sustained high volume (RelVol 0.84) on a moderate spread, closing near the high (CLV 0.83). This signals sustained demand and a solid Sign of Strength (SOS), actively absorbing the overhead supply identified on the monthly chart. This is a clear Change of Character (CoC).

**Key Levels:** 72.81 (New High/Target), 68.85 (Immediate Support), 61.56 (Major Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry long on a minor pullback (Test) toward 70.00, or a continuation above 72.81.
- **Invalidation:** Entry invalidation if price closes below 68.85.
---
### QTWO (BEARISH (Confirmed Weakness))
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Monthly) / Down-thrust (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stock is in a bearish quarterly trend, and the monthly confirmed 'Supply Dominance.' The Jan 12 weekly bar shows high volume (RelVol 0.57, which is high for the low-volume consolidation) on a wide spread, closing at the extreme low (CLV -0.927). This is a sharp down-thrust, confirming strong selling and a breakdown from the 68-74 consolidation zone, validating the bearish monthly signal.

**Key Levels:** 69.43 (Previous Support/New Resistance), 64.87 (New Swing Low), 72.49 (Overhead Supply)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry short on a weak rally/Test of Supply back toward 67.00, or a break and close below 64.87.
- **Invalidation:** Entry invalidation if price closes above 70.24.
---
### RARE (BEARISH (Continued Weakness))
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Weekly) / Effort No Result (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stock is in a bearish quarterly trend. Although the Dec 29 bar showed climatic volume (RelVol 4.56) closing high (CLV 0.85), suggesting a potential spring, the follow-through failed immediately. The last two bars (Jan 5 and Jan 12) show heavy volume (RelVols 1.88 and 1.62) with spreads closing near the low (CLV -0.70 and -0.92). This confirms renewed supply dominance and negates the prior spring attempt. Smart money continues to sell.

**Key Levels:** 24.65 (Immediate Overhead Supply), 22.40 (Immediate Support), 25.09 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry short on a failure to hold 22.40, or a weak rally/Test of Supply back toward 23.50.
- **Invalidation:** Entry invalidation if price closes above 24.65.
---
### RGLD (BULLISH (Confirmed Mark-Up))
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Monthly) / Sign of Strength (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly chart warns of Supply Dominance, but the weekly chart shows extreme strength. The Jan 12 bar has high volume (RelVol 1.05) on a wide spread, closing near the high (CLV 0.96). This is a strong Sign of Strength (SOS) or aggressive mark-up, breaking out of a trading range (220-248). The market is displaying institutional buying and absorption of any previous supply.

**Key Levels:** 265.48 (New High/Target), 246.96 (Immediate Support), 235.02 (Previous Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry long on a low-volume Test of Demand near 255.00, or a continuation above 265.48.
- **Invalidation:** Entry invalidation if price closes below 246.96.
---
### RLI (BEARISH (Distribution Confirmed))
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Weekly/Monthly) / Down-thrust (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The market shows Buying Climax warnings on both weekly and monthly charts. The last weekly bar (Jan 12) saw high volume (RelVol 1.12) on a moderate spread, closing at the absolute low (CLV -0.008, essentially closing on the low). This is a strong Sign of Weakness/Down-thrust, confirming that the smart money has successfully distributed its position, leading to price failure and liquidation. The failure to hold 60.00 is bearish.

**Key Levels:** 63.19 (Immediate Overhead Supply), 58.20 (New Swing Low), 65.64 (Distribution Top)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry short on a weak rally/Test of Supply back toward 60.50, or a break and close below 58.20.
- **Invalidation:** Entry invalidation if price closes above 60.52.
---
### SPOT (BEARISH (Extreme Weakness Confirmed))
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Down-thrust (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stock is in a bearish quarterly trend. The last two weekly bars show devastating weakness. The Jan 12 bar had extremely high volume (RelVol 2.30) on a wide spread, closing at the extreme low (CLV -0.84). This is an aggressive down-thrust (SOW), confirming panic selling and distribution, following the breakdown signaled on Jan 5. The failed rally confirms smart money liquidation is overwhelming demand.

**Key Levels:** 548.55 (Immediate Overhead Supply), 500.82 (New Swing Low), 575.00 (Major Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry short on a weak rally/Test of Supply back toward 520.00, or a break and close below 500.82.
- **Invalidation:** Entry invalidation if price closes above 548.55.
---
### TFX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Confirmed Weakness)

**Smart Money Logic:**
TFX is in a persistent BEARISH_TREND. The last weekly bar was a wide spread down bar (Spread 10.22) on high volume (RelVol 1.81), closing almost exactly on the low (CLV -0.93). This confirms aggressive supply pushing the price lower, breaking below key support levels established in the prior weeks. The monthly bar (CLV -0.97) also indicates extreme weakness, suggesting the bearish trend is accelerating.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 112.80 (Recent support turned resistance), Next Major Support: 100.00 (Psychological level), Supply Zone: 113.00 - 118.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Minor rally/Test into 106.00 or a break below 102.50.
- **Invalidation:** 113.00 (Above last week's open/previous close)
---
### VONG (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
VONG is in a quarterly BEARISH_TREND. The last weekly bar was a wide spread down bar (Spread 3.15) closing near the low (CLV -0.32), on extremely high volume (RelVol 2.81). This is extreme selling pressure. Although the prior monthly bar showed Stopping Volume, the immediate weekly response is overwhelming supply dominance, pushing the price back towards the lows of the consolidation area (120.00).

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 123.18 (Previous high), Support: 120.03 (Critical low), Supply Zone: 121.50 - 122.50

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 120.00 on volume, or a failed rally (No Demand) near 122.00.
- **Invalidation:** 123.20 (Above last week's high)
---
### WFC (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
WFC is in a quarterly BULLISH_TREND, but the last weekly bar showed extreme Supply Dominance. It was a very wide spread down bar (Spread 7.69) on overwhelming volume (RelVol 1.96), closing almost on the low (CLV -0.91). This is a strong signal of institutional distribution and a probable change of character, initiating a strong correction despite the long-term bullish context. The price broke down below previous significant consolidation support near 93.00.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 93.65 (Breakdown level/supply), Support: 88.06 (Last week's low), Next Target Support: 85.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Failed Test/No Demand rally toward 91.00-92.00.
- **Invalidation:** 94.83 (Above last week's open)
---
### WGMI (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Monthly Watch)

**Smart Money Logic:**
WGMI is in a quarterly BULLISH_TREND. The monthly chart indicates a potential Buying Climax watch, but the last weekly bar was a very wide spread up bar (Spread 7.44) on moderate volume (RelVol 1.07), closing near the high (CLV 0.80). This shows strong upward momentum, overcoming the supply shown in the prior week. The monthly volume (RelVol 0.69) is lower than December, reducing the immediate bearish threat from the monthly climax signal. Weekly price strength is dominant.

**Key Levels:** Support: 44.34 (Previous accumulation low), Resistance/Target: 51.78 (Current high), Potential Test Zone: 48.00 - 49.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Successful Test (No Supply) on low volume below 50.00, or continued break above 51.80.
- **Invalidation:** 44.30 (Below last week's low)
---
### WMG (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Confirmed Strong)

**Smart Money Logic:**
WMG is in a quarterly BULLISH_TREND, but the weekly chart shows confirmed strong Buying Climax. The last weekly bar was a down bar, on high volume (RelVol 1.02), closing near the low (CLV -0.64). This immediately confirms the supply that entered during the previous climactic high of 31.62. Smart Money is taking profits, and we expect a reaction back into the range. The low monthly volume (RelVol 0.56) suggests retail buyers were trapped at the peak.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 31.62 (Climax High/Supply), Support: 30.37 (Immediate support), Target Support: 29.30

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 30.37, or a high volume upthrust/Test toward 31.00.
- **Invalidation:** 31.63 (Above the Climax high)
---
### ZBH (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
ZBH is in a quarterly BEARISH_TREND. The last weekly bar was a wide spread down bar (Spread 7.86) on high volume (RelVol 1.95), closing well off the low (CLV -0.60). This is strong Supply Dominance, breaking recent support. Although the CLV is not extremely low, the penetration below 89.00 on this volume suggests supply is back in control, confirming the bearish quarterly trend. The monthly bar also confirms major weakness (CLV -0.67).

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 92.80 (Previous support turned resistance), Support: 85.76 (Last week's low), Target Low: 85.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Failed rally/Test (No Demand) into 90.00-91.00.
- **Invalidation:** 93.62 (Above last week's high)
---
## 👀 Watch/Monitoring
### BHF (BEARISH (Short-term weakness, potential for reversal test))
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax/Effort to Fall (Absorption)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar shows a wide spread down (0.89) closing poorly near the low, suggesting strong supply (Effort to Fall). However, the monthly context indicates a previous Buying Climax (Nov 2025) and subsequent down month (Dec 2025). The most recent monthly bar (Jan 2026) is a wide spread down (1.56) closing near the low with normal volume (RelVol 0.68), suggesting further weakness following the earlier Buying Climax confirmation (Dec 2025). The last weekly bar closed near the low with slightly elevated volume (RelVol 0.74), confirming short-term selling pressure. Given the Quarterly BEARISH_TREND, the prior monthly Buying Climax suggests a struggle, but the recent action confirms sellers are in control below the climax level.

**Key Levels:** 65.50 (Prior High/Resistance), 64.04 (Current Support/Last Close), 63.80 (Recent Low Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 63.79 on increased volume, targeting Quarterly trend continuation.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 65.50 (Resistance break)
---
### BKKT (BULLISH (Confirmed breakout))
**VSA Status:** Effort to Rise (Strong Demand)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Despite a monthly SUPPLY_DOMINANCE warning, the last two weekly bars show immense strength. The second to last week was a very wide spread up (5.16) closing high (CLV 0.66) on high volume (RelVol 1.04). The most recent weekly bar built on this, with an even wider spread up (6.61) closing near the high (CLV 0.788) on elevated volume (RelVol 1.21). This constitutes massive institutional Demand stepping in, overcoming the monthly supply context and confirming the Quarterly BULLISH_TREND.

**Key Levels:** 22.11 (Recent High/Target), 16.38 (Immediate Support/Previous Open), 15.50 (Key breakout Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Consolidation above 21.00 followed by a high volume break or entry on minor pullback to 20.00.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 15.50 (Breaking critical prior low)
---
### BKSY (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS BULLISH (Testing Highs, but high volume near top requires caution))
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Distribution

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly context shows a confirmed early BUYING_CLIMAX. The last weekly bar is a wide spread up (5.55) on high volume (RelVol 1.07), but the CLV is only 0.18, meaning the price closed far off the high (29.79), indicating aggressive institutional selling/profit-taking (Selling into Strength). Price made a new high (29.79), confirming the climax stage. We need to watch for follow-through selling.

**Key Levels:** 29.79 (Selling Climax High/Resistance), 25.45 (Immediate Support/Last Open), 24.24 (Strong Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 25.45 on high volume (Short entry) OR successful test of 25.45 (Long entry).
- **Invalidation:** Close above 29.79 (Absorption of supply)
---
### BKV (BULLISH (Sign of accumulation after stopping volume))
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Up-thrust Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The previous weekly bar (Jan 5) was a wide spread down (3.17) closing poorly (CLV -0.58) on high volume (RelVol 1.02), potentially initiating a shakeout. However, the last weekly bar is a narrow-medium spread up (1.77) closing strongly near the high (CLV 0.49), also on high volume (RelVol 1.15). This suggests Stopping Volume and subsequent professional buying/accumulation near the low (24.93). The quarterly trend is BULLISH, supporting accumulation.

**Key Levels:** 26.70 (Immediate Resistance), 24.93 (Stopping Volume Low/Key Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 26.70 on strong volume, targeting the Quarterly high.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 24.93 (Failure of accumulation)
---
### BL (BEARISH (Extreme weakness, potential for snap-back))
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Selling Climax)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH, reinforced by the weekly SUPPLY_DOMINANCE sequence. The last weekly bar is a very wide spread down (7.39) closing near the low (CLV -0.51) on extremely high volume (RelVol 2.04). This level of volume and spread suggests a Selling Climax or panic selling. While structurally bearish, the extreme climax volume may indicate an imminent reaction rally or short-term exhaustion of sellers. For VSA, this is a strong sign of institutional distribution/panic.

**Key Levels:** 58.25 (Previous High Resistance), 50.85 (Selling Climax Low/Key Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a sign of absorption/test of the 50.85 low (Long counter-trend entry) OR break below 50.85 (Short continuation).
- **Invalidation:** Close above 56.70 (Absorbing recent supply)
---
### BND (NEUTRAL/BEARISH (High volume rejection at the top of a tight range))
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Distribution

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly bar is a medium spread down (0.31) closing poorly (CLV -0.74) on extremely high volume (RelVol 1.88). Given the tight range of BND (a bond ETF), this volume spike and poor close is a significant sign of institutional distribution or profit-taking at the upper end of its recent range. The Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but this level of supply warrants caution and confirms the weekly SUPPLY_DOMINANCE status.

**Key Levels:** 74.47 (Recent High Resistance), 74.16 (Immediate Support), 73.77 (Strong Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 74.16 on high volume (Short entry).
- **Invalidation:** Close above 74.47 (Absorption of supply)
---
### BP (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS BEARISH (Supply absorption followed by high volume rejection))
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Shakeout

**Smart Money Logic:**
The market is in a BEARISH Quarterly trend. The previous bar (Jan 5) was a wide spread down (2.83) on huge volume (RelVol 1.85), testing previous support. The latest bar is a wide spread up (2.23) closing mid-range (CLV 0.18) on high volume (RelVol 1.51). This high volume with a mediocre close suggests significant supply met the upward movement around 36.29. This is potentially a strong Up-thrust or a final rejection of demand after the shakeout.

**Key Levels:** 36.29 (Resistance/High Volume Supply), 34.06 (Immediate Support), 33.40 (Critical Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on break below 34.06 on volume. Long entry on high volume break and close above 36.29.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 36.29 (Clearing supply)
---
### BXSL (BULLISH (Potential pivot after monthly distribution))
**VSA Status:** No Supply / Absorption

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly context shows a confirmed SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. However, the last weekly bar is a medium spread up (1.09) closing very strong near the high (CLV 0.74) on good volume (RelVol 1.01). This suggests strong absorption (Demand) following the wide spread down/Selling Climax seen on Jan 5. This demand response is attempting to negate the previous supply action and establish a trading range or reverse the short-term downward trend.

**Key Levels:** 27.06 (Resistance), 25.56 (Accumulation Low/Key Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close above 26.85 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 25.56 (Failure of absorption)
---
### CADE (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS BEARISH (Demand drying up after climax))
**VSA Status:** No Demand / Failed Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly context indicates a BUYING_CLIMAX. The latest weekly bar is a medium spread up (2.09) closing strong (CLV 0.64) on high volume (RelVol 1.29). However, the bar failed to maintain the high (44.86) and the overall reaction to the large up bar on Jan 5 (CLV 0.43) is slow. The last bar attempted to test the high-volume move, but the strong close near the high suggests temporary demand is present. Given the underlying monthly climax, the rally is suspicious. A key level test is anticipated.

**Key Levels:** 44.87 (Resistance), 42.78 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry if the 44.87 level fails to break on volume, followed by a break below 43.50.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 44.87 on heavy volume (Strength)
---
### CBRL (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS BEARISH (High volume failed follow-through))
**VSA Status:** Effort to Rise (Potential Up-thrust)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is a wide spread up (7.30) closing midrange/high (CLV 0.346) on massive volume (RelVol 1.68). While the prior week was strong demand, this high volume, wide spread bar failed to close strongly at the high (36.89), suggesting institutional selling pressure (Up-thrust). The price is now trading significantly above the recent accumulation area (26.00). Given the monthly SUPPLY_DOMINANCE warning, this could be a large distribution move.

**Key Levels:** 36.89 (High/Potential Up-thrust), 30.00 (Immediate Support/Last Open), 29.59 (Strong Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on break below 32.00 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 36.89 (Confirmed Demand)
---
### CCOI (BULLISH (Strength overcoming supply))
**VSA Status:** Effort to Rise (Demand Confirmation)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Despite the monthly confirmed early BUYING_CLIMAX, the price has reversed positively. The last weekly bar is a medium spread up (1.97) closing strong (CLV 0.614) on slightly below average volume (RelVol 0.69). This confirms demand absorption from the previous week's wide spread up bar (Jan 5, CLV 0.849, RelVol 0.68). Price successfully tested the 19.38 low and is now establishing a higher floor, suggesting that earlier climax was absorbed, or the current move is a reaction rally within distribution.

**Key Levels:** 24.23 (Resistance), 22.26 (Immediate Support), 19.38 (Key Accumulation Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 24.23 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 22.26 (Failure of demand)
---
### CELC (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS BEARISH (High volume failed follow-through))
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result Up (Supply at Highs)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the monthly context warns of confirmed SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (Early). The last weekly bar is a very wide spread (16.06) but closes poorly (CLV -0.18) on average volume (RelVol 0.65). This is 'Effort No Result Up'—despite making a new high (116.44), the price was aggressively sold off back toward the low of the bar. This suggests institutional supply is heavy at these elevated levels, confirming the underlying monthly distribution warning.

**Key Levels:** 116.44 (Supply High/Resistance), 104.00 (Immediate Support/Last Open), 100.38 (Key Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on break below 104.00 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 116.44 (Overcoming supply)
---
### DOW (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS BEARISH (High volume rejection at new high))
**VSA Status:** Effort to Rise (Up-thrust)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly trend signals confirmed early SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The last weekly bar is a wide spread up (2.45) closing midpoint (CLV 0.22) on high volume (RelVol 1.21). This bar hit a new high (28.52) but failed to close strongly, indicating institutional selling pressure (Up-thrust/Distribution). This behavior aligns with the monthly supply warning, suggesting the strong rally from 24.18 (Jan 5) is being met with resistance from smart money.

**Key Levels:** 28.52 (Up-thrust High/Resistance), 26.07 (Key Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on break below 26.07 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 28.52 (Absorption of supply)
---
### FFIV (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS BEARISH (High volume distribution at highs))
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Effort No Result Up)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly trend signals STOPPING_VOLUME, potentially marking the end of the previous distribution/consolidation phase. The last weekly bar is a wide spread up (16.17) but closes poorly (CLV -0.549) on high volume (RelVol 1.70). This is 'Effort No Result Up'—the high volume suggests significant supply met the buying near the high (280.75), pushing the close down. This indicates institutional distribution/profit-taking at the upper end of the range.

**Key Levels:** 280.75 (Supply High/Resistance), 264.58 (Key Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on break below 264.58 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 280.75 (Absorption of supply)
---
### FIBK (NEUTRAL (Slowdown in momentum after climax warning))
**VSA Status:** No Demand (Failure to follow through)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly context warns of a confirmed early BUYING_CLIMAX. The last weekly bar is a medium spread up (1.59) closing mid-range (CLV 0.106) on high volume (RelVol 1.27). Despite high volume, the price failed to close strong and follow through on the massive up move from the previous week (Jan 5, CLV 0.45). This slow, mediocre progress with high volume indicates that institutional demand is drying up and supply is entering the market near 37.56.

**Key Levels:** 37.56 (Resistance), 35.97 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on break below 36.85 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 37.56 on strong volume.
---
### FLEX (BULLISH (Strength confirmed after shakeout))
**VSA Status:** Effort to Rise (Demand Confirmation)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence signals confirmed early SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (Dec 15). The last bar is a wide spread up (6.34) closing mid-range (CLV 0.29) on high volume (RelVol 0.85). This follows the shakeout/test of the low on Jan 5 (CLV -0.19). The wide spread on the last bar, closing in the upper range, suggests institutional absorption of supply and movement higher, overriding the temporary supply dominance warning. Quarterly trend is BULLISH.

**Key Levels:** 67.08 (Resistance), 64.83 (Immediate Support), 60.74 (Key Accumulation Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 67.08 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 60.74 (Failure of demand)
---
### FNF (BULLISH (Accumulation after high volume selling))
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Absorption)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence signals STOPPING_VOLUME (WATCH_FOR_TEST) following a BEARISH Quarterly trend. The last weekly bar is a wide spread down (3.75) closing near the high (CLV 0.093) on high volume (RelVol 1.81). A wide spread down bar closing near the high on high volume is classic Stopping Volume/Accumulation, where institutional buying absorbs the selling pressure near the low (50.82).

**Key Levels:** 54.57 (Resistance), 50.82 (Stopping Volume Low/Key Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 54.57 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 50.82 (Failure of accumulation)
---
### FRPT (NEUTRAL (Weak continuation after stopping volume))
**VSA Status:** No Demand (Failure to follow through)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly context signals confirmed early STOPPING_VOLUME. The last weekly bar is a medium spread up (4.42) closing mid-range (CLV 0.48) on average volume (RelVol 0.76). This follow-through is weak compared to the preceding strong demand bar (Jan 5, CLV 0.96). The mid-range close suggests supply is meeting the price advance. While the setup is Bullish (Quarterly BULLISH), the weak effort to rise indicates caution.

**Key Levels:** 65.40 (Resistance), 64.06 (Immediate Support), 60.97 (Accumulation Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 65.40 on high volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 60.97 (Failure of accumulation)
---
### GKOS (NEUTRAL (Watching for Distribution))
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / End of Rising Market (Monthly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly chart shows a strong upward push leading into December and January, marked by wide spreads (27.67 in Jan) and high volume (7.5M+ weekly volume). However, the previous monthly candle was a Buying Climax signal (CLV 0.25). The most recent weekly bar (Jan 12) has a massive spread and high volume (RelVol 1.53), closing near the high (CLV 0.89), suggesting strong accumulation/effort. Given the Monthly Buying Climax context, this extreme effort needs confirmation. If this price level fails a subsequent test, distribution is confirmed.

**Key Levels:** 121.63 (Recent High/Potential Climax Top), 110.72 (Support/Previous Weekly Close), 109.33 (Tested Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a low-volume shakeout (Test) or a Sign of Weakness (SOW) below 115.
- **Invalidation:** Entry invalidation if price drops below 93.96 (Jan 12 Low) on increasing volume.
---
### GNTX (BEARISH (Weakness Emerging))
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly context is 'Supply Dominance' (Confirmed Early). The recent weekly bar (Jan 12) showed high relative volume (1.43) but a wide spread closing near the low (CLV -0.017), indicating strong selling pressure absorbing demand after hitting the high of 24.53. This is a clear sign of smart money selling into the rally. The price failed to maintain gains despite significant effort.

**Key Levels:** 24.53 (Recent Supply Level), 23.35 (Immediate Support/Previous Weekly Low), 22.94 (Monthly Low Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry on a weak rally back towards 24.10 or a break and close below 23.35.
- **Invalidation:** Entry invalidation if price closes above the weekly high of 24.53.
---
### IMAX (BULLISH (Potential Accumulation/Change of Character))
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Monthly) / Effort to Rise (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly context is 'Stopping Volume' (Watching for Test). The latest weekly bar (Jan 12) showed high volume (RelVol 1.42) on a wide spread, closing near the high (CLV 0.91). This is a strong 'Effort to Rise' and potential accumulation, especially following the major drop in December. This movement looks like a reaction off a low, and the large buying volume suggests smart money interest defending the 34.00 area.

**Key Levels:** 37.61 (Immediate Resistance), 33.30 (Accumulation Support), 38.16 (Overhead Supply)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry long on a Test of Demand (low volume pullback) toward the 35.50-36.50 zone.
- **Invalidation:** Entry invalidation if price closes below 33.30.
---
### INVH (BULLISH (Confirmed Accumulation))
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stock is in a bearish quarterly trend, making the bullish signal significant. The last weekly bar (Jan 12) had high volume (RelVol 1.45) on a wide spread, closing near the high (CLV 0.988). This is a classic Stopping Volume or Sign of Strength (SOS) signal, indicating aggressive absorption of supply/accumulation by smart money. This reversed the sharp drop seen on Jan 5.

**Key Levels:** 27.66 (Recent High/Immediate Resistance), 25.98 (Test Support), 28.34 (Overhead Supply)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry long on a successful low-volume test of the support zone (e.g., near 26.50).
- **Invalidation:** Entry invalidation if price closes below 25.29 (Jan 5 Low).
---
### IONQ (NEUTRAL (Distribution Potential))
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Monthly) / Effort No Result (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly chart confirmed a Buying Climax in December (CLV -0.96) after a huge run. The January monthly candle shows high volume but only moderate spread, closing in the upper half (CLV 0.58). The last weekly bar (Jan 12) shows high volume (RelVol 0.90) on a wide spread, closing in the upper half (CLV 0.51). This effort is present, but the stock is failing to sustain a move past 52.00, suggesting latent supply following the previous climax.

**Key Levels:** 51.92 (Immediate Resistance), 47.33 (Immediate Support), 43.80 (Major Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a clear No Demand signal near 51.00 for a short entry, or a low-volume pullback and successful test near 48.00 for a long entry.
- **Invalidation:** Invalidation short above 52.62. Invalidation long below 46.00.
---
### IOT (NEUTRAL/BULLISH (Potential Accumulation Reversal))
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Monthly) / Test of Demand (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stock is in a bearish quarterly trend, but the monthly context suggests potential Buying Climax followed by attempts to shakeout. The last weekly bar (Jan 12) saw high volume (RelVol 1.69) with a wide spread, closing near the middle-to-high (CLV 0.38). This looks like volume coming in to absorb supply after a period of extreme weakness (previous three weeks had highly negative CLVs). This might be a reaction/rally from a climatic low.

**Key Levels:** 35.87 (Immediate Resistance), 32.72 (Swing Low/Potential Climactic Bottom), 38.77 (Overhead Supply)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry long on a low-volume Test of Demand near 33.50, or a break and hold above 35.00.
- **Invalidation:** Entry invalidation if price closes below 32.72.
---
### ITT (NEUTRAL (Rallying into Supply))
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Monthly) / Test of Supply (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly context is 'Supply Dominance' (Watching for Test). The last weekly bar (Jan 12) shows above-average volume (RelVol 1.02) on a moderate spread, closing in the upper half (CLV 0.42). This suggests strength, but the rally is occurring within a zone of potential overhead supply (183-185 range). The previous weekly bar (Jan 5) was a strong SOS (CLV 0.70), and the current bar is holding those gains. We are now testing the monthly supply zone.

**Key Levels:** 185.00 (Confirmed Supply/Recent High), 180.29 (Immediate Support), 172.72 (Major Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a successful Test (low volume shakeout) near 181.00 for long continuation, or a No Demand signal near 185.00 for a potential short.
- **Invalidation:** Invalidation short above 185.00. Invalidation long below 178.00.
---
### JKS (NEUTRAL (Potential Distribution Starting))
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly chart detected a Buying Climax signal (Watching for Test). The recent weekly bar (Jan 12) had high relative volume (1.83) but only a moderate spread, closing just above the midpoint (CLV 0.08). This is significant effort for minimal result (Effort No Result) near the high (30.90), which often follows a Buying Climax, suggesting supply is entering the market and absorbing the aggressive buying.

**Key Levels:** 30.90 (Climax High/Supply), 27.84 (Immediate Support), 26.51 (Major Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry short on a confirmed No Demand test toward 30.00, or a decisive break and close below 29.50.
- **Invalidation:** Entry invalidation if price closes significantly above 30.90.
---
### KDP (NEUTRAL (Congestion/Stalling))
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Monthly) / Effort No Result (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stock is in a bearish quarterly trend, but the monthly chart shows a potential Buying Climax setup (CLV 0.94 in Nov, followed by a low CLV December). The Jan 12 weekly bar saw high volume (RelVol 0.89) but a relatively narrow spread, closing near the low (CLV -0.81). This is Effort No Result on the downside, suggesting demand might be entering the market near 27.30, preventing a sharp drop despite the selling pressure.

**Key Levels:** 28.36 (Overhead Resistance), 27.31 (Immediate Support/Climactic Low), 26.97 (Major Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a clear break above 28.00 on strong volume for bullish confirmation, or a break below 27.00 for bearish continuation.
- **Invalidation:** Monitor 26.97. A close below here suggests bearish continuation.
---
### KEY (NEUTRAL (Trapped in Congestion))
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Monthly) / Test of Supply (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly chart confirmed 'Supply Dominance' in January (CLV 0.079). The last weekly bar (Jan 12) had high volume (RelVol 0.91) on a narrow spread, closing mid-range (CLV 0.43). This action, particularly the high volume failing to produce a wide spread, suggests demand is being met by continuous supply near the 21.40 level. This is often seen as a Test of Supply in an area where distribution is suspected.

**Key Levels:** 21.41 (Immediate Resistance), 20.56 (Immediate Support), 20.49 (Major Monthly Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry short on a low-volume break below 20.98 or a sharp rejection from 21.41.
- **Invalidation:** Entry invalidation if price closes above 21.75.
---
### KN (NEUTRAL/BULLISH (Strength in Supply Zone))
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly chart confirmed 'Supply Dominance,' indicating smart money selling pressure. However, the latest weekly bar (Jan 12) shows high volume (RelVol 1.15) on a wide spread, closing in the upper half (CLV 0.43), pushing aggressively toward the high of the range (25.24). While the initial signal was bearish, the market is demonstrating absorption of that supply. This aggressive buying is attempting to break the prior accumulation phase highs.

**Key Levels:** 25.24 (Supply/New High), 22.90 (Immediate Support), 21.89 (Major Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a successful low-volume Test of Demand near 24.00 for long continuation, or a failure/SOW below 23.00 for short confirmation.
- **Invalidation:** Invalidation short above 25.24. Invalidation long below 23.00.
---
### LHX (NEUTRAL (High Effort/Potential Reversal))
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stock is in a confirmed bullish quarterly trend, but the latest weekly bar (Jan 12) is a classic Buying Climax or Effort No Result signal. Volume is extremely high (RelVol 2.32) on a very wide spread, but the close is near the middle-to-low end (CLV -0.05). This suggests significant supply entered the market, absorbing the aggressive buying effort near 361.00. This is the first major sign of smart money distribution.

**Key Levels:** 361.59 (Climax High/Supply), 332.88 (Immediate Support), 307.15 (Major Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry short on a confirmed No Demand signal near 350.00, or a break and close below 338.00.
- **Invalidation:** Entry invalidation if price closes above 361.59.
---
### LQDA (NEUTRAL (Trapped in Supply Zone))
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Monthly) / Effort No Result (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly chart confirmed 'Supply Dominance' (CLV 0.40). The weekly bar (Jan 12) shows high volume (RelVol 1.53) on a wide spread, but the close is near the middle-to-low end (CLV -0.01). This is 'Effort No Result' on the upside, confirming that significant supply is meeting the market near 41.57. This suggests the prior accumulation phase is being overcome by distribution.

**Key Levels:** 41.57 (Confirmed Supply/Recent High), 34.37 (Immediate Support), 37.00 (Previous Open)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry short on a break and close below 37.00, or a failed rally back towards 40.00.
- **Invalidation:** Entry invalidation if price closes above 41.57.
---
### NICE (BEARISH (Weakness Emerging))
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stock is in a bullish quarterly trend, but the weekly chart shows clear 'Supply Dominance.' The Jan 12 bar saw very high volume (RelVol 1.83) on a wide spread, closing near the low (CLV -0.36). This is 'Effort No Result' on the upside, indicating significant supply entering the market near the highs (118.37), absorbing the demand. This is a potential high-level distribution signal.

**Key Levels:** 118.37 (Confirmed Supply/Distribution Top), 109.30 (Immediate Support/Swing Low), 112.88 (Previous Open)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry short on a weak rally/No Demand test toward 115.00, or a break and close below 109.30.
- **Invalidation:** Entry invalidation if price closes above 118.37.
---
### ONB (NEUTRAL (Congestion in Supply))
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Monthly) / Effort No Result (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly chart confirmed 'Supply Dominance' (Confirmed Strong) in December. The Jan 12 weekly bar saw high volume (RelVol 1.11) on a moderate spread, closing slightly above the midpoint (CLV 0.55). The high volume is attempting to push price higher, but the market is meeting resistance near 23.50. This is a Test of Supply in an area where smart money has previously shown heavy selling interest.

**Key Levels:** 23.50 (Immediate Resistance), 22.45 (Immediate Support), 22.03 (Major Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a clear No Demand signal near 23.50 for a short entry, or a break and hold above 23.50 for bullish reversal confirmation.
- **Invalidation:** Invalidation short above 23.50. Invalidation long below 22.45.
---
### PSA (NEUTRAL/BULLISH (Strength Testing Supply))
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Weekly) / Effort to Rise (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly chart detected 'Supply Dominance,' but the market's reaction suggests strong demand. The Jan 12 bar shows high volume (RelVol 1.92) on a wide spread, closing near the high (CLV 0.83). This is a massive 'Effort to Rise' (Sign of Strength) that aggressively pushed price into the 290s, potentially absorbing the supply identified earlier. This contradicts the bearish weekly signal and suggests the prior distribution was a shakeout.

**Key Levels:** 295.72 (New High/Supply), 273.70 (Immediate Support), 256.32 (Major Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry long on a low-volume Test of Demand near 285.00, or a break and hold above 295.72.
- **Invalidation:** Invalidation short above 295.72. Invalidation long below 273.70.
---
### PTGX (NEUTRAL/BEARISH (Congestion/Weakness))
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Monthly) / Test of Supply (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly chart suggested a Buying Climax followed by selling pressure. The last two weekly bars show signs of difficulty. The Jan 12 bar saw volume (RelVol 0.88) on a wide spread, closing in the lower half (CLV -0.25). This is a failed rally attempt (Effort No Result on the upside after a strong prior drop), confirming that sellers are dominant. The movement is now testing demand near 80.00 but failing to rebound strongly.

**Key Levels:** 87.44 (Immediate Overhead Supply), 78.75 (Swing Low/Support), 89.10 (Distribution Top)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry short on a break and close below 78.75, or a failed rally back towards 84.00.
- **Invalidation:** Entry invalidation if price closes above 87.44.
---
### QQQI (NEUTRAL (Low Volatility Congestion))
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Monthly) / Effort No Result (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly chart warned of a Buying Climax. The weekly charts show low volatility and tight congestion near the highs (53.50-54.80). The last bar (Jan 12) saw high volume (RelVol 1.45) but a narrow spread, closing near the low (CLV -0.026). This is clear 'Effort No Result' on the upside, indicating smart money is selling into minor rallies and supply is absorbing demand. However, the congestion is tight, indicating a pending breakout rather than aggressive distribution yet.

**Key Levels:** 54.85 (Confirmed Supply/Resistance), 53.90 (Immediate Support), 53.56 (Major Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry short on a break below 53.56 on increasing volume. Entry long on a break above 54.85.
- **Invalidation:** Wait for breakout/breakdown.
---
### RF (NEUTRAL (Supply Entering the Market))
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Monthly) / Effort No Result (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly chart confirmed 'Supply Dominance.' The Jan 12 weekly bar saw very high volume (RelVol 1.13) on a moderate spread, closing in the lower half (CLV -0.32). This is 'Effort No Result' on the upside, as the rally attempt failed under high volume supply. This indicates that smart money is actively distributing near the 28.00-28.60 zone, confirming the monthly bearish context.

**Key Levels:** 28.61 (Immediate Overhead Supply), 27.34 (Immediate Support), 29.26 (Major Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry short on a confirmed No Demand signal near 28.20, or a break and close below 27.34.
- **Invalidation:** Entry invalidation if price closes above 28.61.
---
### RGTI (NEUTRAL (High Volume Congestion))
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Monthly) / Effort No Result (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly chart confirmed a Buying Climax, suggesting supply entering the market. The last two weeks saw elevated volume (RelVol 0.52 and 0.57) but tight spreads, failing to decisively break 26.50. The Jan 12 bar closed mid-range (CLV 0.36). This high-volume congestion near the top of the short-term range (23.76 - 26.49) suggests supply is entering (Effort No Result), maintaining the bearish outlook from the monthly climax.

**Key Levels:** 26.49 (Immediate Overhead Supply), 23.76 (Immediate Support), 22.33 (Major Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry short on a break and close below 23.76 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** Entry invalidation if price closes above 26.49.
---
### RKT (NEUTRAL/BULLISH (Strength Testing Supply))
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Monthly) / Effort No Result (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly chart warns of Supply Dominance. The Jan 5 bar was a strong Sign of Strength (CLV 0.92, high volume). The subsequent week (Jan 12) saw sustained high volume (RelVol 1.27) but on a narrow spread, closing mid-range (CLV -0.15). This suggests 'Effort No Result' on the upside, meaning supply is meeting the buyers near 24.00, likely testing the overhead supply from the monthly signal. Accumulation is attempting to push through distribution.

**Key Levels:** 24.36 (Confirmed Supply/Resistance), 22.42 (Immediate Support), 23.29 (Previous Close Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry long on a low-volume Test of Demand near 23.00, or a break and hold above 24.36.
- **Invalidation:** Invalidation short above 24.36. Invalidation long below 22.42.
---
### RTO (NEUTRAL/BULLISH (Accumulation Continuing))
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Weekly) / Test of Supply (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly chart signaled Stopping Volume/Accumulation starting on Dec 15 (CLV 0.52). The Jan 5 bar was a strong Sign of Strength (CLV 0.81). The Jan 12 bar saw extremely high volume (RelVol 2.29) but only a moderate spread, closing mid-range (CLV 0.16). This 'Effort No Result' is seen as supply being absorbed by the aggressive buyers (smart money), testing the overhead supply near 32.20. The context suggests accumulation continues, but the test needs follow-through.

**Key Levels:** 32.20 (Confirmed Supply/Resistance), 30.62 (Immediate Support), 29.70 (Major Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry long on a successful low-volume Test of Demand near 31.00, or a break and close above 32.20.
- **Invalidation:** Entry invalidation if price closes below 30.62.
---
### RVMD (NEUTRAL (High Effort/Potential Reversal))
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stock has seen a massive price expansion (Monthly CLV 0.82) leading to a potential climax. The Jan 12 weekly bar saw extremely high volume (RelVol 1.90) on a wide spread, but the close was well off the high (CLV 0.24). This is a clear Effort No Result signal, suggesting significant supply entered the market (distribution) near the 124.49 high, absorbing the aggressive buying. This indicates a probable short-term, or even major, reversal.

**Key Levels:** 124.49 (Climax High/Supply), 113.33 (Immediate Support), 118.64 (Previous Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry short on a confirmed No Demand test toward 122.00, or a break and close below 116.82.
- **Invalidation:** Entry invalidation if price closes above 124.49.
---
### SA (NEUTRAL (Stuck in Congestion))
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Monthly) / Effort No Result (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly chart confirmed 'Supply Dominance.' The Jan 12 weekly bar saw average volume (RelVol 0.94) on a moderate spread, closing in the lower half (CLV -0.27). This suggests a weak close following the failed rally toward 32.29. The high volume in this tight trading range (30.04 - 32.29) points to smart money meeting demand with supply, confirming the distributional characteristics observed in the monthly context. Congestion continues.

**Key Levels:** 32.29 (Immediate Overhead Supply), 30.04 (Immediate Support), 30.88 (Previous Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry short on a break and close below 30.04 on increased volume.
- **Invalidation:** Entry invalidation if price closes above 32.29.
---
### SATS (NEUTRAL (High Effort/Potential Reversal))
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The market is in a bullish quarterly trend, but the latest weekly bar (Jan 12) signals a potential Buying Climax. Volume is extremely high (RelVol 1.96) on a wide spread, but the close is significantly off the high (CLV -0.63). This huge volume failing to close strong suggests significant supply (distribution) has entered the market near 132.25, absorbing the aggressive buying. The prior week's SOS (Jan 5 CLV 0.91) failed to generate follow-through.

**Key Levels:** 132.25 (Climax High/Supply), 121.29 (Immediate Support), 122.45 (Previous Open)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry short on a confirmed No Demand test toward 125.00, or a break and close below 121.29.
- **Invalidation:** Entry invalidation if price closes above 132.25.
---
### STAA (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
STAA is in a quarterly BEARISH_TREND, but the last weekly bar showed very high volume (RelVol 1.91) on a wide spread, down bar, closing near the low (CLV -0.04). This bar followed an extremely high volume bar (RelVol 2.72) which was a Selling Climax, closing slightly off the lows. The current bar is an intense selling effort, likely representing Stopping Volume (absorption of supply). We need a clear Test bar next week. The monthly bar is also wide spread down on high volume, indicating major selling, but the weekly sequence suggests short-term absorption.

**Key Levels:** Support: 19.40 (SC Low), Resistance: 22.70 (Potential Test Resistance), Supply Zone: 24.00 - 25.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Weekly No Supply or successful Test on low volume above 20.00.
- **Invalidation:** 19.39 (Below the SC/Stopping Volume low)

### STT (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
STT is in a quarterly BULLISH_TREND but experienced strong Supply Dominance. The last weekly bar was a very wide spread down bar (Spread 9.12) closing extremely near the low (CLV -0.98), on high volume (RelVol 1.81). This is a strong sign of institutional distribution or profit-taking against the quarterly bullish background. This signals a likely short-term correction or change of trend. The monthly bar also confirms this with high spread and high volume closing near the low (CLV -0.80).

**Key Levels:** Support: 126.20 (Previous weekly low), Supply/Resistance: 132.00 - 134.70, Target Low: 124.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Failure to hold support around 128.00 or a high volume upthrust Test into 131.50.
- **Invalidation:** 137.05 (Above last week's high)

### SYF (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
SYF is in a strong quarterly BULLISH_TREND. The last weekly bar was a wide spread down bar (Spread 6.89) on extremely high volume (RelVol 2.17), but it closed significantly off its low (CLV 0.52). This price action indicates strong demand coming in and absorbing the supply (Selling Climax/Stopping Volume). This is a favorable indication for accumulation in a bullish environment. The high volume shows major Smart Money activity.

**Key Levels:** Support: 74.95 (SC Low), Resistance/Target: 86.90 (Previous consolidation high), Accumulation Zone: 75.00 - 80.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Low volume Test (No Supply) around 77.00 - 79.00 or a strong Sign of Strength (SOS) above 82.00.
- **Invalidation:** 74.90 (Below the SC low)
---
### TRU (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Monthly Confirmed Strong)

**Smart Money Logic:**
TRU is in a quarterly BULLISH_TREND. While the weekly action has been consolidating, the monthly context shows a STOPPING_VOLUME (confirmed strong) signal (January: high spread, high volume, closed significantly off the low, CLV 0.27), indicating major accumulation last month. The current weekly bar shows a down move arrested (down bar, high CLV 0.66). The market appears to be basing for a continuation of the bullish trend after absorbing prior supply (Dec drop).

**Key Levels:** Support: 82.58 (Last week's low), Resistance/Target: 89.12 (Recent high), Accumulation Zone: 83.00 - 86.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Breakout above 88.00 on increasing volume, or a tight range/No Supply bar near 85.00.
- **Invalidation:** 81.08 (Below the recent swing low)
---
### UBSI (NEUTRAL/BEARISH WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
UBSI is in a quarterly BULLISH_TREND but the last weekly bar showed a Buying Climax signal (high volume, wide spread, CLV 0.67, but close is slightly off the high) following a strong up thrust (Jan 5th, CLV 0.80). The RelVol (1.42) suggests significant effort to push higher, but the narrow spread and slightly lower CLV compared to the previous week, suggests supply is beginning to meet demand, indicating potential distribution. The monthly bar closed strongly (CLV 0.82) but high volume suggests exhaustion.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 41.53 (Climax High), Support: 40.00 (Initial test support), Critical Support: 39.30

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** High volume down bar breaking 41.00 or No Demand/Upthrust confirmation near 41.50.
- **Invalidation:** 41.55 (New high above the Climax)
---
### USB (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
USB is in a quarterly BULLISH_TREND. The last weekly bar was a wide spread down move on extremely high volume (RelVol 1.85), but the close was significantly off the low (CLV 0.32). This is classic Stopping Volume/Selling Climax, indicating that Smart Money absorbed major supply during the weekly drop. This suggests a potential reversal or resumption of the bullish trend after shaking out weak hands.

**Key Levels:** Support: 53.20 (SC Low), Resistance: 56.20 (Recent high), Reaccumulation Zone: 54.00 - 54.50

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Low volume Test (No Supply) confirmation around 54.00 or a strong push above 55.50.
- **Invalidation:** 53.20 (Below the SC low)
---
### USIG (NEUTRAL/BEARISH WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
USIG is in a BULLISH_TREND but the weekly chart shows extreme Supply Dominance. The last bar was a tight spread down bar (Spread 0.30) closing near the low (CLV -0.41) on extreme volume (RelVol 2.61). This signifies high effort for a small result, indicating Smart Money is aggressively selling into the strength. Although the spread is narrow (typical for ETFs/Bonds), the huge relative volume suggests rejection near the highs. The low CLV confirms supply pressure.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 52.12 (Recent high), Support: 51.81 (Immediate support), Critical Support: 51.49

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 51.80 on high volume or a clear Upthrust action above 52.12.
- **Invalidation:** 52.13 (Above the recent peak)
---
### VGLT (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
VGLT is in a quarterly BEARISH_TREND. The last weekly bar, while having only a moderate spread (0.69), featured very high volume (RelVol 1.88) and closed near the low (CLV -0.53). This shows a significant effort to move lower, suggesting supply is dominating the market, consistent with the bearish context. The rally attempt from the prior week (Jan 5th) failed to hold ground.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 56.20 (Previous high), Support: 55.61 (Recent low), Supply Zone: 56.00 - 56.60

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and hold below 55.90. Short entry after rally fails.
- **Invalidation:** 56.60 (Above last week's high)
---
### WKC (NEUTRAL/BEARISH WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
WKC is in a strong quarterly BULLISH_TREND. The weekly sequence shows a clear Buying Climax signal confirmed on the Jan 5th bar (wide spread, high volume, CLV 0.77). The follow-up bar (Jan 12th) was also high volume (RelVol 1.88) but had a narrower spread and closed poorly (CLV 0.08), indicating supply has entered the market and is rejecting further upside. This suggests potential distribution at these higher levels.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 28.16 (Climax High), Support: 26.93 (Initial support), Critical Support: 24.50 (Start of climax move)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 27.00 on volume, or an Upthrust (UTAD) above 28.16 followed by immediate weakness.
- **Invalidation:** 28.20 (New high above the Climax)
---
### WRB (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Monthly Watch)

**Smart Money Logic:**
WRB is in a quarterly BEARISH_TREND, confirmed by the monthly chart showing Supply Dominance (CLV -0.82). The last two weekly bars show persistent weakness. The recent bar was a down bar (Spread 2.20) on moderate volume (RelVol 1.007), closing near the low (CLV -0.71). This sequence shows repeated failure to sustain rallies (Dec 22nd bar) followed by continued supply pressure. Trend is down, and tests of supply are failing.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 69.80 (Failed rally high), Support: 67.57 (Immediate low), Target Low: 66.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 67.50 on volume, or No Demand Test near 68.80.
- **Invalidation:** 70.00 (Above the recent high resistance)
---
### XEL (NEUTRAL/BULLISH WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Confirmed Early)

**Smart Money Logic:**
XEL is in a quarterly BEARISH_TREND, but the weekly sequence shows an interesting clash. The prior bars showed clear supply dominance (high volume down moves), but the last weekly bar was an up bar on high volume (RelVol 1.44), closing well off the high (CLV 0.46). Despite the 'Supply Dominance' label from the prior context, the last bar is acting more like a potential Sign of Strength, attempting to reverse the dominant weakness. The high volume suggests heavy buying meeting supply, but the close being in the middle suggests a temporary stalemate.

**Key Levels:** Support: 73.50 (Accumulation base), Resistance: 76.39 (Recent high), Range: 73.50 - 76.40

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Breakout above 76.40 on decisive volume, or a successful Test (No Supply) near 74.00.
- **Invalidation:** 73.45 (Break below the low of the recent consolidation)
