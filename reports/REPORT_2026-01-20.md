**VSA Status:** Monthly No Supply/Test and Weekly Shakeout

---
### CHDN (BULLISH)

---

**VSA Status:** Monthly Test/Shakeout (No Supply)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The significant monthly correction occurred on very low volume (RelVol 0.52), indicating supply exhaustion and a Test of the 268.95 support. Low supply suggests accumulation is complete, supporting a bullish continuation.

**Key Levels:** Test Low/Support: 268.95 (W5 Low/M3 Low), Resistance: 279.50 (W5 Open)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 273.70 (W5 Close area).
- **Invalidation:** 268.50
---
### CIVI (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Monthly No Supply/Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
The market is correcting on very low monthly volume (RelVol 0.41), confirming supply drying up (No Supply/Test). This validates the underlying strength and suggests accumulation is finishing around the 25.38 low.

**Key Levels:** Test Low/Support: 25.38 (M3 Low), Resistance: 26.89 (W2 Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 26.50 on high volume.
- **Invalidation:** 25.30
---
### CSX (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Demand Confirmation/Successful Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly setup suggested accumulation/test on low volume. The last weekly bar closed strong (CLV 0.69) on high volume (RelVol 1.38), effectively reversing the prior week's markdown. this confirms strong demand entering the market and clearing remaining supply below the 36 level.

**Key Levels:** Support: 34.79 (Testing Low), Immediate Resistance: 36.50

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and hold above 36.50, or a pullback entry closer to 35.50 on low volume.
- **Invalidation:** 34.75 (Breaking below the key weekly low)
---
### CVS (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort to Fall / Confirmed Distribution

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly context suggested No Supply, but the price action contradicts this. The last weekly bar was a heavy volume down bar (RelVol 1.30), closing near the low (CLV -0.72). This shows professional selling driving the price down.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 80.30 (Previous weekly close), Crucial Support: 78.12

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** N/A (Short entry below 78.12 if confirmed by volume)
- **Invalidation:** 81.77 (Breaking above monthly high)
---
### DKS (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply Confirmation/Rally Resumption

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly bar is an up-bar on below-average volume (RelVol 0.83), confirming a 'No Supply' condition after consolidating near 200. Smart Money has cleared the immediate supply, allowing the price to rise easily. This sets up a potential move to break the recent weekly high.

**Key Levels:** Support: 206.79, Resistance: 218.04

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and sustain above the high of the No Supply bar (218.04).
- **Invalidation:** 206.75 (Below the low of the No Supply bar)
---
### EMN (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Successful Test (Low Volume Pullback)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Following a large demand bar (Jan 5), the pullback on Jan 12 occurred on low volume (RelVol 0.78). Although the close was weak, the minimal volume indicates supply is thin. Smart Money likely absorbed any minor selling, setting up for a continuation of the rally.

**Key Levels:** Demand Zone: 67.30 - 68.00, Resistance: 70.40

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 69.00, or confirmation of support holding 67.32 on an up close.
- **Invalidation:** 67.30 (Below the low of the test bar)
---
### ETSY (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Successful Test (Low Volume Pullback)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Following a surge of demand (Jan 5), the pullback on Jan 12 occurred on low volume (RelVol 0.72). Although the close was weak, the minimal volume indicates supply is largely absent. This pullback is likely a healthy Test before the next push higher.

**Key Levels:** Demand Zone: 59.72 - 61.57, Resistance: 64.20

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Immediate entry on high volume break above 61.90, or patience for a tighter close above 62.00.
- **Invalidation:** 59.70 (Breaking the low of the test bar)
---
### HUM (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Successful Test (Low Volume Pullback)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The low volume on the weekly pullback (RelVol 0.58) confirms that supply is limited, indicating a 'No Supply' condition is holding. This is a healthy test following a period of strong markup, suggesting continuation of the bullish trend.

**Key Levels:** Demand Zone: 269.21, Resistance: 285.61

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry on a strong close above 275.00, confirming the pullback rejection.
- **Invalidation:** 269.20 (Below the low of the test bar)
---
### REGN (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Major Weakness / No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart shows a significant bearish move (January 2026) closing near the low (CLV -0.86) on below-average relative volume (RelVol 0.66). The preceding candle (December 2025) was a wide spread up/down bar with a high CLV (0.58), but the current bar engulfs that gain, showing heavy distribution pressure. The last weekly bar (01-12-2026) is a very wide spread down bar, closing near the absolute low (CLV -0.84) on high volume (RelVol 1.41), confirming major selling/distribution. This bar violates prior support, suggesting follow-through weakness.

**Key Levels:** 765.09 (Prior Weekly Low/Support Break), 726.43 (New Low / Potential Accumulation Level)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below the weekly low of 726.43 or a Test bar failure near 740.
- **Invalidation:** Above 785 (High of prior weak bar)
---
### RRC (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply/High CLV Closing

**Smart Money Logic:**
The ticker shows a 'Monthly_No_Supply' setup with a 'Monthly_Test_Observed'. The January 2026 Monthly bar shows reduced volume (RelVol 0.70) and a close significantly off the lows (CLV 0.258), suggesting absorption of selling pressure. The last weekly bar (01-12-2026) is a powerful reversal: moderate spread up, closing near the high (CLV 0.965) on high volume (RelVol 1.25). This is strong confirmed demand entering the market, suggesting the Test was successful. The background is shifting from bearish exhaustion to bullish initiation.

**Key Levels:** 32.68 (Weekly Test Low/Support), 34.51 (Immediate Resistance), 35.30 (Prior Consolidation High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry on minor pullback towards 33.80-34.00, or confirmed break above 34.51.
- **Invalidation:** 32.68 (Last Test Low)
---
### RYTM (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Weakness/Effort No Result

**Smart Money Logic:**
The 'Monthly_Test_Observed' context suggests prior weakness absorption. However, the January Monthly bar shows a wide spread down, closing near the low (CLV -0.38) on below-average volume (RelVol 0.59). The last weekly bar (01-12-2026) is a very wide spread down bar (Spread 14.43) on slightly below-average volume (RelVol 0.91), closing deeply into the lower half (CLV -0.71). This is significant Effort to the downside without a corresponding reversal (Effort No Result on the buy side), confirming sellers are in control and the prior 'Test' context is failing to hold price up.

**Key Levels:** 99.57 (Weekly Low), 104.71 (Immediate Resistance), 107.04 (Monthly Close Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and confirmed close below the weekly low of 99.57.
- **Invalidation:** Above 104.71 (Recent high where selling pressure started)
---
### SONY (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Major Weakness / Selling Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
The 'Monthly_No_Supply' trigger is contextually rejected by the current action. The Monthly bar (January 2026) is a wide spread down bar, closing near the absolute low (CLV -0.89) on very low volume (RelVol 0.69). This is indicative of heavy, accelerating weakness (No Demand/Vacuum). The last weekly bar (01-12-2026) reinforces this, showing a wide spread down, closing near the low (CLV -0.82) on high volume (RelVol 1.66). This suggests significant selling pressure and potentially climactic action, but the low CLV and high volume indicates Smart Money participation on the selling side/capitulation rather than immediate absorption.

**Key Levels:** 23.93 (Weekly Low/Key Support), 25.04 (Prior Weekly Close), 26.00 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 23.93 or failed rebound/Test of Supply near 24.50.
- **Invalidation:** Above 25.33 (Recent high)
---
### STAA (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Climactic Selling / Weak Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
The trigger is 'Weekly_Stopping_Volume'. The prior weekly bar (01-05-2026) showed extreme volume (RelVol 2.72) and a wide spread down, closing slightly off the low (CLV 0.036), indicating climactic action. However, the very next weekly bar (01-12-2026) is also a wide spread down bar on high volume (RelVol 1.91), closing near the low (CLV -0.042). This suggests that the initial stopping volume was either weak or immediately overwhelmed by further supply/panic. The failure to rally confirms weakness.

**Key Levels:** 19.40 (New Weekly Low), 22.12 (Prior Support/Resistance), 23.35 (Previous Support Zone)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below 19.40, confirming continuation of the down move.
- **Invalidation:** Above 22.12
---
### SYF (NEUTRAL/BULLISH bias)
**VSA Status:** Climactic Selling / Reversal Attempt

**Smart Money Logic:**
The ticker shows 'Weekly_Stopping_Volume' and 'Monthly_Test_Observed'. The last weekly bar (01-12-2026) exhibits a very wide spread down (6.88 points) on massive volume (RelVol 2.17). This volume spike is climactic, marking potential exhaustion. Crucially, the closing location (CLV 0.521) is significantly in the upper half of the bar, indicating major Smart Money buying/absorption at the low (74.95). The Monthly CLV is also negative (-0.24), confirming the Test occurred at the monthly low.

**Key Levels:** 74.95 (Weekly Low/Major Support), 81.84 (Immediate Resistance), 86.00 (Prior Support Zone)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry on a successful low-volume Test bar above 77.00, or confirmed break above 81.84.
- **Invalidation:** 74.95 (Climactic Low)
---
### THC (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Demand / Low Volume Weakness

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart (January 2026) shows a wide spread down bar, closing near the low (CLV -0.68) on very low volume (RelVol 0.35). This is classic No Demand/Vacuum selling, indicating professional selling is largely completed, or price is dropping due to a lack of buyers. The last weekly bar (01-12-2026) is a wide spread down bar, closing in the lower half (CLV -0.37) on average volume (RelVol 0.90). The selling pressure remains persistent, and without a major Stopping Volume event, the path of least resistance is down.

**Key Levels:** 194.04 (Weekly/Monthly Low), 199.00 (Immediate Resistance), 201.20 (Prior Weekly Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and confirmed close below 194.04.
- **Invalidation:** Above 202.71 (Recent high)
---
### TMO (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Supply Absorption

**Smart Money Logic:**
The trigger is 'Weekly_Stopping_Volume'. The last weekly bar (01-12-2026) is a wide spread down bar on very high volume (RelVol 1.70). Despite the wide spread, the bar closes significantly off the low (CLV 0.37), indicating major Smart Money buying/absorption of supply (Stopping Volume). This suggests a sharp shakeout near prior support/resistance levels. The Monthly chart is moderately bullish (CLV 0.57, RelVol 0.75).

**Key Levels:** 594.30 (Stopping Volume Low/Key Support), 629.87 (Weekly High), 620.98 (Prior Open)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry upon a successful low-volume Test bar or a high-CLV close above 621.00.
- **Invalidation:** Break below 594.30
---
### TPR (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result / Weak Close

**Smart Money Logic:**
The trigger is 'Weekly_No_Supply'. The prior three weeks showed bullish accumulation signs, culminating in a strong up-thrust (01-05-2026, CLV 0.57). However, the last weekly bar (01-12-2026) is a wide spread down bar on average volume (RelVol 0.80), closing near the absolute low (CLV -0.988). This is significant weakness, failing to hold the prior rally gains (Effort No Result to the upside), and the low close indicates persistent supply has overwhelmed demand, even on reduced volume.

**Key Levels:** 130.66 (Weak Close Level), 136.04 (Supply Confirmation/Weekly High), 128.06 (Prior Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below 130.66, targeting 128.06.
- **Invalidation:** Above 136.04 (Up-Thrust level)
---
### TRU (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply Test / Successful Absorption

**Smart Money Logic:**
The trigger is 'Weekly_No_Supply' and 'Weekly_Test_Observed'. The prior week (01-05-2026) was bullish (CLV 0.649) on high volume (RelVol 0.87). The current weekly bar (01-12-2026) is a narrow spread bar on below-average volume (RelVol 0.64), closing in the upper half (CLV 0.665). This is a successful, low-volume Test for Supply (No Supply bar) after the previous shakeout (12-29-2025, CLV -0.935). The background Monthly chart also shows neutral/positive development (CLV 0.278). All signs point to supply absorption and readiness for markup.

**Key Levels:** 82.58 (Weekly Test Low/Support), 87.71 (Prior Weekly High), 89.12 (Monthly High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry on confirmed close above 86.95, or pullback to 85.50.
- **Invalidation:** 82.58 (Test Low)
---
### TSLR (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Weakness / No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
The ticker is triggered for multiple bullish setups, but the price action is aggressively weak. The January Monthly bar is a down bar (CLV -0.31) on very low volume (RelVol 0.34). The last weekly bar (01-12-2026) is a wide spread down bar, closing near the low (CLV -0.71) on below-average volume (RelVol 0.63). This is textbook No Demand/Weakness following a prolonged consolidation range. Despite the previous 'Test' context, Smart Money is failing to support the price, indicating distribution is ongoing or major support has been lost.

**Key Levels:** 29.61 (Weekly Low), 31.62 (Immediate Resistance), 33.18 (Monthly High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below 29.61, confirming downward trend.
- **Invalidation:** Above 31.62
---
### UNP (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Weakness / No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
The 'Monthly_No_Supply' and 'Monthly_Test_Observed' setup is failing. The January Monthly bar is a down bar (CLV -0.053) on very low volume (RelVol 0.53), suggesting No Demand/Vacuum. The last weekly bar (01-12-2026) is a narrow spread bar on high volume (RelVol 1.01), closing slightly above the mid-point (CLV 0.297). While volume is high, the spread is narrow, suggesting effort to rally failed (Effort No Result or poor demand). Given the weak Monthly close and low volume, sellers have the advantage.

**Key Levels:** 225.00 (Weekly Low/Support), 231.02 (Prior Open), 231.92 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Confirmed break and close below 225.00.
- **Invalidation:** Above 231.92
---
### UPS (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply Test / Successful Absorption

**Smart Money Logic:**
The trigger is 'Weekly_No_Supply' and 'Weekly_Test_Observed'. The prior weekly bar (01-05-2026) was strongly bullish (CLV 0.645) on high volume (RelVol 0.87). The last weekly bar (01-12-2026) is a relatively narrow spread down bar on below-average volume (RelVol 0.77), closing near the low (CLV -0.464). This combination suggests a low-volume shakeout or pullback (Test) following the explosive move. The volume is contracting relative to the prior week's range, suggesting supply is diminished, setting up for continuation. Monthly trend (CLV 0.509) supports bullish continuation.

**Key Levels:** 106.15 (Weekly Test Low/Support), 109.67 (Weekly/Monthly High), 108.99 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry on confirmed close above 107.00, or confirmed break above 108.99.
- **Invalidation:** 106.15 (Test Low)
---
### USB (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Supply Absorption

**Smart Money Logic:**
The trigger is 'Weekly_Stopping_Volume'. The last weekly bar (01-12-2026) shows extremely high volume (RelVol 1.85) on a relatively narrow spread up bar. Crucially, the close is well into the upper half (CLV 0.322). This high volume/narrow spread/mid-close indicates a major absorption of supply (Stopping Volume). Smart Money is aggressively buying into the weakness, preventing the price from dropping further despite massive volume traded. The Monthly CLV is negative (-0.12), indicating this stopping volume occurred near the monthly mid-point, suggesting stabilization.

**Key Levels:** 53.23 (Stopping Volume Low/Key Support), 55.00 (Immediate Resistance), 56.20 (Monthly High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry on a successful low-volume Test bar holding above 53.50, or confirmed close above 55.00.
- **Invalidation:** Break below 53.23 (Stopping Volume Low)
---
### VKTX (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Climactic Selling / Demand Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The 'Monthly_No_Supply' and 'Monthly_Test_Observed' context suggests accumulation. The last weekly bar (01-12-2026) is a wide spread bar (Spread 6.46) on high volume (RelVol 1.32), closing well off the low in the upper half (CLV 0.354). This is a strong sign of Stopping Volume/Climactic Selling followed by demand entering and absorbing supply near the 29.53 low. The Monthly CLV (0.318) also confirms price stabilization/reversal attempt after the drop.

**Key Levels:** 29.54 (Weekly Low/Climactic Low), 35.20 (Immediate Resistance), 36.00 (Weekly High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry on a low-volume Test bar holding above 32.00, or confirmed close above 36.00.
- **Invalidation:** 29.54 (Climactic Low)
---
### WRB (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Weakness / Persistent Selling

**Smart Money Logic:**
The 'Monthly_No_Supply' trigger is contradicted by recent weakness. The January Monthly bar is a wide spread down bar, closing near the low (CLV -0.82) on low volume (RelVol 0.68). This confirms accelerating weakness and low demand. The last weekly bar (01-12-2026) reinforces this, showing a wide spread down on high volume (RelVol 1.007), closing near the low (CLV -0.719). This is a sign of continued heavy selling pressure that is not being absorbed effectively by demand.

**Key Levels:** 67.57 (Weekly Low/Support), 68.81 (Immediate Resistance), 71.08 (Monthly High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and confirmed close below 67.57, confirming downward trend.
- **Invalidation:** Above 69.78 (Recent high)
---
### WYNN (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Major Weakness / No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart (January 2026) shows a wide spread down bar, closing near the absolute low (CLV -0.89) on extremely low volume (RelVol 0.29). This is an aggressive sign of No Demand and weakness, indicating price is dropping due to a lack of buyer interest, and prior distribution is succeeding. The last weekly bar (01-12-2026) is a wide spread down bar, closing near the low (CLV -0.78) on below-average volume (RelVol 0.86). The market confirms persistent weakness.

**Key Levels:** 113.81 (Weekly/Monthly Low), 117.83 (Prior Support), 120.08 (Monthly Open)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and confirmed close below 113.81.
- **Invalidation:** Above 118.75 (Recent high)
---
### YPF (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Weakness/No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
The 'Monthly_No_Supply' and 'Monthly_Test_Observed' context is invalidated by recent price action. The January Monthly bar is a wide spread down bar (CLV -0.215) on very low volume (RelVol 0.43). This is textbook No Demand/Weakness. The last weekly bar (01-12-2026) is a down bar on below-average volume (RelVol 0.73), closing near the low (CLV -0.057). The overall picture is sellers controlling the market in a low-activity environment, suggesting distribution pressure.

**Key Levels:** 33.32 (Weekly Low/Support), 35.42 (Immediate Resistance), 36.29 (Prior Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and confirmed close below 33.32.
- **Invalidation:** Above 35.42
---
### YUMC (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Weakness / No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
The 'Monthly_No_Supply' and 'Monthly_Test_Observed' context is failing. The January Monthly bar is a down bar (CLV -0.275) on extremely low volume (RelVol 0.25). This low volume/negative close combination is classic No Demand/Weakness. The last weekly bar (01-12-2026) is a wide spread down bar on high volume (RelVol 1.009), closing near the low (CLV -0.562). This indicates a significant presence of sellers and confirms the trend of weakness, as the volume failed to generate a reversal signal (poor CLV).

**Key Levels:** 47.06 (Weekly Low/Support), 48.28 (Monthly Open/Resistance), 49.30 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Confirmed break and close below 47.06.
- **Invalidation:** Above 49.30
---
### ZBH (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Major Weakness / Selling Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
The 'Monthly_No_Supply' and 'Monthly_Test_Observed' context is failing aggressively. The January Monthly bar is a wide spread down bar, closing near the low (CLV -0.675) on below-average volume (RelVol 0.79). The last weekly bar (01-12-2026) is a very wide spread down bar (Spread 7.86) on extremely high volume (RelVol 1.95), closing poorly (CLV -0.605). This is strong confirmation of heavy selling pressure, possibly capitulation/selling climax, but the lack of a strong CLV bounce suggests Smart Money is participating in the selling or waiting lower. Weakness dominates.

**Key Levels:** 85.76 (Weekly Low/Climax Level), 92.80 (Prior Open/Resistance), 95.32 (Weekly/Monthly High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 85.76 or a failed low-volume Test of Supply near 88.00.
- **Invalidation:** Above 90.79
---
### ZM (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Major Weakness / No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
The 'Monthly_No_Supply' trigger is confirmed by current weakness. The January Monthly bar is a wide spread down bar, closing near the absolute low (CLV -0.89) on low volume (RelVol 0.51). This is a strong sign of No Demand/Vacuum, indicating professional selling is succeeding with minimal opposition. The last weekly bar (01-12-2026) is a wide spread down bar (Spread 7.33) on high volume (RelVol 1.11), closing near the low (CLV -0.89). This confirms aggressive selling and sustained downward pressure.

**Key Levels:** 80.58 (Weekly/Monthly Low), 85.18 (Prior Support), 87.92 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and confirmed close below 80.58.
- **Invalidation:** Above 87.25

## 👀 Watch/Monitoring
### ABNB (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort to Decline (Weekly)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 129.00 for short continuation.

---
### ABT (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax / Effort to Decline

**Smart Money Logic:**
Weekly chart shows high volume, wide spread down, closing on the low (CLV -0.91). This is strong bearish momentum, suggesting institutional selling or distribution is dominating. The monthly weakness confirms this outlook.

**Key Levels:** Recent Low Support: 121.53 (W5 Low/M3 Low), Resistance: 126.40 (W5 Open), Prior Support Zone: 120.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 121.50 for continuation.
- **Invalidation:** 125.28
---
### ACM (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Weekly Selling Climax (Weak Close)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Very high weekly volume suggests Smart Money involvement (potentially Stopping Volume), but the close near the low (CLV -0.076) indicates selling pressure retained control despite the spike in transactions. Requires confirmation of demand next week.

**Key Levels:** Climactic Low: 96.09 (W5 Low), Resistance: 100.56 (W4 High), Support: 95.21 (M3 Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 99.09 (W5 Open) on strong volume.
- **Invalidation:** 96.00
---
### ADSK (CAUTIOUS BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Weekly Selling Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly bar shows a massive spike in volume (RelVol 2.06) on a wide down bar, often signaling a Selling Climax or capitulation near the long-term monthly support (259.27). Given the bullish market, this is likely accumulation underway.

**Key Levels:** Selling Climax Low: 259.27 (M3 Low), Immediate Resistance: 275.91 (W5 Open), Invalidation Zone: 250.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Strong reversal bar confirmation above 270.00.
- **Invalidation:** 259.00
---
### AEO (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Monthly Shakeout/Test (Weak Weekly Close)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly chart (M3) shows a sharp price drop on very low volume (RelVol 0.51), suggesting a successful shakeout/test of the 23.88 level. However, the weekly bar closed weakly near the low, indicating current supply needs further absorption.

**Key Levels:** Test Support: 23.88 (M3 Low), Resistance: 27.71 (W1 Close), W5 Open: 24.28

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close above 25.50.
- **Invalidation:** 23.85
---
### AGIO (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Monthly No Supply / Weak Weekly Close

**Smart Money Logic:**
Monthly price correction (M3) on very low volume signals supply exhaustion (No Supply). The weekly bar, however, closed very poorly near the low, suggesting lingering supply or lack of immediate institutional follow-through. Waiting for a stronger demand signal.

**Key Levels:** Support/Test Low: 26.54 (M3 Low), Resistance: 28.87 (W5 High), W5 Open: 28.10

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Subsequent weekly up bar closing strong.
- **Invalidation:** 26.50
---
### ALKT (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Extreme Weakness/Effort to Decline

**Smart Money Logic:**
Both weekly and monthly bars closed extremely low (CLV -0.89 and -0.94) on wide spreads, confirming strong bearish momentum and distribution. The low volume on the monthly chart indicates a lack of buying interest to oppose the price drop.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Support: 19.75 (W5 Low/M3 Low), Resistance: 21.93 (W5 Open)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 19.75 for short continuation.
- **Invalidation:** 21.15
---
### ALLY (CAUTIOUS BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Monthly No Supply/Test and Weekly Shakeout

**Smart Money Logic:**
The price corrected on very low monthly volume (RelVol 0.53), suggesting supply is drying up (Test). The high volume weekly bar confirms a shakeout at the 43.08 low. Expect follow-through demand.

**Key Levels:** Test Low/Shakeout Low: 43.08 (W5 Low/M3 Low), Resistance: 45.91 (W2 Open)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close above 44.00, confirming the bounce off 43.08.
- **Invalidation:** 43.00
---
### AR (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Monthly No Supply / Weak Weekly SV

**Smart Money Logic:**
Monthly correction shows diminishing selling pressure (No Supply). The weekly high volume bar suggests absorption, but the close barely off the low (CLV 0.02) indicates slow, potentially difficult accumulation. Patience required.

**Key Levels:** Support/Potential Test Zone: 31.15 (M3 Low), Resistance: 33.50 (W5 High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 32.80 (W4 close area).
- **Invalidation:** 31.00
---
### ARM (CAUTIOUS BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Monthly Shakeout/Test and Weekly Selling Climax (Weak Close)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The sharp monthly decline occurred on low volume (Shakeout/Test). Weekly volume spiked (SV), confirming massive transactions near the 102.01 low, but the close was poor. Accumulation is likely underway, but current supply is strong.

**Key Levels:** Test Low/Support: 102.01 (W5 Low/M3 Low), Resistance: 111.75 (W5 High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above W5 Open (110.94).
- **Invalidation:** 101.90
---
### AS (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Weekly No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly down bar closed poorly on below-average volume (No Demand), suggesting lack of buying support after the recent rally attempt. Price is testing the monthly low of 36.24.

**Key Levels:** Support: 36.45 (W5 Low), Resistance: 38.73 (W5 High), M3 Low: 36.24

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 36.45 for short continuation.
- **Invalidation:** 37.92
---
### AVDL (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Monthly No Supply and Weekly Effort No Result

**Smart Money Logic:**
Price is consolidating in a tight range on low monthly volume (No Supply). The weekly high volume on a narrow spread (Effort No Result) confirms a struggle but suggests consolidation/re-accumulation at key support ahead of a potential breakout.

**Key Levels:** Consolidation Support: 21.45 (W5 Low), Resistance: 21.60 (M3 High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 21.60 with conviction.
- **Invalidation:** 21.39
---
### BBY (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Weekly Effort to Decline (Failed SV)

**Smart Money Logic:**
High volume (RelVol 1.62) resulting in a weak close near the low (CLV -0.12) suggests supply is overpowering demand currently. The Stopping Volume failed to achieve a recovery close, indicating bearish momentum remains strong near the 66.00 low.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Support: 66.00 (W5 Low/M3 Low), Resistance: 70.01 (W5 High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Clear confirmation of accumulation (e.g., Test bar) or breakdown below 66.00.
- **Invalidation:** 69.78
---
### BHF (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Monthly No Supply/Test and Weekly No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
Monthly consolidation on low volume suggests supply exhaustion (Test/No Supply). The weekly low volume, narrow close (No Demand) confirms current weakness, suggesting a minor hesitation/pullback before the anticipated markup.

**Key Levels:** Support/Test Low: 63.80 (W5 Low/M3 Low), Resistance: 64.69 (W5 High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 64.70 on strong volume.
- **Invalidation:** 63.70
---
### BILL (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Extreme Weakness/Effort to Decline

**Smart Money Logic:**
Both monthly and weekly bars closed extremely low (CLV -0.97) on wide spreads, indicating strong bearish momentum. Despite low monthly volume, the extreme poor close suggests immediate demand is absent and distribution continues.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Support: 46.50 (W5 Low/M3 Low), Resistance: 54.01 (W5 Open)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a clear reversal pattern/SV, or short below 46.50.
- **Invalidation:** 50.27
---
### BMRN (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Extreme Weakness/Effort to Decline

**Smart Money Logic:**
Both weekly and monthly bars closed extremely poorly near the low (CLV -0.90, -0.93), indicating strong bearish control despite the low monthly volume. Institutional buying is absent, confirming continued distribution/weakness.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Support: 54.36 (W5 Low/M3 Low), Resistance: 58.96 (W5 Open)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 54.30 for short continuation.
- **Invalidation:** 57.00
---
### CAI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Weekly Selling Climax/Effort to Decline

**Smart Money Logic:**
Extreme weekly volume (RelVol 2.32) on a wide down bar, closing almost on the absolute low (CLV -0.03). This high volume failed to produce any meaningful reversal, indicating demand was completely overwhelmed by supply.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Support: 24.69 (W5 Low/M3 Low), Resistance: 28.81 (W5 Open)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short continuation below 24.69.
- **Invalidation:** 27.10
---
### CAPR (CAUTIOUS BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Monthly Test (Shakeout)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The sharp monthly drop occurred on very low volume (RelVol 0.42), signifying a shakeout and supply exhaustion at the 23.15 low. The weekly bar shows consolidation near the lows. A breakout is likely forthcoming.

**Key Levels:** Test Low/Support: 23.15 (M3 Low), Resistance: 25.44 (W5 High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 24.50 on conviction.
- **Invalidation:** 23.10
---
### CART (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort to Decline / Extreme Weakness

**Smart Money Logic:**
The wide spread down bar, closing very low (CLV -0.73) on high weekly volume, indicates strong bearish momentum. The monthly low volume bar with a weak close (-0.82 CLV) confirms institutional absence or ongoing distribution.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Support: 38.85 (W5 Low/M3 Low), Resistance: 41.15 (W5 Open)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short continuation below 38.85.
- **Invalidation:** 40.28
---
### CB (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Extreme Weakness / Effort to Decline

**Smart Money Logic:**
Both weekly and monthly bars show poor closes near the low (CLV -0.66, -0.80). The wide monthly spread on low volume confirms deep underlying weakness and lack of demand absorption. Selling is dominant.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Support: 299.03 (W5 Low/M3 Low), Resistance: 307.08 (W5 Open)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short continuation below 299.00.
- **Invalidation:** 306.81
---
### CDW (CAUTIOUS BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Monthly Test/Shakeout (Accumulation in Progress)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly wide spread down bar closed off the lows on low volume (Test/Shakeout). The weekly high volume indicates accumulation at the 130.44 support, although the close was mediocre (CLV -0.53), suggesting supply absorption continues.

**Key Levels:** Test Low/Support: 130.44 (W5 Low), Resistance: 133.49 (W4 Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 132.86 (W5 Open).
- **Invalidation:** 130.00
---
### CELC (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result (Bearish Rejection)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Both weekly and monthly bars show wide spreads failing to hold gains and closing near the low, despite low volume on the weekly bar. This suggests institutional rejection/distribution occurred at the 116.44 high, trapping buyers.

**Key Levels:** Resistance/Rejection: 116.44 (M3 High), Support: 100.38 (W5 Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 104.00 (W5 Open) on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** 112.00
---
### CHTR (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Extreme Weakness / Effort to Decline

**Smart Money Logic:**
Massive down movement on both timeframes, closing extremely low (CLV -0.83, -0.86). Despite low monthly volume, the price velocity and weak closes confirm strong distribution/liquidation and lack of immediate demand intervention.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Support: 187.85 (W5 Low/M3 Low), Resistance: 208.81 (W5 Open)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short continuation below 187.85.
- **Invalidation:** 202.18
---
### CLDX (CAUTIOUS BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Monthly Test/Shakeout

**Smart Money Logic:**
The low volume monthly correction suggests supply exhaustion (Test). Although the weekly bar closed poorly on high volume (ENR/Weakness), the long-term context favors accumulation at 25.15. Needs confirmation of successful absorption.

**Key Levels:** Test Low/Support: 25.15 (W5 Low/M3 Low), Resistance: 27.20 (W5 Open)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 26.00 and subsequent low volume Test.
- **Invalidation:** 25.10
---
### CNXC (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Extreme high volume (RelVol 2.18) on a very wide weekly spread, rejecting the lows strongly and closing in the upper quarter (CLV 0.76). Smart Money was aggressively absorbing supply or initiating accumulation, indicating the end of the selling pressure.

**Key Levels:** Support: 37.85 (Stopping Volume Low), Resistance: 44.78

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and sustain above 44.06 (previous weekly close) or a successful 'Test' of the 40.00 area on low volume.
- **Invalidation:** 37.80 (Below the low of the Stopping Volume bar)
---
### CPRX (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Weak Close on Test/Secondary Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly bar was low volume (No Supply indicated), but the weekly bar (Jan 12) showed high volume pushing the price to the low (22.13). This indicates residual selling/supply is still present. Smart Money is likely testing the area around 22.13, but the test result (high volume, weak close) suggests supply needs more clearance.

**Key Levels:** Demand Zone: 22.10 - 22.20, Short-term Resistance: 23.54

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A subsequent low volume up-bar closing strongly, or a high volume up-bar breaking 23.54.
- **Invalidation:** 21.90 (Breaking below key monthly low)
---
### DELL (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Poor Test / Weak Rally Attempt

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly context suggests low supply, but the last weekly action (Jan 12) was concerning. High volume on a decent spread, but the close was weak (CLV -0.09). This indicates that the buying effort encountered significant supply near the top of the weekly range (123.65). Price consolidation is needed.

**Key Levels:** Support: 117.93, Accumulation Zone: 114.79

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A definitive close above 125.00 on high volume.
- **Invalidation:** 114.75 (Breaking the recent low)
---
### FNF (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly bar experienced a significant drop on extremely high volume (RelVol 1.81), hitting a new low (50.82). This panic selling was met by massive buying interest from Smart Money, signaling potential accumulation. The market drop was aggressively rejected.

**Key Levels:** Accumulation Zone/Support: 50.82, Resistance: 54.95

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A definitive low volume Test of the 50.82 area, followed by a strong close above 53.50.
- **Invalidation:** 50.80 (Below the low of the Stopping Volume bar)
---
### FTV (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result / Consolidation Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
The high volume on Jan 12 combined with a narrow spread and weak close (CLV -0.12) suggests overhead supply remains, blocking the immediate upward move. However, the price held above the critical support level (52.65). Smart Money is likely waiting for further supply absorption.

**Key Levels:** Demand Zone: 52.65, Resistance: 56.03

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A subsequent low volume up-bar, or a break above 56.03 on decisive volume.
- **Invalidation:** 52.60 (Breaking below the recent low)
---
### HALO (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Test with Weak Close

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly bar is a low-volume down move (RelVol 0.80), indicating limited selling pressure ('No Supply'). However, the closing price near the low (CLV -0.72) shows that demand is passive or absent. Smart Money is likely testing the area around 70.75.

**Key Levels:** Demand Zone: 70.75, Resistance: 74.08

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Confirmation on a subsequent bar: strong close above 72.00 on low volume (if retesting demand) or high volume (if breaking resistance).
- **Invalidation:** 70.70 (Breaking the low of the test bar)
---
### JBHT (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Upthrust Action / Effort No Result (Weak Close)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The high volume (RelVol 1.50) failed to result in a strong close, especially after testing the high of the previous move (209.53). This implies Smart Money used the rally to distribute shares. We need to see if the support at 198.00 holds with ultra-low volume.

**Key Levels:** Support: 198.00 (Potential Accumulation/Shakeout Low), Resistance: 209.53 (Distribution High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a successful Test of 198.00 on ultra-low volume.
- **Invalidation:** 197.90 (Breaking recent shakeout low)
---
### NET (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Initial Sign)

**Smart Money Logic:**
High volume (RelVol 1.22) and wide spread, especially after the steep markdown, suggests Smart Money absorbed selling near the low (180.23). While the close was poor (CLV -0.37), the sheer volume spike suggests the selling climax is potentially over. Confirmation of supply removal is critical.

**Key Levels:** Accumulation Zone/Support: 180.23, Resistance: 192.76

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Successful Test of 180.23 on ultra-low volume, or a strong close above 187.00.
- **Invalidation:** 180.00 (Breaking the low of the Stopping Volume bar)
---
### NICE (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Extreme high volume (RelVol 1.83) on a wide weekly spread, coupled with a close significantly off the low (109.30). This massive volume spike signifies a Selling Climax, where Smart Money absorbs heavy liquidation. This is an early indication of accumulation.

**Key Levels:** Accumulation Zone/Support: 109.30, Resistance: 118.37

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A definitive low volume Test of the 109.30 area, followed by a strong close above 113.00.
- **Invalidation:** 109.00 (Breaking the low of the Stopping Volume bar)
---
### OMC (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result / Overlapping Range

**Smart Money Logic:**
The rally attempt on high volume (RelVol 0.98) failed to close strong (CLV 0.32), indicating supply is overwhelming demand near the 81 level. This negates the immediate bullish potential suggested by the monthly trigger. The price is stuck in a consolidation range.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 81.25, Support: 76.93

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Clear break and hold above 81.25 on high volume, or a successful low volume test of 77.50.
- **Invalidation:** 76.90 (Breaking the low of the consolidation)
---
### PTGX (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Potential Test/Absorption

**Smart Money Logic:**
Following a steep markdown, the latest weekly bar shows a wide range swing on below-average volume (RelVol 0.88), closing weak but significantly off the absolute low (CLV -0.25). The low volume suggests supply is dwindling, indicating a potential test success. Awaiting confirmation of demand.

**Key Levels:** Demand Zone: 78.75, Resistance: 87.44

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Strong close above 83.00 on increasing volume, or a clear rally above 87.44.
- **Invalidation:** 78.70 (Breaking the low of the shakeout)
---
### PYPL (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The volume spike (RelVol 1.28) on a narrow down bar indicates a Selling Climax, where institutional demand absorbed heavy liquidation near the 56.24 low. This is a potential accumulation signal, halting the markdown phase.

**Key Levels:** Accumulation Zone/Support: 56.24, Resistance: 57.86

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A subsequent low volume Test of 56.24, or a strong close above 57.86.
- **Invalidation:** 56.20 (Breaking the low of the Stopping Volume bar)
---
### QRVO (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** No Supply / Weak Close Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
The extremely low volume (RelVol 0.58) on the weekly down bar confirms thin supply ('No Supply'). However, the weak close (CLV -0.66) implies demand is passive or absent, allowing the price to fall toward the low easily. Needs demand confirmation to turn bullish.

**Key Levels:** Demand Zone: 79.64, Resistance: 82.42

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A strong up-bar close above 82.42, or consolidation above 80.00 followed by an institutional entry signal.
- **Invalidation:** 79.60 (Breaking the low of the test bar)
---
### RLI (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Climactic Selling/Potential Shakeout

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart shows significant weakness (January 2026 CLV -0.58, RelVol 0.84), following a prior down month (December 2025 CLV -0.01, high volume). The overall trend suggests strong selling, but the current weakness comes on contracting volume. The last weekly bar (01-12-2026) is wide spread down on high volume (RelVol 1.12), but it closes just off the low (CLV -0.008, almost exactly on the low). This indicates potential climactic selling or a shakeout hitting long stops. Given the 'Monthly_No_Supply' trigger, we need confirmation that the selling is exhausted, which this bar doesn't definitively provide yet, but the spread is wide enough to represent climactic action.

**Key Levels:** 58.20 (Weekly Low), 60.52 (Immediate Resistance), 61.88 (Prior Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a distinct No Supply test (low volume up close) above 59.50.
- **Invalidation:** Break below 58.00
---
### RSG (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** No Supply Test (Weak Close)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly bar (January 2026) is a tight spread bar with below-average volume (RelVol 0.67) and a close near the middle/low (CLV -0.068), confirming No Supply/Low Effort. This follows a high-volume selling month (December 2025). The last weekly bar (01-12-2026) shows wide spread down, high volume (RelVol 1.24), but the close is off the low (CLV 0.137). This looks like professional buying absorbing selling on the test (Stopping Volume characteristics), confirming the monthly No Supply condition, but the close itself isn't aggressively bullish yet.

**Key Levels:** 207.90 (Weekly Low/Test Level), 212.74 (Previous Weekly High), 214.47 (Recent High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a subsequent low-volume Test or a confirmed high-CLV up bar breaking 212.74.
- **Invalidation:** Break below 207.90
---
### RTO (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Reversal Attempt

**Smart Money Logic:**
The trigger is 'Weekly_Stopping_Volume'. The last weekly bar (01-12-2026) shows very high relative volume (RelVol 2.29) on a wide spread down bar. Crucially, the closing location (CLV 0.164) is well off the low of the bar (30.62), indicating significant Smart Money absorption/buying into the weakness. However, the background Monthly context is moderately bullish (CLV 0.52). Since the prior weekly bar was strongly bullish (CLV 0.81), this week's action suggests profit-taking or a sudden shakeout before continuation.

**Key Levels:** 30.62 (Stopping Volume Low), 31.80 (Immediate Resistance), 32.20 (Weekly High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry upon a successful Test (low volume down bar) or a high-CLV close above 31.80.
- **Invalidation:** Break below 30.62
---
### RYAAY (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Climactic Selling / Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
The trigger is 'Weekly_Stopping_Volume' combined with a 'Monthly_Test_Observed'. The Monthly bar (January 2026) is a wide-spread down bar (Spread 7.04) closing near the low (CLV -0.69) on very low volume (RelVol 0.47), indicating potential No Demand/Weakness in the current bearish move. However, the last weekly bar (01-12-2026) shows extreme volume (RelVol 1.59) on a wide-spread down bar, yet the close is marginally off the low (CLV 0.013). This combination suggests climactic selling exhaustion/capitulation hitting a major support area, absorbing supply at the 67.19 low.

**Key Levels:** 67.19 (Weekly/Monthly Low - Key Support), 69.34 (Immediate Resistance), 72.02 (Prior Weekly Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A low-volume Test bar below 68.00 or a strong rally above 69.34.
- **Invalidation:** Break below 67.19
---
### SSNC (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** No Supply Test / Weak Close

**Smart Money Logic:**
The 'Monthly_No_Supply' and 'Monthly_Test_Observed' suggest accumulation potential. The January Monthly bar is a down bar (CLV -0.47) on low volume (RelVol 0.61). The last weekly bar (01-12-2026) is a wide spread down bar on high volume (RelVol 1.48), but the close is marginally off the low (CLV -0.113). This volume spike indicates selling pressure hitting the market at a perceived support level (84.48). Since the close is weak, it hasn't successfully absorbed the supply yet; it merely confirmed its presence.

**Key Levels:** 84.49 (Weekly Low/Test Level), 87.04 (Prior Weekly Close), 87.40 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A subsequent low-volume Test bar holding above 85.00, or a clear high-CLV rally above 87.40.
- **Invalidation:** Break below 84.49
---
### TD (NEUTRAL/BEARISH bias)
**VSA Status:** Weakness/No Demand Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
The 'Monthly_No_Supply' and 'Monthly_Test_Observed' suggest potential readiness for a move up, but recent activity contradicts this. The January Monthly bar shows weakness (CLV -0.227) on low volume (RelVol 0.74). The last weekly bar (01-12-2026) is a down bar on high volume (RelVol 1.29), but the close is slightly above the mid-point (CLV 0.127). This action, following a high-volume down move the prior week (RelVol 1.73, CLV -0.023), suggests continued selling/profit-taking pressure, testing 92.52. The weak bounce (CLV 0.127) indicates No Demand is entering the market following the selling.

**Key Levels:** 92.22 (Monthly Support), 92.52 (Weekly Low Test), 94.88 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 92.52 or a definitive high-volume selling bar.
- **Invalidation:** Break above 94.88

### UNM (NEUTRAL/BEARISH bias)
**VSA Status:** Climactic Selling / Weak Close

**Smart Money Logic:**
The 'Monthly_No_Supply' and 'Monthly_Test_Observed' context suggests potential accumulation. However, the January Monthly bar shows wide spread down, closing near the low (CLV -0.66) on low volume (RelVol 0.60). The last weekly bar (01-12-2026) is a wide spread down bar (Spread 6.09) on high volume (RelVol 1.44), closing poorly (CLV -0.66). This volume spike coupled with a weak close indicates heavy selling pressure or capitulation, but without strong Smart Money absorption (i.e., a high CLV close), weakness is confirmed. The monthly low of 75.07 is key support.

**Key Levels:** 75.07 (Weekly/Monthly Low), 80.15 (Immediate Resistance), 81.16 (Weekly High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a low-volume Test bar above 76.00 or a strong high-CLV close above 78.00.
- **Invalidation:** Break below 75.07
---
### WAL (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** No Supply Test / Weak Close

**Smart Money Logic:**
The trigger is 'Weekly_No_Supply' and 'Weekly_Test_Observed'. The prior week (01-05-2026) was bullish (CLV 0.577) on average volume (RelVol 0.81). The last weekly bar (01-12-2026) is a narrow spread down bar on below-average volume (RelVol 0.68), closing in the lower half (CLV -0.173). This is a textbook Test bar, but the slightly weak close suggests marginal supply remains, potentially indicating a minor shakeout or No Demand entering the market after the rally. The underlying Monthly structure is positive (CLV 0.266).

**Key Levels:** 86.68 (Test Low/Support), 90.11 (Prior Weekly Close), 90.77 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A subsequent high-CLV up bar above 89.00, or confirmed break above 90.77.
- **Invalidation:** Break below 86.68
---
### WMG (NEUTRAL/BEARISH bias)
**VSA Status:** Weakness/Effort No Result

**Smart Money Logic:**
The 'Monthly_No_Supply' and 'Monthly_Test_Observed' context is challenged. The January Monthly bar is a narrow spread up bar (CLV 0.127) on very low volume (RelVol 0.56). This indicates low interest or accumulation on low volume. However, the last weekly bar (01-12-2026) is a down bar on high volume (RelVol 1.02), closing near the low (CLV -0.648). This bar shows aggressive supply entering the market (Effort to the downside) resulting in a weak close (Result). This contradicts the perceived accumulation.

**Key Levels:** 30.37 (Weekly Low/Immediate Support), 31.13 (Prior Weekly High), 31.62 (Supply Confirmation)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below 30.37, or a high-volume up-thrust failure near 31.62.
- **Invalidation:** Above 31.62
---
### YOU (NEUTRAL/BEARISH bias)
**VSA Status:** Climactic Selling / Weak Close

**Smart Money Logic:**
The 'Monthly_No_Supply' and 'Monthly_Test_Observed' context suggests potential accumulation. However, the Monthly bar (January 2026) is a down bar (CLV -0.076) on very low volume (RelVol 0.43). The last weekly bar (01-12-2026) shows high volume (RelVol 1.17) on a wide spread down bar, closing in the upper half (CLV 0.073). While the high volume suggests climactic activity/absorption near the 33.25 low, the closing location (0.073) is poor (barely off the low). This indicates that although selling pressure was met with buying, demand was not strong enough to produce a high CLV close, confirming underlying weakness.

**Key Levels:** 33.25 (Weekly Low/Test Level), 35.85 (Prior Support), 36.36 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a definitive high-CLV rally or a breakdown below 33.25.
- **Invalidation:** Break below 33.25

## Other
### CRK (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Weakness/Effort to Fall Confirmed

**Smart Money Logic:**
Despite the 'Monthly No Supply' trigger context, recent weekly action shows increasing effort (high volume) resulting in poor upward movement and weak closes. This structure implies persistent selling pressure and potential continued markdown, rejecting the immediate bullish setup.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Resistance: 22.50, Crucial Support: 20.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** N/A (Short bias: Entry below 20.00)

---
### CVI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result / Weak Test Follow-through

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Jan 5 weekly bar was a major sign of distribution. The subsequent rally attempt (Jan 12) was high volume on a wide spread but closed flat (CLV 0.02), signifying heavy overhead supply absorbing the buying effort. Smart Money is not yet supporting this level.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 24.70, Critical Support: 21.83 (Last Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** N/A (Wait for clear accumulation or short entry below 21.83)

---
### DVA (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax / Markdown Acceleration

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Jan 12 weekly bar shows heavy selling (RelVol 1.41) over a huge spread, suggesting panic selling or forced distribution. The sheer scale of the volume and the breakdown below recent ranges indicates Smart Money is participating in the distribution or a major shakeout is underway.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Resistance: 111.72, New Low Support: 101.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** N/A (Short bias below 101.00)
- **Invalidation:** 111.75 (Needs to reclaim the previous accumulation area)

### EQH (BEARISH)

**Smart Money Logic:**

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 47.94 (Previous Support), Immediate Support: 46.38

- **Invalidation:** 48.50 (If price reclaims previous support)
---
### ESTC (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax / Extreme Weakness

**Smart Money Logic:**

---
### FOXA (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Weakness Confirmed / Effort to Fall

**Smart Money Logic:**
The low monthly volume (RelVol 0.50) failed to result in a positive close, signaling lack of demand support. The recent weekly bar shows above-average volume driving the price near the low (CLV -0.84). This is active distribution.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 73.68, Critical Support: 71.81

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** N/A (Wait for clear demand or accumulation)
- **Invalidation:** 74.70 (Reclaiming the previous resistance area)
---
### GEN (BEARISH)

---
### GM (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result (Failed Rally)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Following a large buying effort (Jan 5), the Jan 12 bar saw volume similar to the average, but the price closed decisively weak (CLV -0.67). This indicates that the selling pressure (supply) remains strong and absorbed the bullish efforts, pushing the price back toward the recent lows.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Support: 80.23, Resistance: 83.06

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** N/A (Wait for clear demand confirmation)
- **Invalidation:** 83.90 (Breaking above the recent highs)
---
### GPN (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax / Breakdown

**Smart Money Logic:**
Extreme bearishness confirmed on both timeframes. The latest weekly bar saw high volume (RelVol 1.44) driving the price to the absolute low of the range (CLV -0.98). This is committed selling and a definitive break down. Demand is completely absent.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 74.85, New Low Support: 73.76

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** N/A (Wait for clear stopping volume or accumulation)
- **Invalidation:** 79.90 (Reclaiming the previous consolidation high)
---
### GSK (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax / Markdown Acceleration

**Smart Money Logic:**
The failure to close strong on the monthly bar, combined with a weekly down bar on high volume (RelVol 1.34) closing near the low (CLV -0.90), signals strong selling pressure and active distribution. Smart Money is driving the price lower.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Support: 48.09, Resistance: 50.87

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** N/A (Wait for clear accumulation)
- **Invalidation:** 51.46 (Reclaiming the previous high)
---
### HIMS (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result (Failed Rally Attempt)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Despite the context suggesting a test, the low monthly volume indicated lack of demand, leading to a continued markdown. The latest weekly bar saw a large volume effort failing to sustain a rally, closing weak (CLV -0.12). This signifies substantial overhead supply.

**Key Levels:** Support: 29.92 (New Accumulation Low), Resistance: 33.27

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** N/A (Wait for clear demand/reversal)
- **Invalidation:** 33.30 (Reclaiming the previous high)
---
### HPE (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Demand / Confirmed Markdown

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly and weekly signals confirm deep weakness. Low volume (RelVol 0.60 weekly, 0.50 monthly) on a sharp decline and weak close indicates No Demand is present. Smart Money is likely liquidating or waiting much lower. The price is falling easily through support levels.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 21.96, Critical Support: 21.42

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** N/A (Wait for clear Stopping Volume)
- **Invalidation:** 22.75 (Reclaiming the previous weekly high)

### HRMY (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort to Fall Confirmed

**Smart Money Logic:**
The price action suggests persistent selling. The wide spread down on high volume (RelVol 1.18) closing poorly (CLV -0.34) indicates that buyers are overwhelmed by supply. Smart Money is either selling or avoiding support until a lower price.

**Key Levels:** Support: 34.68, Resistance: 39.40

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** N/A (Wait for clear accumulation)
- **Invalidation:** 39.45 (Breaking above recent high)
---
### KDP (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Weakness Confirmed / Effort to Fall

**Smart Money Logic:**
The failure of the price to hold gains on above-average volume (RelVol 0.89) and the persistent weak closes (CLV -0.81 weekly, -0.36 monthly) indicate that selling pressure is dominant and demand is soft.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Support: 27.31, Resistance: 27.80

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** N/A (Wait for clear stopping volume or bullish reversal)
- **Invalidation:** 28.40 (Breaking above the recent high)

### L (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort to Fall / Weakness Confirmed

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stock failed the implicit bullish 'Test' context. High volume (RelVol 1.20) on the weekly bar, paired with a weak close (CLV -0.62), indicates Smart Money is selling or allowing the price to fall easily due to underlying distribution.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 104.58 (Previous Close), Critical Support: 101.89

### M (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort to Fall / Breakdown

**Smart Money Logic:**
High volume (RelVol 1.13) on a weekly down bar, closing weak (CLV -0.22), confirms significant selling pressure. Smart Money appears to be distributing or letting the price fall, negating any immediate bullish recovery context.

### NCLH (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax / Heavy Distribution

**Smart Money Logic:**

---
### ONON (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort to Fall / Breakdown Confirmed

**Smart Money Logic:**
High volume selling (RelVol 1.12) on a wide spread down, closing very weak (CLV -0.72), confirms that Smart Money is aggressively liquidating positions, overriding the initial 'No Supply' bullish assumption. The breakdown below 47.42 signals a continuation of the markdown.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 47.50 (Breakdown Level), Critical Support: 44.21

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** N/A (Wait for clear accumulation)
- **Invalidation:** 50.30 (Reclaiming recent high)
---
### PAYX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result / Supply Confirmed

**Smart Money Logic:**
The attempt to reverse the monthly weakness failed, as seen by the high volume (RelVol 1.04) on the weekly bar yielding a poor close (CLV -0.10). This confirms heavy overhead supply (distribution) near 114. Smart Money is either selling or waiting until supply is exhausted much lower.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 113.77, Critical Support: 108.91

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** N/A (Wait for clear accumulation)
- **Invalidation:** 114.75 (Reclaiming previous highs)

**VSA Status:** Selling Climax / Extreme Distribution

- **Invalidation:** 122.0 (Reclaiming the previous high)
---
### PLTR (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort to Fall / Breakdown Continuation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The low volume monthly bar indicated weak demand. The weekly bar confirms this, with high volume (RelVol 1.03) pushing the price down to the lows (CLV -0.84). This is active distribution, driving the price lower and challenging the monthly support.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 177.68, Critical Support: 166.35

- **Entry Trigger:** N/A (Wait for clear accumulation)
- **Invalidation:** 182.5 (Reclaiming previous swing high)
---
### PRU (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax / Extreme Weakness

**Smart Money Logic:**
Both monthly and weekly bars show decisive selling pressure. The massive volume spike (RelVol 1.67) on the weekly bar, resulting in a close at the low (CLV -0.97), confirms forced liquidation or institutional distribution. Further markdown expected.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Support: 111.58, Resistance: 117.14

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** N/A (Wait for ultra-low volume Test of 111.58)

---
### PTC (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax / Effort to Fall

The price collapse on high volume (RelVol 1.49) indicates active distribution and bearish control. The weakness seen in the monthly chart (No Demand confirmed by weak close) is accelerating on the weekly chart.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 171.33, Critical Support: 164.15

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** N/A (Wait for clear accumulation)
- **Invalidation:** 172.03 (Reclaiming previous resistance)

### QTWO (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Demand / Extreme Weakness

**Smart Money Logic:**
Price is collapsing on ultra-low volume (RelVol 0.57 weekly, 0.42 monthly), closing near the absolute low on both charts. This is the definition of No Demand, indicating no institutional support and easy markdown by sellers. Short-term bearish continuation is expected.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 69.79, Critical Support: 64.87

- **Entry Trigger:** N/A (Wait for clear Stopping Volume)
- **Invalidation:** 70.25 (Reclaiming previous high)
---
### RDNT (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort to Fall / Weakness Confirmed

**Smart Money Logic:**
High volume (RelVol 1.15) on a wide down bar closing near the low (CLV -0.87) confirms aggressive selling pressure, overwhelming the brief rally. The monthly chart also indicated No Demand. Smart Money is distributing heavily.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 77.13 (Weekly Open), Critical Support: 70.54

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** N/A (Wait for clear accumulation)
- **Invalidation:** 78.20 (Reclaiming previous close)
---
### RDVY (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result (Distribution)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Extreme high volume (RelVol 1.60) on a narrow spread up bar, failing to close strong (CLV 0.38), confirms massive supply entering the market near the highs (73.11). This effort failed to yield a corresponding result, suggesting Smart Money is distributing their holdings.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Resistance/Supply: 73.11, Support: 71.47

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** N/A (Wait for clear demand or short entry below 71.47)
- **Invalidation:** 73.15 (Sustained close above the high)
