## 🚀 Ready for Entry
### ABVX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Effort No Result Down

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence is a confirmed early Buying Climax. The monthly chart confirms Supply Dominance. The rally attempt on 2026-01-19 (CLV 0.387, Spread 12.22) was immediately followed by a high-volume, wide-spread down move (2026-01-26, RelVol 0.64, CLV -0.975). This is a strong sign of Smart Money distribution and confirmed weakness. The sharp drop on high volume indicates sellers overwhelmed buyers immediately following the brief counter-rally.

**Key Levels:** $133.10 (High of Selling Wave), $110.98 (Recent Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $110.98 low on sustained volume.
- **Invalidation:** $125.00 (High of the last two distribution bars)
---
### ACWX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Effort No Result Down

**Smart Money Logic:**
Weekly sequence is WATCH_FOR_TEST of Buying Climax, despite a BULLISH Quarterly trend. The last bar (2026-01-26) shows a wide spread up (1.84) on high volume (RelVol 1.91), but the close is near the low (CLV -0.684). This is a clear Effort No Result Up, confirming heavy selling at the high ($72.33). This is a distribution pattern following several weeks of narrow-spread, high-CLV moves, suggesting Smart Money used the rally to offload shares.

**Key Levels:** $72.33 (Climax High), $70.48 (Last Low/Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $70.48, triggering the test phase of the Buying Climax.
- **Invalidation:** $72.33 (High of Climax bar)
---
### AEVA (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly and weekly contexts are bearish, confirmed by SUPPLY_DOMINANCE status (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The recent action shows a massive up-wave (2026-01-05, RelVol 3.54) followed by immediate, high-volume drops (2026-01-19, 2026-01-26). The last two weeks saw high volume (RelVol 1.23, 1.09) with closes near the low (CLV -0.987, -0.836), indicating sellers are firmly in control and pushing price down rapidly, especially post the failed breakout attempt in the first week of Jan.

**Key Levels:** $12.30 (Previous Demand/Support), $22.62 (Recent Supply High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below the recent low of $12.50.
- **Invalidation:** $15.81 (High of the last down bar)
---
### AHR (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Effort No Result Down

**Smart Money Logic:**
Weekly sequence shows a WATCH_FOR_TEST Buying Climax, despite a BULLISH Quarterly context. The last bar (2026-01-26) displays massive volume (RelVol 3.99) but a relatively narrow spread and a mid-range close (CLV 0.151). This extreme volume, often an indicator of heavy distribution (Selling Climax when at low, Buying Climax when at high), appeared after a significant down wave (2026-01-19, CLV -0.712). The huge volume absorbed selling, but the lack of upward progress (no strong close) suggests supply is overpowering demand near $48.00.

**Key Levels:** $48.54 (Climax High), $45.37 (Recent Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $45.37 low on volume, confirming distribution.
- **Invalidation:** $48.04 (High of last high-volume bar)
---
### AIQ (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Test of Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
Monthly sequence shows CONFIRMED EARLY BUYING CLIMAX, conflicting with a BULLISH Quarterly trend. The last weekly bar (2026-01-26) shows a wide spread down, closing near the low (CLV -0.803) on reduced volume (RelVol 0.72). This confirms sellers entered the market (distribution confirmed by the climax in the monthly chart). This bar looks like a Test or markdown phase following the climax action defined by the preceding high volume bars near the highs.

**Key Levels:** $53.94 (Climax High), $51.75 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Clear break below $51.75 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** $53.94 (Climax high)
---
### ALL (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Distribution

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence shows CONFIRMED EARLY SUPPLY_DOMINANCE within a BEARISH Quarterly trend. After a rally attempt on 2026-01-05 (RelVol 1.15, CLV 0.59), the subsequent week (2026-01-12) delivered a major blow: wide spread down, extremely high volume (RelVol 2.04), and a close near the low (CLV -0.949). This massive volume surge confirms aggressive distribution and exhaustion of buying power. The last two weeks are trying to recover on lower volume, which signals weak demand.

**Key Levels:** $210.73 (Supply Zone), $191.13 (Demand/Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $191.13 on rising volume.
- **Invalidation:** $200.04 (High of last week's rally attempt)
---
### AMBA (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence is WATCH_FOR_TEST Supply Dominance in a BEARISH Quarterly trend. The bar on 2026-01-05 was a wide-spread down on high volume (RelVol 1.81, CLV -0.88), showing strong selling. The subsequent rally attempts failed to generate significant momentum (2026-01-12: CLV 0.39, but still closed below open). The last bar (2026-01-26) confirms weakness: wide spread down, closed near the low (CLV -0.678) on average volume. Selling pressure remains dominant.

**Key Levels:** $70.77 (Immediate Supply), $63.08 (Demand/Recent Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $63.08 support.
- **Invalidation:** $69.05 (High of last week's bar)
---
### ARES (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Monthly sequence is WATCH_FOR_TEST Buying Climax, consistent with the BEARISH Quarterly trend. The last two weeks show heavy selling confirmation. The bar on 2026-01-19 was a wide spread down on normal volume, closing at the absolute low (CLV -0.979). This indicates lack of demand. The bar on 2026-01-26 continues the markdown, wide spread down on higher volume (RelVol 1.19), closing near the low (CLV -0.126). This confirms that the earlier monthly climax action has led to a confirmed markdown phase.

**Key Levels:** $177.72 (Climax High), $145.46 (Key Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $145.46 support.
- **Invalidation:** $155.09 (High of the last down bar)
---
### AS (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Monthly sequence is CONFIRMED EARLY SUPPLY_DOMINANCE, conflicting with a BULLISH Quarterly trend. The bar on 2026-01-19 showed a powerful up thrust (CLV 0.981) followed immediately by rejection. The last bar (2026-01-26) was a wide spread down, closing near the low (CLV -0.788) on normal volume. This confirms the supply signaled by the monthly sequence. The failed rally suggests distribution above $38.90.

**Key Levels:** $38.91 (Supply High), $36.36 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $36.36 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** $38.91 (High of supply action)
---
### ASML (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Effort No Result Down

**Smart Money Logic:**
Weekly sequence is WATCH_FOR_TEST Buying Climax, though the Quarterly trend remains BULLISH. The stock experienced a climactic rally (2026-01-19, CLV 0.77). However, the last bar (2026-01-26) shows extreme volume (RelVol 1.96) on a wide spread up, yet closing in the lower half (CLV -0.301). This is classic Effort No Result Up, confirming heavy institutional selling (distribution) at the $1493 highs. The trend is exhausted, evidenced by the high volume failure to maintain the close.

**Key Levels:** $1493.48 (Climax High), $1385.16 (Immediate Support)

### ATO (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Weekly sequence is WATCH_FOR_TEST Buying Climax, in line with a BEARISH Quarterly trend. The bar on 2026-01-19 was a wide spread down on high volume (RelVol 1.77) closing near the low (CLV -0.584), confirming supply. The last bar (2026-01-26) continued this weakness, a wide spread down on high volume (RelVol 2.27), closing mid-range (CLV -0.223). The combined high volume and failure to close strongly suggests heavy distribution and immediate trend reversal confirmation.

**Key Levels:** $172.09 (Supply High), $164.00 (Demand/Key Low)

### AVAV (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Monthly sequence is WATCH_FOR_TEST Buying Climax, despite a BULLISH Quarterly trend. The chart shows extreme climactic action (2026-01-05: RelVol 2.09, CLV 0.87). This was immediately followed by strong supply entry. The last two bars (2026-01-19, 2026-01-26) are wide-spread down bars on high volume (RelVol 1.44, 1.21), both closing near their absolute lows (CLV -0.827, -0.926). This confirms aggressive institutional selling (distribution) after the blow-off top.

**Key Levels:** $408.25 (Climax High), $276.76 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $276.76 low.

### AXTI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Monthly sequence is CONFIRMED EARLY BUYING CLIMAX, conflicting with a BULLISH Quarterly trend. The price saw a massive high-volume rally (2026-01-05, RelVol 3.82) which constitutes the climax action. This was immediately followed by two weeks of confirmed distribution/markdown. The bar on 2026-01-19 had a wide spread down, closing near the low (CLV -0.862). The last bar (2026-01-26) attempts a recovery (up bar, CLV 0.187) but on high volume (RelVol 1.49) with only marginal price progress. This indicates heavy supply is present and the trend has reversed.

**Key Levels:** $26.66 (Climax High), $15.85 (Key Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $15.85 support.
- **Invalidation:** $20.38 (High of last rally attempt)

### BABX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Failed Rally

**Smart Money Logic:**
Monthly sequence is WATCH_FOR_TEST Supply Dominance, within a BEARISH Quarterly trend. The rally attempts (2026-01-12 and 2026-01-19) were met with immediate high-volume distribution. The last bar (2026-01-26) is a wide spread down, closing near the low (CLV -0.881) on high volume (RelVol 1.18). This confirms aggressive supply entered the market around the $53 area, absorbing the demand and signaling a continuation of the downtrend.

**Key Levels:** $53.35 (Supply High), $46.36 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $46.36 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** $53.11 (High of last supply bar)

### BAH (BEARISH)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Monthly sequence is WATCH_FOR_TEST Buying Climax, despite a BULLISH Quarterly trend. The stock showed an aggressive rally (2026-01-05 and 2026-01-19). The climax action is confirmed by the last bar (2026-01-26): extreme volume (RelVol 1.72), wide spread down, and closing near the absolute low (CLV -0.845). This is strong confirmation of institutional distribution (Selling Climax) and trend reversal/markdown.

**Key Levels:** $109.10 (Climax High), $87.20 (Key Demand/Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $87.20 support.
- **Invalidation:** $103.00 (High of last distribution bar)

### BEP (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Markup

**Smart Money Logic:**
Monthly sequence is CONFIRMED EARLY SUPPLY_DOMINANCE, conflicting with a BULLISH Quarterly trend. However, the last weekly bar (2026-01-26) shows a strong up move on high volume (RelVol 1.09) with a good close (CLV 0.408), pushing the price into new highs above $28.96. This demand action invalidates the immediate bearish interpretation of the monthly supply dominance, suggesting that the earlier supply was absorbed and a markup phase has begun.

**Key Levels:** $30.51 (New High/Resistance), $28.21 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close above $30.51.
- **Invalidation:** $28.21 (Low of last powerful up bar)

### BHP (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Effort No Result Down

**Smart Money Logic:**
Weekly sequence is WATCH_FOR_TEST Buying Climax, despite a BULLISH Quarterly trend. The price surged over two weeks (2026-01-12, 2026-01-19) into new highs. The last bar (2026-01-26) is the climax signal: huge volume (RelVol 1.84) on a wide spread up, closing near the low (CLV -0.673). This is strong Effort No Result Up, confirming institutional distribution/supply has overwhelmed demand near $75.00.

**Key Levels:** $74.98 (Climax High), $67.51 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $67.51 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** $74.98 (Climax high)

### BKKT (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Monthly sequence is WATCH_FOR_TEST Buying Climax, despite a BULLISH Quarterly trend. The massive rally ended on 2026-01-12 (Climax bar: RelVol 1.05, CLV 0.78). This was immediately followed by two aggressive down bars (2026-01-19, 2026-01-26). The final bar was a wide spread down, closing near the low (CLV -0.669) on low volume (RelVol 0.52), indicating that supply is unopposed. This confirms the markdown phase following the distribution (Climax).

**Key Levels:** $22.11 (Climax High), $12.95 (Key Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $12.95 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** $15.61 (High of last down bar)

### BKSY (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Monthly sequence is WATCH_FOR_TEST Buying Climax, within a BULLISH Quarterly trend. The rally peaked around $29.79. The last bar (2026-01-26) is a wide spread down on normal volume (RelVol 0.89), closing near the low (CLV -0.916). This signals a confirmed markdown following distribution, as demand failed to hold the price up, resulting in a low close. Smart Money is exiting.

**Key Levels:** $29.79 (Climax High), $21.80 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $21.80 support.

The last bar (2026-01-26) saw a massive surge in volume (RelVol 2.48) on a wide spread down, closing near the absolute low (CLV -0.745). This is conclusive evidence of aggressive institutional selling (Supply Dominance/Markdown). Demand has been overwhelmed, confirming a short-term trend reversal.

**Key Levels:** $63.75 (Supply High), $53.15 (Key Demand/Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $53.15.

**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Markdown

**Smart Money Logic:**
Monthly sequence is WATCH_FOR_TEST Supply Dominance, aligning with the BEARISH Quarterly trend. The price traded in a tight range ($37-$40) for four weeks before sharply breaking down. The last bar (2026-01-26) had high volume (RelVol 1.00) on a wide spread down, closing near the low (CLV -0.725). This signals the end of the consolidation and the initiation of a confirmed markdown phase. Supply is firmly in control.

**Key Levels:** $39.07 (Immediate Supply), $34.49 (Key Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $34.49 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** $39.07 (High of last supply bar)

### BWIN (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Markdown

**Smart Money Logic:**
Monthly sequence is WATCH_FOR_TEST Supply Dominance, consistent with the BEARISH Quarterly trend. After several weeks of sideways movement following the drop, the final bar (2026-01-26) provides a clear bearish signal: high volume (RelVol 1.27), wide spread down, and a close near the absolute low (CLV -0.969). This is strong confirmation that supply has emerged aggressively and the markdown phase is accelerating.

**Key Levels:** $25.85 (Immediate Supply), $21.86 (Key Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $21.86 support.
- **Invalidation:** $25.85 (High of last supply bar)
---
### CAI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Weekly sequence is WATCH_FOR_TEST Stopping Volume, conflicting with a BULLISH Quarterly trend. The massive volume on 2026-01-12 (RelVol 2.05) suggested demand was entering, but the close was poor (CLV -0.03). This was immediately followed by a markdown. The last bar (2026-01-26) is a wide spread down on high volume (RelVol 1.65), closing at the absolute low (CLV -0.986). This aggressive downside volume and poor close overrides the Stopping Volume signal, confirming strong Supply Dominance and continued markdown.

**Key Levels:** $26.85 (Immediate Supply), $23.14 (New Low/Demand Test)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $23.14 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** $26.85 (High of last supply bar)
---
### CMPO (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Confirmed Early)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence shows significant activity. The Jan 12 bar was high volume (RelVol 3.54) on a wide spread closing strong, followed by a wide-spread down bar on lower volume (Jan 26, RelVol 1.47, CLV -0.43). The last bar (Feb 2) is a narrow spread up bar on very low volume (RelVol 0.31) closing near the high (CLV 0.59). The volume profile suggests supply absorption and potential short covering/testing (low volume up bar). Given the prior rally/climax (Jan 12) followed by a short reaction (Jan 26), the current action suggests Smart Money halting the decline (Stopping Volume/Test).

**Key Levels:** $23.00 (Last week's low/Potential Test Level), $25.95 (Recent High), $22.88 (Reaction Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry above $24.34 (last week's high) with volume confirmation, targeting a break of $25.95.
- **Invalidation:** $23.00
---
### MOD (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Jan 5 week showed extreme volume (RelVol 2.84) on a wide down bar, closing mid-low (CLV -0.20), a potential Selling Climax. The Jan 26 bar shows extremely high volume (RelVol 1.78) on an extremely wide up bar, closing near the high (CLV 0.78). This is a strong effort with a massive result, suggesting Smart Money aggressive buying/absorption, likely clearing out remaining supply near the highs. Given the bullish Quarterly Trend, this is a very strong bullish bar, signaling a powerful markdown reversal.

**Key Levels:** $190.22 (Recent High/New Supply Test), $139.25 (Demand Support), $184.66 (Last Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry above $190.22 on confirming volume for continuation of markup.
- **Invalidation:** $139.25
---
### ONB (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Confirmed Strong)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly chart indicates confirmed STRONG Supply Dominance. This detection is likely based on historical action not fully visible in the 5-week window, potentially flagging a major resistance area. The recent weekly bars show stability and a recent rally. The last bar (Jan 26) shows high volume (RelVol 0.86) on a narrow spread, closing strong (CLV 0.82). This is a strong demand bar, suggesting Smart Money is supporting the price and absorbing any remaining supply. Despite the Monthly Supply Dominance tag, the weekly action shows a clear accumulation/markup phase continuing.

**Key Levels:** $24.78 (Recent High), $23.37 (Demand Support), $24.43 (Last Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry above $24.78 on volume confirmation.
- **Invalidation:** $23.37
---
### RYAAY (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume/Demand Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence is STOPPING_VOLUME (WATCH_FOR_TEST) in a BULLISH Quarterly context. The last bar was a wide spread up (3.95 points) closing near the high (CLV 0.61) on high volume (1.98 RelVol). This action suggests strong demand returning, absorbing the supply that caused the prior weeks' downside moves, and confirming the previous stopping volume event. This is an excellent sign of strength returning to the trend.

**Key Levels:** $71.36 (Recent High), $67.41 (Demand Support), $68.97 (Prior Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and hold above $71.36
- **Invalidation:** $67.41 (Low of Demand Bar)

## 👀 Watch/Monitoring
### ABT (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Weekly chart shows heavy selling (high volume, wide spread down, closing near the low) culminating in the 2026-01-19 bar. The last week (2026-01-26) shows a smaller spread up on high volume (RelVol 2.37), closing off the high (CLV 0.574). This suggests effort to rally, but the volume is excessive relative to the gain, indicating significant remaining supply (Effort No Result Up). The Quarterly context is BEARISH, confirming the downward pressure. We are watching for a Test of the recent lows or supply zone before confirmation.

**Key Levels:** $120.00 (Previous Support/Supply), $105.77 (Recent Low/Demand)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Failure to breach $110.40 resistance level, or a weak test on diminishing volume.
- **Invalidation:** $110.40 (High of last week's bar)
---
### ACLX (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Distribution near Highs

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly context is BULLISH, but the monthly sequence shows CONFIRMED EARLY SUPPLY DOMINANCE. Weekly price action (2026-01-19) showed a wide spread up, but closed near the low (CLV -0.676) on high relative volume (RelVol 1.51), indicating supply entered the market (Effort No Result Up). The last bar (2026-01-26) is a narrow spread up on high volume, closing mid-range (CLV 0.117). This implies absorption or continued resistance near the highs ($69-$76). The stock is showing mixed signals near previous highs/supply zones.

**Key Levels:** $76.50 (Recent High/Supply), $66.00 (Demand Zone)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Strong close above $76.50 on increased volume for BULLISH continuation, or a clear break below $66.50 for BEARISH confirmation.
- **Invalidation:** $66.50 (Recent support low)
---
### AGIO (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Reversal Attempt

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BULLISH, and the monthly shows CONFIRMED EARLY STOPPING VOLUME. The weekly chart shows volatility. The drop on 2026-01-12 (CLV -0.909) was quickly followed by a wide-spread recovery on 2026-01-19 (CLV 0.607). However, the last bar (2026-01-26) shows high volume (RelVol 0.76) but closes near the low (CLV -0.671), suggesting supply is still present around the $29.93 area. This suggests a battle between demand (monthly stopping volume) and short-term supply.

**Key Levels:** $29.93 (Short-term Supply), $26.25 (Key Demand/Stopping Volume Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Clear close above $30.00 on increasing volume for continuation, or breakdown below $26.95 for immediate weakness.
- **Invalidation:** $26.95 (Last week's low)
---
### AIG (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Short-term Relief Rally

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stock is in a confirmed early SUPPLY_DOMINANCE sequence with a BEARISH Quarterly trend. The drop in early January was accompanied by massive volume (RelVol 1.80, 1.74) and closes near the lows, confirming aggressive selling. The last bar (2026-01-26) is an up move on high volume (RelVol 0.73) with a strong close (CLV 0.962). This appears to be short-term demand stepping in after the large sell-off, but it must be viewed as a potential Automatic Rally (AR) within a bearish structure until key resistance is cleared.

**Key Levels:** $85.69 (Major Supply Zone), $72.11 (Recent Low/Demand)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Failure of the rally (Secondary Test) near $76.00 or a break below $72.11.
- **Invalidation:** $76.04 (Previous minor swing high)
---
### ALC (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Accumulation

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BULLISH and monthly sequence shows CONFIRMED EARLY STOPPING VOLUME. The price dropped sharply in late December/early January but quickly found support around $77.88, indicated by high volume bars (RelVol 0.77, 0.75) that closed off the lows. The last bar (2026-01-26) is a narrow up bar on lower volume (RelVol 0.61) with a mid-to-high close (CLV 0.103), suggesting a successful absorption of selling pressure and demand absorbing supply. This is a potential accumulation area/secondary test.

**Key Levels:** $82.50 (Supply Resistance), $77.88 (Demand/Stopping Volume Zone)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $81.93 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** $79.80 (Recent minor swing low)
---
### AMH (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Secondary Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
Weekly is WATCH_FOR_TEST Stopping Volume, supported by a CONFIRMED EARLY STOPPING VOLUME monthly sequence, despite a BEARISH Quarterly trend. The massive volume on 2026-01-05 (RelVol 2.52) occurred on a wide spread that closed off the low (CLV 0.142), defining a Stopping Volume action. The subsequent weeks show demand absorption. 2026-01-12 was a strong up bar (CLV 0.907). The last week (2026-01-26) saw a drop on high volume (RelVol 1.08) but closed mid-range (CLV -0.052), suggesting a secondary test absorbing the remaining supply. The volume confirms Smart Money interest in this area.

**Key Levels:** $32.65 (Supply Zone/High), $30.51 (Stopping Volume Demand Zone)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Strong close above $32.12 (last week's high) on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** $30.51 (Low of Stopping Volume action)
---
### AMKR (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Effort No Result Down

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the monthly sequence is WATCH_FOR_TEST Buying Climax. The weekly chart shows a massive rally followed by immediate supply entry. The bar on 2026-01-12 (RelVol 1.39) had a wide spread down, closing near the low (CLV -0.668), indicating strong distribution. The last bar (2026-01-26) shows a wide spread down on normal volume (CLV -0.773), confirming continued weakness following the climax. This pattern strongly suggests distribution occurred near $55.00.

**Key Levels:** $55.17 (Climax High), $47.79 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $47.79 support on volume.
- **Invalidation:** $52.56 (High of the last down bar)
---
### APH (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Distribution

**Smart Money Logic:**
Weekly sequence is WATCH_FOR_TEST Supply Dominance, despite a BULLISH Quarterly trend. The bar on 2026-01-26 shows extreme volume (RelVol 2.28) and a wide spread down, closing near the low (CLV -0.698). This high volume selling after a prior rally (2026-01-12) suggests Smart Money distribution has overwhelmed demand. This is a potential Selling Climax or a sign of exhaustion in the previous bullish trend.

**Key Levels:** $167.04 (Climax High/Supply), $140.00 (Demand/Key Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $140.00 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** $157.54 (Recent swing high)
---
### APLS (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Selling Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
Weekly sequence is WATCH_FOR_TEST Buying Climax in a BEARISH Quarterly trend. The price saw extreme volatility. The 2026-01-12 bar was a wide-spread down on high volume (RelVol 1.54) closing near the low (CLV -0.946), a potential Selling Climax or strong markdown. This was followed by a recovery, then the bar on 2026-01-26 showed huge volume (RelVol 2.29) on a wide spread that closed mid-range (CLV 0.10). The extreme volume suggests two-sided action (demand absorbing the immediate supply), making the structure unclear. Current demand appears robust enough to slow the decline.

**Key Levels:** $23.79 (Resistance), $21.10 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close above $23.79 on conviction volume for BULLISH reversal, or break below $21.10 for BEARISH continuation.
- **Invalidation:** $21.10 (Recent low)
---
### ARE (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Effort No Result Down

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BULLISH, and the monthly shows CONFIRMED EARLY STOPPING VOLUME. The stock had a strong uptrend until the last bar (2026-01-26), which showed high volume (RelVol 1.53) on a wide spread down, closing mid-range (CLV -0.546). This is a potential initial sign of weakness (Effort No Result Down/SC), but the monthly context suggests demand previously stepped in below $50.00. We must check if this sudden supply entry ($59.75) is temporary or indicative of a larger reversal.

**Key Levels:** $59.75 (Supply/Climax High), $53.14 (Demand/Key Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Successful test of $53.14 on low volume, or strong move above $59.75.
- **Invalidation:** $53.14 (Low of potential Stopping Volume bar)
---
### ARWR (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Effort to Rally

**Smart Money Logic:**
Weekly sequence is CONFIRMED EARLY SUPPLY_DOMINANCE, but the Quarterly trend is BULLISH. The major supply bar was 2026-01-05 (RelVol 2.19, CLV -0.51), followed by a Test of Supply on 2026-01-12 (CLV -0.80). The last two bars (2026-01-19, 2026-01-26) show successful efforts by demand to counter the supply, with up moves closing in the upper half of their spreads. The last bar had increasing volume (RelVol 0.91) and a positive close (CLV 0.184), suggesting absorption is occurring near the $65 area, potentially nullifying the Supply Dominance warning.

**Key Levels:** $72.00 (Immediate Resistance), $63.33 (Demand Zone)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Strong close above $72.00 resistance.
- **Invalidation:** $65.45 (Low of accumulation/rally bar)
---
### AXTA (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Up-Thrust

**Smart Money Logic:**
Monthly sequence is CONFIRMED EARLY STOPPING VOLUME within a BULLISH Quarterly trend. The price is trading in a tight range near the highs ($33-$34). The last bar (2026-01-26) shows volume dropping off (RelVol 0.65) with a narrow spread down and a close near the low (CLV -0.572). This action, after the strong momentum bar on 2026-01-12 (CLV 0.90), suggests that the attempt to drive higher (Up-Thrust) failed and supply is entering, preventing further immediate progress. This may be a shakeout/test within accumulation, or short-term distribution.

**Key Levels:** $34.50 (Resistance), $33.33 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $34.50 for bullish continuation, or break below $33.33 for short-term weakness.
- **Invalidation:** $34.50 (Resistance high)
---
### AZN (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Up-Thrust

**Smart Money Logic:**
Weekly sequence is WATCH_FOR_TEST Stopping Volume within a BULLISH Quarterly trend. The huge volume spike on 2026-01-12 (RelVol 3.30) occurred on a mid-range bar, suggesting two-sided action (demand stepping in against supply). However, the bar following (2026-01-19) was a strong up move (CLV 0.979) on lower volume. The final bar (2026-01-26) is a down bar, wide spread, closing near the low (CLV -0.833) on high volume (RelVol 1.14). This suggests an Up-Thrust/Shakeout has failed, and Smart Money used the rally to offload stock, creating an area of supply near $96.

**Key Levels:** $96.51 (Supply Zone), $92.46 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $92.46 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** $96.18 (High of last supply bar)
---
### BANC (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Effort No Result Down

**Smart Money Logic:**
Monthly sequence is CONFIRMED STRONG BUYING CLIMAX within a BULLISH Quarterly trend. The rally failed spectacularly on 2026-01-19, forming a wide spread down, closing near the low (CLV -0.965) on average volume. This confirmed the climax. The last bar (2026-01-26) is a narrow range bar on low volume, closing mid-range (CLV -0.162). This suggests a Secondary Test (ST) of the climax high, showing little demand to push higher. The weight of evidence points towards distribution.

**Key Levels:** $21.61 (Climax High), $19.67 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $19.67 support.
- **Invalidation:** $20.41 (High of last bar)
---
### BBIO (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Test of Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
Weekly sequence is WATCH_FOR_TEST Stopping Volume, consistent with a BULLISH Quarterly trend. The high volume drop on 2026-01-12 (RelVol 2.03, CLV 0.189) defined the Stopping Volume/Accumulation area around $70-$71. The last bar (2026-01-26) is a test of the previous supply high ($80.00). It is a down bar, closing mid-range (CLV -0.309) on low volume (RelVol 0.94). This Test suggests supply is not overwhelming, setting the stage for a markup phase once the $80 ceiling is definitively cleared.

**Key Levels:** $80.00 (Resistance), $75.83 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Strong close above $80.00 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** $75.83 (Last week's low)

### BBT (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Effort No Result Down

**Smart Money Logic:**
Monthly sequence is CONFIRMED EARLY BUYING CLIMAX, despite a BULLISH Quarterly trend. The price surged in early 2026, peaking on 2026-01-19 with a wide spread and an Effort No Result Down (CLV -0.041). The next bar (2026-01-26) was an up bar on higher volume (RelVol 1.02) but closed mid-range (CLV -0.072). This is a textbook Effort No Result Up, confirming that supply is active in the $29 area and the buying power is exhausting. This suggests distribution is ongoing following the climax.

**Key Levels:** $29.63 (Climax High/Supply), $27.71 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $27.71 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** $29.09 (High of last supply bar)
---
### BBWI (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Accumulation

**Smart Money Logic:**
Monthly sequence is CONFIRMED EARLY SUPPLY_DOMINANCE, conflicting with a BULLISH Quarterly trend. The last bar (2026-01-26) is an up bar on moderate volume (RelVol 0.67) with a strong close (CLV 0.610). This occurs after a markdown phase (2026-01-19, CLV -0.132) and suggests demand stepped in around $20.52. The bar structure suggests absorption and potential accumulation is occurring, challenging the bearish monthly signal.

**Key Levels:** $23.73 (Resistance), $20.52 (Demand Zone)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $22.48 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** $20.52 (Low of accumulation area)
---
### BE (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Effort No Result Up

**Smart Money Logic:**
Monthly sequence is CONFIRMED EARLY STOPPING VOLUME, within a BULLISH Quarterly trend. The price has experienced massive volume (up to 1.17 RelVol) and wide spreads, suggesting heavy institutional activity. The bar on 2026-01-19 was a down bar, closing mid-range (CLV -0.212). The last bar (2026-01-26) is a wide spread up on high volume (RelVol 0.86) but closes poorly (CLV -0.034). This is a strong Effort No Result Up, indicating supply is overwhelming demand near the recent highs ($155-$167). The previous rally looks exhausted.

**Key Levels:** $167.57 (Supply High), $136.25 (Key Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Clear break below $147.00 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** $167.57 (High of last bar)

### BFH (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Accumulation

**Smart Money Logic:**
Weekly sequence is WATCH_FOR_TEST Stopping Volume, despite a BEARISH Quarterly trend. The low on 2026-01-12 ($67.78) was defined by a massive volume spike (RelVol 2.26) and a strong close off the low (CLV 0.862), indicating Stopping Volume/Demand entry. This demand reversed the prior down move. The bar on 2026-01-19 was a test (CLV -0.919). The last bar (2026-01-26) is a wide spread up, closing mid-range (CLV 0.441) on high volume (RelVol 1.33). This confirms buying interest and continued accumulation, potentially signaling a major reversal.

**Key Levels:** $74.27 (Immediate Resistance), $67.78 (Stopping Volume Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close above $74.27 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** $68.07 (Last week's low)
---
### BNS (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Test of Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
Weekly sequence is WATCH_FOR_TEST Supply Dominance, within a BULLISH Quarterly trend. The price saw aggressive selling (2026-01-05, RelVol 1.88, CLV -0.604). The subsequent two weeks showed strong demand stepping in (CLV 0.708, 0.892). However, the last bar (2026-01-26) attempts to push higher on normal volume (RelVol 0.92), but closes poorly (CLV -0.586). This suggests the area around $76.50 is still heavy with supply, preventing a clean markup. This looks like a failed test of the supply zone.

**Key Levels:** $76.56 (Supply Zone), $74.24 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close above $76.56 for BULLISH continuation, or break below $74.24 for BEARISH consolidation.
- **Invalidation:** $76.56 (High of last week)
---
### BP (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Effort No Result Up

**Smart Money Logic:**
Weekly sequence is CONFIRMED EARLY SUPPLY_DOMINANCE within a BULLISH Quarterly trend. The bar on 2026-01-05 (RelVol 1.85, CLV -0.37) initiated the supply phase. The last bar (2026-01-26) is a wide spread up on high volume (RelVol 1.20) but closes mid-range (CLV 0.168). This is an Effort No Result Up, confirming heavy institutional supply is active near the $38.89 high, suggesting that the recent bullish momentum is running into distribution.

**Key Levels:** $38.89 (Supply High), $36.46 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $36.46 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** $38.89 (High of last bar)
---
### BRBR (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Test of Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
Monthly sequence is CONFIRMED EARLY STOPPING VOLUME within a BEARISH Quarterly trend, suggesting potential accumulation. The bar on 2026-01-19 was a strong up move (CLV 0.665) on average volume (RelVol 1.03). The last bar (2026-01-26) is a wide spread down, closing near the low (CLV -0.672) on higher volume (RelVol 1.24). This looks like a Secondary Test (ST) of the demand zone ($24.43-$21.67) that initially succeeded in reversing the trend. Although the bar is bearish, the context is accumulation. We need to see if the demand holds the next selling pressure.

**Key Levels:** $28.26 (Resistance), $24.43 (Immediate Demand)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Successful low-volume test of $24.43, or strong close above $28.26.
- **Invalidation:** $24.43 (Low of test bar)
---
### CADE (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Selling Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
Weekly sequence is WATCH_FOR_TEST Supply Dominance, despite a BULLISH Quarterly trend. The last bar (2026-01-26) showed enormous, climactic volume (RelVol 4.69) on a wide spread, closing mid-range (CLV -0.481). This is a potential Selling Climax (SC) following the sharp drop from $46.74. The extreme volume suggests aggressive selling exhaustion and demand entering the market to absorb supply. This usually marks the end of the markdown phase.

**Key Levels:** $43.58 (Immediate Resistance), $41.59 (Selling Climax Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close above $43.58 on conviction volume for BULLISH reversal, or break below $41.59 if the climax fails.
- **Invalidation:** $41.59 (Selling Climax Low)
---
### CALM (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Effort to Rally

**Smart Money Logic:**
Weekly sequence is WATCH_FOR_TEST Supply Dominance, conflicting with a BULLISH Quarterly trend. The previous month saw heavy selling (Stopping Volume, 2026-01-05). Since then, demand has been stepping in aggressively (2026-01-12, CLV 0.976). The last bar (2026-01-26) is a wide spread up on high volume (RelVol 1.30) with a mid-range close (CLV 0.463). While the close is off the high, the upward thrust on high volume, following successful accumulation signals, suggests demand is currently dominant and testing the $84 supply zone. This looks like a bullish secondary test/accumulation pattern, currently winning against the Supply Dominance signal.

**Key Levels:** $84.15 (Immediate Resistance), $79.16 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Clear break and close above $84.15 on conviction volume.
- **Invalidation:** $79.16 (Low of accumulation area)
---
### CALX (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Selling Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
Weekly sequence is WATCH_FOR_TEST Supply Dominance in a BEARISH Quarterly trend. The last bar (2026-01-26) is highly significant: extreme volume (RelVol 2.84), wide spread down, closing near the absolute low (CLV -0.935). This is a strong Selling Climax, confirming the end of the markdown phase and potential institutional demand entering the market to soak up the final liquidation. The trend is exhausted to the downside.

**Key Levels:** $57.32 (Immediate Supply), $44.25 (Selling Climax Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Rally and close above $54.61 on increasing volume, confirming absorption.
- **Invalidation:** $44.25 (Selling Climax Low)
---
### CBRL (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Effort to Rally

**Smart Money Logic:**
Monthly sequence is CONFIRMED EARLY SUPPLY_DOMINANCE, conflicting with a BULLISH Quarterly trend. The price saw extreme volatility in January, showing a strong upthrust (2026-01-12, RelVol 1.40) followed by distribution (2026-01-19, CLV -0.87). The final bar (2026-01-26) is an up bar, closing mid-range (CLV 0.118) on average volume (RelVol 0.86). This looks like a secondary test/accumulation effort, absorbing the supply that entered earlier. The rejection of the absolute low suggests demand is currently present.

**Key Levels:** $31.83 (Immediate Resistance), $27.95 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Clear break and close above $31.83 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** $27.95 (Low of accumulation bar)
---
### CBSH (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Accumulation

**Smart Money Logic:**
Monthly sequence is CONFIRMED EARLY SUPPLY_DOMINANCE, conflicting with a BULLISH Quarterly trend. The price dropped significantly on 2026-01-19 (CLV -0.85). The last bar (2026-01-26) is a narrow up bar on high volume (RelVol 1.36), closing in the upper half (CLV 0.248). This suggests the high volume is Demand absorbing the recent supply influx. The price action indicates a battle in a congestion zone ($51.56-$53.29), possibly marking the end of the supply phase and transition to accumulation.

**Key Levels:** $53.29 (Immediate Resistance), $51.56 (Demand Zone)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Clear break and close above $53.29 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** $51.56 (Accumulation low)
---
### CCOI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar (Jan 26) shows medium volume (RelVol 0.449) on a narrow-to-medium spread, closing near the middle/low (CLV 0.40). This follows a spike in January (Jan 5-12) where price struggled to maintain high closes despite good volume. The monthly chart shows a confirmed early Buying Climax in December 2025, and January 2026 printed high volume (RelVol 0.92) but closed well off the high (CLV 0.73). The latest weekly bar suggests Smart Money is not aggressively pushing higher after the monthly Buying Climax indication. The low RelVol suggests consolidation or potential weakness ahead of a potential markdown phase.

**Key Levels:** $25.05 (High Jan 19), $23.85 (Prior High Close), $20.50 (Recent Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $23.09 (last week's low) on confirmation of supply.
- **Invalidation:** $25.05
---
### CNQ (NEUTRAL/BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly price action (Jan 26) shows high volume (RelVol 1.13) on a wide spread, closing mid-range (CLV 0.17). Although classified as Stopping Volume (presumably from earlier action, like Jan 5 downturn followed by high volume rallies), the Jan 26 bar is ambiguous. It closed up but off the highs, suggesting some supply emerged near $38.32. However, the Monthly context (Jan) shows high volume (RelVol 1.61) and a strong close (CLV 0.72), indicating institutional interest in the recent up move. The latest week could be Minor Distribution or profit-taking after the high ($38.32).

**Key Levels:** $38.32 (Recent High/Supply Zone), $35.64 (Recent Low Support), $34.95 (Prior Swing High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close above $38.32 on high volume, or a low volume pullback to $36.00.
- **Invalidation:** $35.64
---
### CORT (NEUTRAL/BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
This ticker exhibits extreme volatility due to the December event (Dec 29 wide down bar, RelVol 5.58, CLV -0.79). The recent weekly bar (Jan 26) shows high volume (RelVol 1.69) on a wide spread, closing near the low (CLV -0.40). This follows the Jan 19 bar which was a high volume, wide UP bar (CLV 0.84), suggesting absorption. The Jan 26 action could be a test of the prior demand area or liquidation after the quick rally. Given the prior extreme Selling Climax event in December, this is likely part of a basing process. The 'Stopping Volume' detection suggests a significant institutional interest that is halting the downtrend despite the monthly Buying Climax indication in December (which was likely a liquidation event).

**Key Levels:** $36.80 (Recent Low Support), $47.06 (Recent High/Supply), $43.98 (Prior Up Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $47.06 or a successful low-volume test of $36.80.
- **Invalidation:** $36.80
---
### CRBG (NEUTRAL/BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly chart indicates a confirmed early Buying Climax in December 2025, suggesting institutional distribution. The Jan 26 weekly bar shows low volume (RelVol 0.64) on a medium spread, closing near the high (CLV 0.39). This low volume attempt to rally (effort) has only resulted in a marginal upward close (no clear result), suggesting weakness remains after the prior high volume phases. The price is currently trapped in a tight trading range ($29.35 - $31.50).

**Key Levels:** $31.50 (Recent High/Supply), $29.35 (Recent Low/Demand), $30.83 (Last Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry on breakout above $31.50 on high volume for bullish scenario, or break below $29.35 for bearish continuation.
- **Invalidation:** $29.35
---
### ENR (NEUTRAL/BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result (Supply Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The price is in a BULLISH Quarterly Trend but the monthly context shows Supply Dominance. The last weekly bar (Jan 26) shows high volume (RelVol 1.63) on a wide spread, closing strong near the high (CLV 0.64). This move effectively tested and reversed the supply indicated by the prior two down weeks. The high volume surge suggests demand absorption of sellers, especially given the strong close. This is a very positive sign (Upthrust in reverse or Shakeout continuation).

**Key Levels:** $22.27 (Recent High), $19.81 (Last Swing Low), $21.83 (Last Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry above $22.27 on increased volume.
- **Invalidation:** $19.81
---
### FER (NEUTRAL/BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result (Supply)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The price is in a BULLISH Quarterly Trend but the monthly context shows Supply Dominance. The last weekly bar (Jan 26) shows low volume (RelVol 0.71) on a wide spread, closing mid-low (CLV -0.30). This wide spread down move with below-average volume indicates inherent weakness, especially following the tight consolidation in the prior weeks. Although not definitive Supply Dominance, the weakness suggests Smart Money is not interested in pushing the price immediately higher. The low volume drop indicates lack of immediate demand.

**Key Levels:** $69.81 (Recent High/Resistance), $67.02 (Recent Low/Support), $68.21 (Prior Up Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $67.02 on high volume for bearish move, or a strong up bar closing above $69.81.
- **Invalidation:** $69.81
---
### ITT (NEUTRAL/BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Confirmed Early)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly chart indicates confirmed early Supply Dominance. However, the last four weekly bars show choppy action around the $180-$185 mark. The Jan 26 bar shows moderate volume (RelVol 1.07) on a wide spread, closing mid-range (CLV 0.09). This effort resulted in very little upward movement, suggesting resistance is heavy around $185-$186. Given the bullish Quarterly context, this choppy action might be a re-accumulation within a bullish trend, despite the monthly warning. The supply from the monthly context is currently being absorbed.

**Key Levels:** $185.82 (Supply/Resistance), $178.08 (Demand Support), $182.30 (Last Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry above $185.82 on high volume, confirming absorption. Invalidation if it breaks $178.08.
- **Invalidation:** $178.08
---
### KDP (NEUTRAL/BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Confirmed Early)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly chart indicates confirmed early Buying Climax. The price is currently trapped in a tight trading range ($27.08 - $28.12) with volume consistently below average (RelVol 0.5-0.7). The last week (Jan 26) shows a medium spread down bar on moderate volume (RelVol 0.69) closing mid-range (CLV 0.50). This suggests low-effort buying is prevailing but failing to break the highs established earlier in the month ($28.36). The lack of bullish follow-through despite several attempts confirms institutional distribution/absorption at the high end of this range.

**Key Levels:** $28.36 (Climax High/Supply), $27.08 (Demand Support), $27.78 (Last Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on break below $27.08 on increased volume.
- **Invalidation:** $28.36
---
### KYMR (NEUTRAL/BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Confirmed Early)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly chart shows a confirmed early Buying Climax in January. The price action has been choppy since the December high ($81.94). The Jan 12 bar was a wide down bar, low close (CLV -0.96), suggesting supply. The Jan 26 bar shows moderate volume (RelVol 0.86) on a medium spread, closing strong (CLV 0.46). This indicates Smart Money is accumulating or supporting the price above $68.28. Given the Monthly BC, the market is likely forming a trading range before deciding direction. The current action suggests the immediate reaction is stabilizing.

**Key Levels:** $77.93 (Supply/Resistance), $68.28 (Demand Support), $72.69 (Last Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry above $74.28 on increased volume, confirming upward intent.
- **Invalidation:** $68.28
---
### NFXL (BEARISH (Weak Rally/Potential Markdown))
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The price is in a BEARISH Quarterly Trend. The Jan 19 week saw extreme volume (RelVol 3.33) on a wide spread, closing mid-range (CLV -0.006), suggesting Stopping Volume/Selling Climax. However, the next week (Jan 26) shows high volume (RelVol 1.45) on a medium down spread, closing mid-low (CLV -0.53). This inability to rally strongly and the immediate continuation of weakness on volume suggests the prior buying was absorbed and selling pressure remains dominant. The high volume selling suggests a continuation of the markdown phase rather than true accumulation.

**Key Levels:** $26.01 (Recent Resistance), $23.33 (SC Low/Demand), $23.95 (Last Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on break below $23.33 on volume confirmation.
- **Invalidation:** $26.01
---
### PGY (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Down Bar on Average Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly context is BEARISH. The latest weekly bar shows a wide spread down (3.17 points) closing near the low (CLV -0.83) on high relative volume (0.85). This confirms the Monthly SUPPLY_DOMINANCE detected early. Selling pressure is strong, indicating Smart Money is liquidating. The volume is high for this downside move, validating the supply pressure.

**Key Levels:** $22.62 (Last High), $20.65 (Last Support Area), $19.12 (New Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $19.12 (potential markdown continuation)
- **Invalidation:** $22.62 (Recent Supply High)
---
### PSN (NEUTRAL (Watch for accumulation))
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Effort No Result (Down)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly context is BULLISH, but the Monthly sequence shows SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The last weekly bar closed off the lows (CLV -0.57) on high volume (0.86 RelVol) after a wide spread down (4.07 points). This suggests significant selling effort resulting in a close near the middle/low, indicating a potential reaction to selling pressure or profit taking. The large volume coupled with the down move confirms supply presence, but the close off the extreme low suggests potential absorption, setting up a test.

**Key Levels:** $74.63 (High of Effort), $69.18 (Immediate Support), $62.81 (Major Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Confirmation of No Supply Test near $69.18
- **Invalidation:** $68.85 (Break below short-term support)
---
### QQQI (NEUTRAL to WEAK)
**VSA Status:** Selling Pressure / Low CLV

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the Monthly sequence is BUYING_CLIMAX (CONFIRMED_EARLY). The last weekly bar had high volume (1.13 RelVol) and a wide spread up (1.11 points), but the close was significantly off the high (CLV -0.51). This high volume/low CLV action signals profit-taking or supply overcoming demand, confirming the Buying Climax status. Smart Money is likely distributing.

**Key Levels:** $54.67 (Weekly High), $53.56 (Immediate Support), $52.92 (Prior Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $53.56 with volume confirmation
- **Invalidation:** $54.67 (Recent High)
---
### RARE (NEUTRAL to BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Low CLV Down Bar

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BULLISH, but weekly/monthly sequences indicate strong SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The last weekly bar saw high volume (1.05 RelVol) with a decent spread down, closing near the middle (CLV -0.06). This implies supply overwhelmed the week, leading to a close significantly off the high ($25.00). This is a lack of demand after the high volume surge two weeks ago, indicating institutional selling pressure is still present.

**Key Levels:** $25.00 (Recent High), $23.26 (Immediate Support), $22.00 (Major Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $23.26 with increased volume
- **Invalidation:** $25.00 (Supply Confirmation High)
---
### RGLD (NEUTRAL (Potential Reversal))
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax / Extreme Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the Monthly sequence is SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The last weekly bar was a very wide spread down bar (47.66 points) closing near the low (CLV -0.80) on extreme high volume (1.12 RelVol). This is a classic Selling Climax or massive liquidation event. This often precedes a short-term reaction rally or a period of automatic rally (AR) and secondary tests (ST).

**Key Levels:** $306.25 (Climax High), $258.59 (Climax Low), $293.99 (Prior High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Strong up bar from $258.59 base, confirming AR start
- **Invalidation:** $258.59 (Selling Climax Low)
---
### RGTI (NEUTRAL (Potential Reversal))
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax / Extreme Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH, but the Monthly is flagged as BUYING_CLIMAX (WATCH_FOR_TEST) due to the December and January moves. The last weekly bar is a wide spread down (6.15 points) closing near the low (CLV -0.82) on high volume (0.48 RelVol). This decisive downside move on high volume looks like a final flush (Selling Climax) to complete the prior distribution, though the relative volume is below the peak from the prior two weeks.

**Key Levels:** $23.78 (Last High), $17.62 (Selling Climax Low), $18.17 (Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close above $18.37 (Next bar open/resistance)
- **Invalidation:** $17.62 (Selling Climax Low)
---
### RKT (NEUTRAL (Potential Reversal))
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax / Extreme Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH, and the Monthly context is SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The last weekly bar exhibits extreme wide spread down (4.32 points), closing near the low (CLV -0.59) on high volume (1.04 RelVol). This massive downside pressure, especially following a surge in January (Effort No Result), suggests a potential selling climax completing a distribution phase or a deep shakeout before any meaningful recovery.

**Key Levels:** $21.38 (Last High), $17.05 (Selling Climax Low), $19.08 (Prior Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Strong bullish rebound above $19.00
- **Invalidation:** $17.05 (Selling Climax Low)
---
### RLI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Down Bar Failure

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH, reinforced by Monthly SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The last weekly bar was a wide spread down (2.54 points) but closed mid-range (CLV 0.19) on very high volume (1.70 RelVol). The volume is increasing on this down move, suggesting increased selling. While the close off the low shows some absorption, the sheer volume confirms persistent supply that prevents a strong close. This indicates trapped buyers and continuing weakness.

**Key Levels:** $59.45 (Resistance), $56.91 (Immediate Support), $55.80 (Major Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $56.91 with volume
- **Invalidation:** $59.45 (Supply Confirmation High)
---
### RTO (NEUTRAL (Waiting for Test))
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume/Supply Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence is STOPPING_VOLUME (WATCH_FOR_TEST) within a BULLISH Quarterly context. The last weekly bar was a wide spread down (2.18 points) closing near the low (CLV -0.79) on high volume (1.36 RelVol). This suggests strong profit-taking or supply entering the market after a significant up move (from $29.43 to $33.46). This bar marks potential stopping volume, confirming a halt in the recent bull run.

**Key Levels:** $33.46 (High of move), $31.28 (Stopping Volume Low), $31.88 (Pivot)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Confirmation of No Supply Test near $31.28 or a decisive break above $33.46
- **Invalidation:** $31.28 (Stopping Volume Low)
---
### RYN (NEUTRAL (Watch for Test))
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Selling Pressure

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence is STOPPING_VOLUME (WATCH_FOR_TEST), with the Monthly in BUYING_CLIMAX. The last weekly bar was a wide spread down (2.11 points) closing near the low (CLV -0.20) on extreme volume (3.72 RelVol). This spike in volume is highly indicative of strong selling/profit-taking after the recent run-up, marking potential stopping volume or a sharp shakeout. The close off the absolute low provides a slight hint of absorption.

**Key Levels:** $24.82 (High), $21.90 (Stopping Volume Low), $22.74 (Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Confirmation of No Supply Test near $21.90, or decisive break above $24.01
- **Invalidation:** $21.90 (Stopping Volume Low)

### SA (BEARISH (Wait for Reversal confirmation))
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax / Supply Extreme

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH, and the Monthly shows SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The last weekly bar was an extreme wide spread down (9.86 points) closing on the low (CLV -0.97) on extremely high volume (1.46 RelVol). This confirms intense institutional liquidation/selling climax, likely completing a distribution phase after the prior week's high volume surge ($37.99). This magnitude of selling often leads to an automatic rally.

**Key Levels:** $37.99 (Recent High), $28.13 (Climax Low), $28.26 (Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Strong bullish close, signaling the start of an Automatic Rally
- **Invalidation:** $28.13 (Selling Climax Low)
---
### SARO (NEUTRAL (Wait for Test))
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax / Supply Extreme

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence is SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The last weekly bar was a wide spread down (2.69 points) closing near the low (CLV -0.91) on extreme high volume (4.29 RelVol). This is a strong sign of institutional liquidation (Selling Climax), dramatically reversing the strong up moves seen in prior weeks. This extreme supply exhaustion suggests a reversal attempt is due.

**Key Levels:** $33.46 (High), $30.77 (Climax Low), $28.62 (Major Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Clear Automatic Rally break above $31.20
- **Invalidation:** $30.77 (Selling Climax Low)
---
### STAA (NEUTRAL to BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Weak Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence is STOPPING_VOLUME (CONFIRMED_EARLY) within a BEARISH Quarterly trend. The last weekly bar was a narrow spread down (0.99 points) closing near the low (CLV -0.43) on average volume (0.75 RelVol). While the prior extreme selling has eased, the close still reflects weakness, and there is no strong rebound or demand confirmation, suggesting the Stopping Volume event was weak or distribution is continuing quietly.

**Key Levels:** $19.66 (Resistance), $18.67 (Stopping Volume Low), $19.14 (Prior Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $18.67 (Testing the bottom of the stopping bar range)
- **Invalidation:** $19.66 (High of latest movement)
---
### SYF (NEUTRAL (Potential Reversal))
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax / Extreme Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH, and the weekly sequence is SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The last bar was a wide spread down (5.71 points) closing near the low (CLV -0.73) on very high volume (2.13 RelVol). This indicates panic selling or a Selling Climax, pushing the price significantly lower. This suggests a period of reaction/relief rally is due before the next potential move.

**Key Levels:** $77.57 (High), $71.86 (Selling Climax Low), $72.63 (Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Strong bullish close, confirming Automatic Rally start
- **Invalidation:** $71.86 (Selling Climax Low)
---
### TRU (NEUTRAL (Potential Reversal))
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax / Supply Extreme

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH, but the Monthly sequence is STOPPING_VOLUME (CONFIRMED_STRONG). The last weekly bar was a wide spread down (6.54 points) closing near the low (CLV -0.87) on high volume (0.89 RelVol). This action, combined with the extreme CLV and volume, confirms strong selling pressure, potentially marking a Selling Climax or a final shakeout before the confirmed monthly stopping volume takes effect.

**Key Levels:** $85.14 (Resistance), $78.60 (Climax Low), $79.02 (Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Strong bullish bar closing above $79.49 (next bar resistance)
- **Invalidation:** $78.60 (Selling Climax Low)
---
### TXT (NEUTRAL to BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax / Supply Entry

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the weekly sequence is SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The last weekly bar was a very wide spread down (11.40 points) closing below the mid-point (CLV -0.34) on very high volume (2.08 RelVol). This significant increase in volume accompanying a wide spread down, following a recent push to new highs ($96.98), strongly suggests institutional distribution and Supply Entry, likely marking a climax/shakeout.

**Key Levels:** $95.72 (Supply High), $84.32 (Selling Climax Low), $96.98 (Prior High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $84.32 (Climax Low)
- **Invalidation:** $95.72 (High of Supply Bar)
---
### UGI (NEUTRAL to WEAK)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Effort No Result (Down)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence is BUYING_CLIMAX (WATCH_FOR_TEST) in a BULLISH Quarterly trend. The last weekly bar had high volume (2.19 RelVol) on a wide spread up (2.38 points) but closed near the low (CLV -0.029). This massive volume with an inability to close strong is classic Buying Climax/Effort No Result, signaling that supply entered the market and checked the rally. Smart Money is taking profits.

**Key Levels:** $41.34 (Climax High), $38.95 (Immediate Support), $40.11 (Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $38.95 (Low of climax range)
- **Invalidation:** $41.34 (Climax High)
---
### UNH (NEUTRAL (Potential Reversal))
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax / Extreme Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH, and the weekly sequence is SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The last weekly bar was an extreme wide spread down (74.39 points) closing near the low (CLV -0.82) on extreme volume (2.97 RelVol). This is a textbook Selling Climax, indicating a massive shakeout or institutional liquidation. A short-term bounce (Automatic Rally) is highly anticipated.

**Key Levels:** $354.79 (High), $280.40 (Selling Climax Low), $286.93 (Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Strong bullish reversal bar confirming AR start
- **Invalidation:** $280.40 (Selling Climax Low)
---
### USIG (NEUTRAL (Ranging Weakness))
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance Continuation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the weekly sequence is SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The last weekly bar was a narrow spread down (0.24 points) closing near the low (CLV -0.25) on high volume (1.03 RelVol). In this tightly defined range, the persistent high volume and inability to push significantly higher, coupled with continuous closes off the high (following prior weeks' low CLVs), confirms supply pressure is dominating Smart Money's efforts to mark up, maintaining the distribution phase.

**Key Levels:** $52.11 (Resistance), $51.87 (Immediate Support), $51.65 (Major Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $51.87 with volume
- **Invalidation:** $52.11 (Supply High)
---
### WGMI (NEUTRAL to WEAK)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result / Selling Pressure

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the Monthly shows BUYING_CLIMAX (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The last weekly bar was a wide spread down (7.62 points) closing near the low (CLV -0.82) on high volume (1.15 RelVol). This indicates strong selling pressure after the recent high at $52.01, confirming that the prior thrusts were likely climactic. Significant selling effort is yielding a downward result, suggesting distribution.

**Key Levels:** $52.01 (High), $44.39 (Support), $45.06 (Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $44.39 with volume
- **Invalidation:** $52.01 (Climax High)
---
### WHR (NEUTRAL (Potential Reversal))
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Supply Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence is STOPPING_VOLUME (WATCH_FOR_TEST) in a BULLISH Quarterly trend. The last weekly bar was an extreme wide spread down (13.29 points) closing off the absolute low (CLV 0.12) on very high volume (2.14 RelVol). This is strong stopping volume/selling climax, which halts the recent upthrust (from $74 to $90). The close off the low indicates some Smart Money absorption of the massive supply.

**Key Levels:** $90.21 (High), $72.55 (Climax Low), $79.99 (Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Strong bullish close, confirming AR start above $80.17
- **Invalidation:** $72.55 (Stopping Volume Low)
---
### WPM (NEUTRAL (Potential Reversal))
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax / Extreme Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence is SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (WATCH_FOR_TEST) in a BULLISH Quarterly trend. The last bar was an extreme wide spread down (30.03 points) closing near the low (CLV -0.89) on very high volume (1.92 RelVol). This is a clear Selling Climax, indicating significant panic/liquidation after the price hit a high of $160.36. This high volume, wide spread down, low close action should lead to an Automatic Rally.

**Key Levels:** $160.36 (High), $130.33 (Climax Low), $131.87 (Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Strong bullish reversal bar confirming AR start
- **Invalidation:** $130.33 (Selling Climax Low)
---
### WRB (NEUTRAL to BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Demand Return / Absorption

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH, but the Monthly sequence is SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The last weekly bar was a wide spread up (4.90 points), closing near the high (CLV 0.45) on high volume (1.07 RelVol). While the spread is wide, the CLV suggests the price closed strongly off the low ($65.02). This indicates demand successfully absorbed selling pressure throughout the week, setting up a potential challenge to the recent downtrend resistance.

**Key Levels:** $69.92 (Resistance), $65.02 (Demand Low), $68.76 (Pivot)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and hold above $69.92 with volume
- **Invalidation:** $65.02 (Demand Bar Low)
---
### ZM (NEUTRAL to WEAK)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Effort No Result (Up)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH. The last weekly bar was a very wide spread up (11.17 points), closing near the low (CLV 0.019) on extremely high volume (2.00 RelVol). This is classic Buying Climax/Effort No Result. The massive effort (volume) failed to yield a strong bullish result (closed barely above the low/open). This confirms institutional supply entering the market and dominating the close.

**Key Levels:** $97.58 (Climax High), $86.40 (Immediate Support), $92.10 (Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $86.40 (Climax Low)
- **Invalidation:** $97.58 (Climax High)
---
## Other
### CDE (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar (Jan 26) shows extreme volume (RelVol 2.03) on an extremely wide spread, closing near the low (CLV -0.89). This is a classic example of Supply Dominance/Selling Climax behavior, but within a strong quarterly BULLISH trend context and following a confirmed monthly Buying Climax (Jan 19 high at $26.50). The massive volume surge suggests heavy institutional selling or long liquidation (distribution). Given the prior bullish trend, this wide-spread, high-volume down move is a major sign of weakness, likely marking the commencement of a secondary test or correction. This is an automatic reaction (AR) after the rally. The monthly chart confirms this extreme price action (Jan high $27.77, close $20.44 with RelVol 1.92).

**Key Levels:** $27.77 (Recent High), $20.02 (Last week's low/SC level), $23.25 (Prior Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on failure of a rally back towards $23-$25 zone (Secondary Test) on low volume.
- **Invalidation:** $27.77
---
### CIVI (NEUTRAL/BEARISH (Anticipating Correction))
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar (Jan 26) shows extremely high volume (RelVol 2.71) on a wide spread, but the close is middling (CLV -0.42). This volume is far above average and occurred after the price made a high of $29.20. This indicates a major increase in selling pressure (Smart Money distributing) absorbing the demand. The initial Buying Climax detection (Jan 26 week) is warranted by the massive volume and the inability to close strongly. The price action suggests Smart Money is unloading shares into strength.

**Key Levels:** $29.20 (Buying Climax High), $26.64 (Last week's low), $27.50 (Potential ST Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on weakness confirmed by a break below $26.64 or a failed rally (ST) on low volume.
- **Invalidation:** $29.20
---
### CNXC (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The price is in a Quarterly BEARISH Trend. The latest weekly bar (Jan 26) shows high volume (RelVol 1.20) on a very wide spread, closing near the low (CLV -0.63). This is a potential Selling Climax/Stopping Volume event, potentially marking the bottom of a steep correction. The high volume surge at the extreme low of the move suggests Smart Money buying absorption. The last monthly bar (Jan) confirms extreme selling (RelVol 1.47, CLV -0.69). We are watching for confirmation of this absorption.

**Key Levels:** $35.66 (Selling Climax Low), $43.03 (Supply Level), $37.00 (Last Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry on a successful, low-volume Secondary Test of the $35.66 level, confirmed by a strong up bar.
- **Invalidation:** $35.66
---
### CPNG (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BEARISH. The last weekly bar (Jan 26) shows extreme volume (RelVol 2.56) on a wide spread, but the close is mid-range (CLV 0.32). This massive volume in a continuing downtrend, particularly closing off the lows ($18.55), indicates a potential Selling Climax and preliminary signs of absorption (Stopping Volume). However, the overall weekly and monthly sequence shows continuous supply absorption (Supply Dominance/BC). The high volume might signify that Smart Money is accumulating, but currently, supply dominates the sequence. The price did not manage to break higher on this volume spike. We require confirmation of demand.

**Key Levels:** $20.97 (Recent High), $18.55 (Selling Climax Low), $23.37 (Prior Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A definitive, low-volume Secondary Test near $18.55, followed by a strong reversal candle.
- **Invalidation:** $18.55 (Tight Stop)
---
### CSGP (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The price is in a BEARISH Quarterly Trend. The last weekly bar (Jan 26) shows high volume (RelVol 1.63) on a wide down spread, closing near the low (CLV -0.85). This is classic Supply Dominance, confirming the bear sequence from earlier January (Jan 5 high volume down bar, CLV -0.98). Smart Money is clearly selling or defending the high ground. The monthly chart confirms Supply Dominance with a high-volume wide down bar (Jan, RelVol 2.12, CLV -0.72).

**Key Levels:** $70.57 (Supply High), $60.77 (Recent Low Support), $65.95 (Prior Open/Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on break below $60.77 on high volume, confirming markdown continuation.
- **Invalidation:** $67.80 (Mid-range resistance)
---
### CTRA (BEARISH (Anticipating Reaction))
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Confirmed Early)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar (Jan 26) shows high volume (RelVol 1.12) on a wide spread, closing near the high (CLV 0.79). Although strong, this extreme volume at new highs, following the high volume action in early January (Jan 12, RelVol 2.07), indicates potential absorption by Smart Money (Buying Climax behavior). The confirmed early BC suggests distribution is likely underway. The rally to $29.06 occurred on high effort, indicating Smart Money is meeting resistance here.

**Key Levels:** $29.06 (Climax High), $27.00 (Recent Low/AR Support), $24.68 (Reaction Low Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on signs of weakness (down bar on high volume) or a low volume rally failing to exceed $29.06 (Secondary Test).
- **Invalidation:** $29.06
---
### CVS (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The price is in a BEARISH Quarterly Trend. The last weekly bar (Jan 26) shows extreme volume (RelVol 2.33) on a very wide down spread, closing near the middle (CLV -0.42). This is a strong indication of Supply Dominance, likely driven by a failed high volume rally (Jan 19, RelVol 0.92, CLV 0.90) leading to a massive liquidation event. The wide range down bar with heavy volume confirms Smart Money selling pressure. The close near the middle suggests some absorption (Selling Climax) but Supply Dominance is the stronger signal given the context.

**Key Levels:** $84.00 (Supply High), $70.69 (Selling Climax Low), $73.91 (Monthly Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on a low volume rally failing to sustain above $77.00 (ST), or break below $70.69.
- **Invalidation:** $84.00
---
### DUOL (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The price is in a BEARISH Quarterly Trend. The last weekly bar (Jan 26) shows high volume (RelVol 1.09) on an extremely wide spread, closing near the low (CLV -0.94). This is a continuation of Supply Dominance (confirmed in the monthly chart, RelVol 1.82, CLV -0.98). The high volume shows Smart Money is aggressively selling or liquidating positions, pushing the price lower rapidly. This pattern strongly suggests a deep markdown phase is in progress.

**Key Levels:** $155.89 (Recent Resistance), $133.50 (Recent Low/Demand), $147.70 (Prior Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on the break and close below $133.50 with strong volume confirmation.
- **Invalidation:** $155.89
---
### FFIN (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar (Jan 26) shows high volume (RelVol 1.80) on a medium spread, closing near the low (CLV -0.50). This confirms institutional supply emerging near the high ($33.66). The high volume down move, coming after the rally failed to clear prior high ground in the Jan 19 week, suggests Smart Money is distributing. The overall pattern suggests the recent uptrend might be ending, and distribution is occurring near $33-$34.

**Key Levels:** $33.66 (Supply High), $31.21 (Demand Support), $32.75 (Prior Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry upon failure of a low volume rally toward $33.66, or a break below $31.21.
- **Invalidation:** $33.66
---
### FFIV (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Confirmed Early)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly chart indicates confirmed early Stopping Volume. The last weekly bar (Jan 26) shows very high volume (RelVol 1.66) on an extremely wide spread, closing mid-range/low (CLV -0.34). The high volume occurred on a sharp reversal day, trading from $261.85 to $303.98 and closing at $275.61. This volatility, with the high volume, suggests Smart Money absorption of selling, particularly after the Jan 19 low volume weakness. The overall context suggests a potential turn in the Bearish Monthly Trend.

**Key Levels:** $303.98 (Supply/SC High), $261.85 (SC Low/Demand), $275.61 (Last Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry on a successful, low-volume Secondary Test below $270, or a clear break above $303.98.
- **Invalidation:** $261.85
---
### FHB (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar (Jan 26) shows extremely high volume (RelVol 1.96) on a wide spread, closing near the low (CLV -0.55). This strong downward momentum with high volume suggests heavy selling by Smart Money (Supply Dominance), likely marking the beginning of a reaction/distribution phase following the prior rally from $25.56. The volume is nearly double the average, indicating a significant shift in market character.

**Key Levels:** $28.11 (Supply High), $26.10 (Demand Low), $27.12 (Prior Open)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on a failure of a low volume rally towards $27.50, or break below $26.10 with volume confirmation.
- **Invalidation:** $28.11
---
### FIBK (BEARISH (Anticipating Reaction))
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly chart shows a confirmed early Buying Climax in January 2026. The last weekly bar (Jan 26) shows high volume (RelVol 1.00) on a wide spread, closing near the low (CLV -0.94). This wide down bar immediately following the Jan 19 week (high volume, wide range, poor close, CLV -0.49) confirms that supply has entered the market. The high volume selling suggests Smart Money distribution/liquidation. This is likely the Automatic Reaction (AR) following the climactic buying in early January.

**Key Levels:** $38.78 (Climax High/Supply), $35.38 (AR Low/Demand), $36.66 (Prior Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on failure of a rally back towards $37.50-$38.00 (ST) on low volume.
- **Invalidation:** $38.78
---
### FISV (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The price is in a BEARISH Quarterly Trend and confirmed Supply Dominance on the monthly chart (Jan RelVol 1.77, CLV -0.72). The last weekly bar (Jan 26) shows high volume (RelVol 0.95) on a wide down spread, closing mid-low (CLV -0.59). This confirms the continuous presence of institutional selling. The Jan 19 rally (CLV 0.95) was likely met by heavy selling, leading to the subsequent decline. Smart Money is distributing or aggressively selling down this price level.

**Key Levels:** $70.41 (Supply High), $62.67 (Recent Low/Demand), $67.91 (Recent Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on break below $62.67 on high volume, confirming markdown phase.
- **Invalidation:** $67.91
---
### GBCI (NEUTRAL/BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The price is in a BULLISH Quarterly Trend, but the monthly chart shows confirmed early Supply Dominance (Jan RelVol 1.37, CLV 0.90, but a wide range up bar closing off the highs after a major rally). The recent weekly bar (Jan 26) shows high volume (RelVol 1.36) on a wide spread, closing strong (CLV 0.79). While this looks bullish, the context of the monthly Supply Dominance detection (Jan high $51.06, closing at $50.68) suggests this strong close is likely an Upthrust After Distribution (UTAD) or final push before a major reversal. The volume spike confirms high activity at the highs.

**Key Levels:** $51.06 (Climax/UTAD High), $47.32 (Support), $48.00 (Prior Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on failure to break $51.06, confirmed by a sharp down bar on high volume (AR).
- **Invalidation:** $51.06
---
### GE (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The price is in a BULLISH Quarterly Trend. The Jan 19 weekly bar marked a clear Sign of Weakness (SOW): wide down bar, high volume (RelVol 1.96), closing near the low (CLV -0.77). This suggests strong Smart Money selling. The Jan 26 bar is a wide spread up bar on high volume (RelVol 1.64), closing near the high (CLV 0.90). This massive buying effort after the SOW is likely an Automatic Rally (AR) or a relief rally, not a resumption of the uptrend yet. The key is that the price is now below the highs ($332.79) with heavy trading activity, suggesting distribution.

**Key Levels:** $332.79 (Supply High), $290.07 (SOW Low/Demand), $307.60 (AR High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on a low-volume Secondary Test failure near $320-$325.
- **Invalidation:** $332.79
---
### GKOS (NEUTRAL/BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The price action since Jan 12 shows extreme volatility and high volume swings. The Jan 12 bar was a high volume (RelVol 1.25) wide spread up bar (CLV 0.89), suggesting a potential Buying Climax. The subsequent two weeks (Jan 19, 26) reacted poorly, showing wide spreads and closes in the lower half (CLV -0.71 and -0.54), despite decent volume (RelVol ~0.87-0.89). The failure to maintain the gains suggests distribution is active at these high levels, confirming the BC suspicion. The price is currently reacting from the climactic high.

**Key Levels:** $130.23 (Climax High/Supply), $116.63 (Recent Low/AR Support), $119.98 (Prior Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on a low-volume rally failing to clear $125 or a break below $116.63.
- **Invalidation:** $130.23
---
### GNTX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Confirmed Early)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly chart shows confirmed early Supply Dominance (Jan close $22.90, CLV -0.46). The last weekly bar (Jan 26) shows high volume (RelVol 1.25) on a medium spread down bar, closing near the low (CLV -0.24). This high-volume down move indicates Smart Money selling, confirming supply absorption in the prior up move (Jan 5). The low volume up bar following the down move (Jan 19) suggests demand weakness. The accumulation of high volume bars that do not lead to meaningful new highs confirms institutional selling/distribution.

**Key Levels:** $24.80 (Supply High), $22.31 (Recent Low/Demand), $23.59 (Prior Open)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on break below $22.31 on high volume.
- **Invalidation:** $24.80
---
### GWRE (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The price is in a BEARISH Quarterly Trend and the monthly chart shows extreme Supply Dominance (Jan RelVol 1.55, CLV -0.98). The last weekly bar (Jan 26) shows high volume (RelVol 1.45) on an extremely wide spread, closing near the low (CLV -0.95). This is an unambiguous Sign of Weakness (SOW) or a continuation of Supply Dominance, suggesting aggressive institutional liquidation. The high volume confirms the Smart Money flow is decisively bearish, pushing the price rapidly into markdown.

**Key Levels:** $163.46 (Recent Resistance), $140.25 (SOW Low/Demand), $160.32 (Prior Open)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on break below $140.25 on high volume.
- **Invalidation:** $163.46
---
### HDB (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The price is in a BEARISH Quarterly Trend. The Jan 5 week showed extreme volume (RelVol 2.88) on a wide down spread, closing near the low (CLV -0.90), a clear SOW/Supply Dominance. The subsequent weeks (Jan 12, 19, 26) attempted to rally or stabilize on lower volume (RelVol 1.28, 1.27, 1.45), but failed to generate strong upward momentum. The last week (Jan 26) shows high volume, narrow spread, closing mid-range (CLV 0.09), confirming accumulation/demand is currently weak against the backdrop of massive supply.

**Key Levels:** $35.80 (Recent Resistance), $32.04 (Demand Support), $32.97 (SOW Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on low volume rally failing to clear $34.00 (ST), or break below $32.04 on high volume.
- **Invalidation:** $35.80

### HPE (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Confirmed Strong)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly chart indicates confirmed STRONG Stopping Volume. The price has been in a steep decline (Bearish QT). The Jan 5 and Jan 12 weeks featured high volume selling, but the decline was halted. The last two weeks (Jan 19, 26) show price stabilizing on narrow spreads and low CLV values (0.04 and 0.01) despite decent volume. This suggests Smart Money accumulation is neutralizing supply. The price is currently sitting near the low of the range defined by the prior Selling Climax/Stopping Volume event ($21.76).

**Key Levels:** $24.41 (Prior Supply/Resistance), $21.02 (Demand Support/SC Low), $22.17 (Prior Down Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry on breakout above $22.01 on increased volume, aiming for $24.41.
- **Invalidation:** $21.02
---
### HPQ (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Confirmed Early)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The price is in a BEARISH Quarterly Trend and the monthly chart shows confirmed early Supply Dominance (Jan RelVol 1.84, CLV -0.72). The last weekly bar (Jan 26) shows high volume (RelVol 1.34) on a very narrow spread, closing mid-high (CLV 0.38). This suggests that the selling pressure has briefly subsided or met demand at $18.94. However, the overall sequence remains strongly bearish, marked by high volume down bars (Jan 5, Jan 12, Jan 19). The narrow range up close is likely a weak rally/Automatic Rally (AR) within the markdown phase.

**Key Levels:** $22.60 (Supply Resistance), $18.94 (SOW Low/Demand), $19.44 (Last Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on the break below $18.94 with volume confirmation.
- **Invalidation:** $20.28 (Recent High)
---
### HUM (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The price is in a BEARISH Quarterly Trend. The last weekly bar (Jan 26) shows extreme volume (RelVol 3.14) on an extremely wide down spread, closing near the low (CLV -0.90). This is a textbook Sign of Weakness/Supply Dominance event, confirming institutional liquidation. This massive bar broke all prior support levels dramatically. Smart Money is aggressively selling this asset.

**Key Levels:** $269.09 (Recent Resistance), $191.39 (SOW Low/Demand), $264.85 (Prior Open)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on the break below $191.39 with heavy volume, or on a low-volume Automatic Rally failure.
- **Invalidation:** $269.09
---
### IMAX (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Confirmed Early)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly chart indicates confirmed early Stopping Volume. The price action shows swings. The Jan 12 bar was high volume (RelVol 1.22) on a wide up spread, closing strong (CLV 0.90), suggesting demand. The Jan 19 reaction was a wide down bar, high volume (RelVol 0.75) closing low (CLV -0.82), indicating supply absorption. The last bar (Jan 26) is a narrow spread up bar on low volume (RelVol 0.62) closing mid-high (CLV 0.50). This suggests the immediate selling pressure is subsiding (Test after SOW). Given the Monthly SC confirmation, the weakness may be easing.

**Key Levels:** $37.86 (Supply/Resistance), $33.71 (SC Low/Demand), $34.91 (Last Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry above $35.30 with volume confirmation, or a low volume test near $34.00.
- **Invalidation:** $33.71
---
### INVH (BULLISH (Potential Accumulation))
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Confirmed Early)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly chart confirms early Stopping Volume. The Jan 5 week showed extreme volume (RelVol 2.56) on a wide down bar, closing mid-low (CLV -0.20), a potential Selling Climax. The subsequent rally (Jan 12, CLV 0.98) confirmed demand. The Jan 26 bar shows high volume (RelVol 1.26) on a medium spread down bar, closing near the middle (CLV -0.03). This is likely a shakeout or further accumulation activity within the bottoming process. The high volume suggests heavy exchange of hands, confirming Smart Money involvement.

**Key Levels:** $27.78 (Supply Resistance), $26.12 (SC Low/Demand), $26.73 (Last Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry above $27.39 (last week's high) with volume confirmation, or a successful Test of $26.12.
- **Invalidation:** $26.12
---
### IONQ (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The price is in a BEARISH Quarterly Trend. The Jan 5 and Jan 12 weeks saw high volume rallies, followed by the Jan 19 week showing high volume on a wide down bar closing low (CLV -0.63), signaling supply. The last weekly bar (Jan 26) shows high volume (RelVol 1.02) on an extremely wide spread, closing near the low (CLV -0.81). This confirms Supply Dominance and the rejection of the earlier rally attempts. The overall structure suggests distribution is active and the price is moving into a markdown phase.

**Key Levels:** $54.24 (Climax High/Supply), $38.92 (SOW Low/Demand), $50.59 (Prior High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on break below $38.92 on volume confirmation.
- **Invalidation:** $50.59
---
### IONX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The price is in a BEARISH Quarterly Trend. The last weekly bar (Jan 26) shows extreme volume (RelVol 2.03) on an extremely wide spread, closing near the low (CLV -0.83). This is a dramatic Sign of Weakness/Supply Dominance bar. Institutional selling is aggressive, dumping shares into the market and marking a clear markdown continuation from the prior rally attempts (Jan 5/12). The extreme volume confirms the severity of the institutional selling.

**Key Levels:** $26.30 (Recent Resistance), $15.21 (SOW Low/Demand), $23.91 (Prior Open)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on break below $15.21 with volume confirmation.
- **Invalidation:** $26.30
---
### IREN (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The price is in a BULLISH Quarterly Trend but shows significant short-term weakness. The Jan 12 bar was a high volume (RelVol 1.19) wide up bar, closing strong (CLV 0.85), suggesting climactic buying. The subsequent Jan 19 bar showed high volume (RelVol 1.02) but closed significantly off the high (CLV 0.61). The last weekly bar (Jan 26) confirms the climax: extremely high volume (RelVol 1.22) on a wide down spread, closing mid-low (CLV -0.66). This is a clear Supply Dominance bar indicating distribution/liquidation following the blow-off top near $63.59.

**Key Levels:** $63.59 (Climax High/Supply), $51.78 (SOW Low/Demand), $56.68 (Prior Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry upon failure of a low volume rally towards $58.00 (ST), or break below $51.78.
- **Invalidation:** $63.59
---
### JPM (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The price is in a BEARISH Quarterly Trend. The Jan 12 and Jan 19 weeks featured high volume and wide down bars closing low (CLV -0.38, -0.83), signaling strong institutional selling (Supply Dominance/SOW). The last weekly bar (Jan 26) shows high volume (RelVol 1.24) on a wide spread, closing strong (CLV 0.61). This high volume up bar is likely the Automatic Rally (AR) following the intense selling. It successfully closed the week above the midpoint, but it failed to recover significant ground, confirming the prior weakness.

**Key Levels:** $326.86 (Prior Supply), $297.45 (SOW Low/Demand), $307.93 (AR High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on failure of a low volume rally back towards $315-$320 (ST) or break below $297.45.
- **Invalidation:** $326.86
---
### KVYO (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly chart confirms early Supply Dominance/Selling Climax (Jan CLV -0.96). The Jan 5 week showed high volume selling (RelVol 1.84) followed by the Jan 12 week being an extremely wide down bar, closing near the low (CLV -0.96), marking a clear Selling Climax. The Jan 19 bar was a high volume up bar (RelVol 0.84), closing mid-high (CLV 0.40), indicating initial demand reaction. The Jan 26 bar, however, shows high volume (RelVol 1.00) on a wide spread, closing near the low (CLV -0.91), signaling a shakeout or a final strong test of the SC low. This volatility suggests the bottoming process is complex but the low is likely holding.

**Key Levels:** $26.73 (Supply Resistance), $22.03 (Selling Climax Low/Demand), $23.00 (Prior Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry on a successful, low-volume Secondary Test near $22.03, confirmed by a strong up bar.
- **Invalidation:** $22.03
---
### LHX (BEARISH (Anticipating Reaction))
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The price is in a BULLISH Quarterly Trend but shows significant recent weakness. The Jan 12 bar was extremely high volume (RelVol 2.09) on a wide spread, closing mid-range (CLV -0.05), suggesting a potential Buying Climax/Upthrust. The Jan 26 bar confirms this weakness: high volume (RelVol 1.39) on a wide down spread, closing near the low (CLV -0.78). This is a strong Sign of Weakness/Automatic Reaction (AR). Smart Money distributed into the strength, and the price is now moving lower.

**Key Levels:** $369.59 (Climax High/Supply), $339.61 (AR Low/Demand), $342.85 (Last Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on failure of a low volume rally (ST) towards $355, or break below $339.61.
- **Invalidation:** $369.59
---
### MSFU (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The price is in a BEARISH Quarterly Trend and the monthly chart confirms Supply Dominance. The last weekly bar (Jan 26) shows extreme volume (RelVol 5.78) on an extremely wide down spread, closing near the low (CLV -0.68). This is a massive SOW, breaking key support levels with intense institutional selling. While the volume surge could signal a Selling Climax, the high CLV suggests the selling was sustained and price closed deeply into the range. Continuation of the markdown is highly likely.

**Key Levels:** $40.96 (Supply Resistance), $30.43 (SOW Low/Demand), $38.01 (Prior Open)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on break below $30.43 with high volume.
- **Invalidation:** $40.96
---
### NET (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The price is in a BEARISH Quarterly Trend. The last weekly bar (Jan 26) shows extreme volume (RelVol 2.78) on an extremely wide down spread, closing near the low (CLV -0.89). This is a devastating Sign of Weakness/Automatic Reaction, likely confirming the end of the prior weak rally. The high volume surge confirms aggressive institutional selling/liquidation. This massive volume bar suggests Smart Money distribution has concluded and markdown is accelerating.

**Key Levels:** $218.22 (Climax High/Supply), $175.07 (SOW Low/Demand), $184.90 (Prior Open)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on break below $175.07 with volume confirmation.
- **Invalidation:** $218.22
---
### NICE (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Confirmed Early)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly chart indicates confirmed early Supply Dominance. The last weekly bar (Jan 26) shows low volume (RelVol 0.93) on a very wide down spread, closing near the low (CLV -0.92). This is a Sign of Weakness (SOW) confirmed on below-average volume. The prior rally from Jan 19 (CLV 0.54) was weak and failed dramatically. The wide spread down on even moderate volume suggests supply is easily overwhelming demand, confirming the bearish monthly context.

**Key Levels:** $117.21 (Supply Resistance), $106.00 (SOW Low/Demand), $115.11 (Prior Open)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on break below $106.00 on volume confirmation.
- **Invalidation:** $117.21
---
### OC (NEUTRAL/BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Confirmed Early)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly chart indicates confirmed early Stopping Volume. The last weekly bar (Jan 26) shows high volume (RelVol 1.15) on a wide down spread, closing mid-range/low (CLV -0.29). This bar follows strong buying pressure in the prior weeks (Jan 5/12/19). The current down move is likely an Automatic Reaction (AR) or Shakeout, testing the prior demand. The high volume suggests heavy exchange of hands, often associated with absorption/accumulation in this phase, especially given the bullish Quarterly Trend.

**Key Levels:** $126.92 (Climax High/Supply), $116.88 (AR Low/Demand), $125.24 (Prior Open)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry on successful, low-volume Secondary Test above $118.00, or a break above $126.92.
- **Invalidation:** $116.88
---
### OTIS (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The price is in a BEARISH Quarterly Trend. The last weekly bar (Jan 26) shows extreme volume (RelVol 2.10) on a very wide down spread, closing near the low (CLV -0.62). This is a strong Sign of Weakness (SOW)/Supply Dominance bar, confirming institutional liquidation. This selling follows the failed high-volume rally in the Jan 19 week (CLV 0.97). The high volume suggests Smart Money is aggressively selling/distributing at these levels.

**Key Levels:** $91.65 (Supply High), $84.00 (SOW Low/Demand), $85.42 (Last Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on break below $84.00 with high volume confirmation.
- **Invalidation:** $91.65
---
### OZK (NEUTRAL/BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The price is in a BULLISH Quarterly Trend. The Jan 19 weekly bar showed extreme volume (RelVol 2.05) on a wide down spread, closing near the low (CLV -0.91), a major SOW. The next week (Jan 26) rallied back sharply on lower volume (RelVol 1.13) on a medium spread, closing strong (CLV 0.69). This rapid bounce back suggests the Jan 19 move was a Selling Climax/Shakeout and Smart Money is now supporting the price. We are looking for confirmation that the shakeout low ($45.77) will hold.

**Key Levels:** $49.69 (Supply Resistance), $45.77 (SC Low/Demand), $47.56 (Last Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry above $47.90 with volume confirmation, or a low-volume retest of $46.00.
- **Invalidation:** $45.77
---
### PB (NEUTRAL/BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Jan 19 weekly bar was a wide up bar on below-average volume (RelVol 0.65) closing low (CLV -0.86), suggesting a strong Upthrust. The next bar (Jan 26) shows extreme volume (RelVol 2.38) on a very wide down spread, closing mid-low (CLV -0.04). This is a strong shakeout/Selling Climax event. The volume surge suggests Smart Money absorption, particularly at the low of $65.12. Given the bullish Quarterly Trend, this is likely a powerful spring or shakeout before the next leg up.

**Key Levels:** $73.26 (Supply Resistance), $65.12 (SC Low/Demand), $69.01 (Last Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry on a successful, low-volume Secondary Test of $65.12, or a clear break above $73.26.
- **Invalidation:** $65.12
---
### PTGX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result / Weakness confirmed

**Smart Money Logic:**
Monthly sequence is BUYING_CLIMAX (CONFIRMED_EARLY) within a BEARISH Quarterly Trend. Despite a close off the weekly low (CLV 0.24), the high volume (0.77 RelVol) wide spread down bar (6.62 points) indicates effort (volume) without a strong bullish result (close well off the high). This confirms that selling is dominating after the prior buying climax/thrust.

**Key Levels:** $87.44 (Recent High), $77.69 (Immediate Support), $79.87 (Pivot)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $77.69 (Weekly Low)
- **Invalidation:** $84.32 (High of last supply bar)
---
### RF (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Demand Confirmation / Up Bar

**Smart Money Logic:**
Despite the Monthly SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (CONFIRMED_EARLY) context, the last weekly bar showed a strong reaction. It was an up bar with a decent spread (1.42 points) closing near the high (CLV 0.76) on average volume (0.81 RelVol). This suggests demand returned at the $27.25 level, successfully absorbing prior supply and pushing the price higher. This demand confirms short-term strength within the consolidation range.

**Key Levels:** $29.26 (Recent High), $27.25 (Test/Support Level), $28.52 (Pivot)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and hold above $28.67 (Last Bar High)
- **Invalidation:** $27.25 (Demand Support Low)
---
### RVMD (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Distribution/Supply Entry

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the Monthly sequence is BUYING_CLIMAX (CONFIRMED_EARLY) following a massive volume spike two weeks ago. The last weekly bar was a wide spread down (9.43 points), closing near the low (CLV -0.56) on very high volume (1.49 RelVol). This is strong evidence of distribution and supply entry after the climactic run. The previous weeks' high volume bars ($121.61, $124.49) failed to hold the gains, indicating sellers dominated the recent peak.

**Key Levels:** $124.49 (Climax High), $92.50 (Support), $96.95 (Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $92.50 (Weekly Low)
- **Invalidation:** $101.93 (High of Supply Bar)
---
### SATS (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Distribution / Supply Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the Monthly sequence is BUYING_CLIMAX (CONFIRMED_EARLY). The last weekly bar was an extreme wide spread down bar (22.37 points) closing near the low (CLV -0.67) on high volume (1.78 RelVol). This heavy supply entering the market validates the Buying Climax status, indicating that Smart Money is distributing heavily at these high levels. The massive down move confirms the break of demand.

**Key Levels:** $132.25 (Climax High), $109.57 (Supply Low), $113.22 (Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $109.57 with volume
- **Invalidation:** $126.00 (Last Supply Open)
---
### SONY (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance Continuation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH, and the weekly sequence confirms SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The last weekly bar was a wide spread down (1.33 points) closing near the low (CLV -0.55) on extremely high volume (1.83 RelVol). This persistent high volume downside action confirms strong selling pressure and liquidation by Smart Money, continuing the bearish trend from the prior two weeks.

**Key Levels:** $23.13 (Immediate Resistance), $21.80 (Weekly Low), $23.55 (Prior Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $21.80 (Weekly Low)
- **Invalidation:** $23.13 (High of Supply Bar)
---
### SPOT (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Confirmation / High Volume Down Bar

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH, and the weekly sequence is SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The last weekly bar was a wide spread down (26.69 points) closing near the middle/low (CLV -0.47) on high volume (1.01 RelVol). This action confirms persistent institutional selling (supply) following the two prior weeks of climactic selling ($609 to $491). The lack of bullish reaction on this volume confirms weakness.

**Key Levels:** $520.00 (Recent Supply High), $493.31 (Immediate Support), $504.50 (Prior Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $493.31 with confirmation
- **Invalidation:** $520.00 (High of Supply Bar)
---
### TFX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance Continuation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH, and the weekly sequence is SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The last weekly bar was a wide spread down (4.03 points), closing mid-range (CLV -0.29) on high volume (1.66 RelVol). The volume is increasing while the price continues to drop from the highs, indicating persistent institutional liquidation. The short-term demand seen last week ($100.18 to $107.06) has been quickly nullified by renewed supply.

**Key Levels:** $106.98 (Resistance), $102.95 (Immediate Support), $100.18 (Major Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $102.95 with volume
- **Invalidation:** $106.98 (Supply High)
---
### VONG (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Confirmation / High Volume Down Bar

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH, though the Monthly suggests STOPPING_VOLUME (CONFIRMED_EARLY). The last weekly bar was a wide spread down (3.84 points) closing below the mid-point (CLV -0.28) on high volume (1.28 RelVol). This action confirms supply entry, nullifying the prior week's small bullish reaction (CLV 0.70). Supply is dominant in the short term, driving the price lower.

**Key Levels:** $122.50 (Resistance), $118.66 (Support), $120.03 (Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $118.66 with conviction
- **Invalidation:** $122.50 (Supply High)
