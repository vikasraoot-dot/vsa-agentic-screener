- **Invalidation:** 26.80
---
### PGY (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
Massive supply entered on 2026-02-09 with RelVol 2.6. The current low volume (RelVol 0.46) on 2026-02-16 indicates a lack of professional buying rather than a reversal. Professional money is not supporting the price.

### PHG (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**

- **Entry Trigger:** Failure to hold 30.80
- **Invalidation:** 33.44
---
### PLTR (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Significant distribution occurred on 2026-02-02 (RelVol 1.96). The subsequent bounce is occurring on declining volume (RelVol 0.65), signifying a 'dead cat bounce' without smart money sponsorship.

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 127.29
- **Invalidation:** 140.96
---
### PLTU (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
A major expansion of spread to the downside on 2026-02-02 with RelVol 2.83 indicates aggressive professional selling. The recent rally is a low-volume retracement (RelVol 0.65) into the breakdown zone.

**Key Levels:** 34.74, 43.12, 47.85

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Weakness at 43.12
- **Invalidation:** 46.62

### PRU (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply

### PSN (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
Massive supply expansion on 2026-02-09 followed by a high-CLV close (0.95) last week on lower volume. This suggests the high-volume flush might be being absorbed, but trend remains quarterly bearish.

- **Invalidation:** 61.33
---
### PTGX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
Volume is completely drying up on a quarterly bearish trend. Professional money is absent. The high CLV last week on very low volume (RelVol 0.24) indicates a lack of selling pressure, but also zero buying interest.

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 80.39
- **Invalidation:** 83.39

- **Invalidation:** 52.68
---
### QTWO (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
RelVol 2.10 on a down move on 2026-02-09 shows professional urgency to sell. Last week's low CLV (-0.82) on very low volume suggests that the path of least resistance is firmly down.

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 51.34
- **Invalidation:** 54.27
---
### RF (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result

**Smart Money Logic:**
A high-volume rally on 2026-02-02 failed to sustain momentum. Professional selling expanded on 2026-02-09, and the current low volume suggests a lack of buying interest at current levels.

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 29.30
- **Invalidation:** 30.30

### RGTI (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** No Supply

- **Invalidation:** 18.89

### RLI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
Monthly supply dominance is overriding the weekly trend. Last week's volume was low, and price closed in the bottom half of the bar (CLV -0.49), suggesting professionals are feeding stock into the market.

### RYAAY (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stopping volume on 2026-01-26 failed to produce a rally. Last week's low volume and very low CLV (-0.82) suggest professional money has abandoned the defense of current levels.

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 63.83
- **Invalidation:** 67.42
---
### RYN (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result

**Smart Money Logic:**
Massive volume on 2026-01-26 (RelVol 3.7) failed to sustain price. Last week's high volume drop with extremely low CLV (-0.95) shows aggressive professional selling into support.

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 22.32
- **Invalidation:** 23.60
---
### SATS (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
The high volume expansion on 2026-01-26 led to a major reversal. Professional distribution is complete. Current low volume recovery is a lure for retail before the next drop.

**Key Levels:** 106.60, 114.84, 131.94

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 110.25
- **Invalidation:** 117.23
---
### SONY (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Price remains in a supply dominant channel. Last week's low CLV (-0.54) on declining volume suggests professionals are not defending the 22.00 level.

**Smart Money Logic:**
High volume on 2026-02-02 (RelVol 2.8) and 2026-02-09 (RelVol 2.1) without any significant price recovery. Last week's weak volume and low CLV show professionals are liquidating.

### STM (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
Massive buying spike on 2026-02-09 resulted in a middle close (CLV 0.06). Professional distribution is suspected. Last week's price drop on low volume suggests a test of the climax high is pending.

- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 32.14
- **Invalidation:** 34.32
---
### SYF (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Consistent RelVol above 1.5 on down moves confirms professional selling dominance. Last week's low-volume bounce into a low CLV (0.20) suggests the move is exhausted and likely to roll over.

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 70.54
- **Invalidation:** 73.39

### TROW (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Major professional selling on 2026-02-02 (RelVol 2.1). The bounce last week was on very weak volume (RelVol 0.58), signifying a total lack of interest from the smart money at these levels.

- **Invalidation:** 95.64

### TXT (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Large professional volume entered on 2026-01-26. However, professionals absorbed that selling on 2026-02-02. Current low volume and low CLV suggest a consolidation phase.

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 101.60
- **Invalidation:** 97.75
---
### UBER (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
A continuous expansion of supply since early February. Last week's small bounce on low volume (RelVol 0.59) indicates a lack of buyers rather than a bottoming process.

### UGI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
Professional selling was clear on 2026-02-02 (RelVol 1.2, CLV -1.0). Last week's drop in volume with low CLV suggests professional money is continuing to exit the stock.

- **Invalidation:** 39.00

### UNH (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
RelVol 2.97 during the late January drop confirms massive distribution. Current low volume recovery (RelVol 0.40) is not being supported by professionals. Liquidation into strength is occurring.

### VLTO (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Large supply entered on 2026-02-02 (RelVol 2.22). Last week's rally on low volume (RelVol 0.78) with moderate CLV indicates a lack of conviction from the bulls.

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 91.61
- **Invalidation:** 95.45

### VNO (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 42.00
- **Invalidation:** 40.26

### VONG (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
Monthly stopping volume confirmed early, but weekly RelVol is dropping on the downside. Lack of aggressive professional buying suggests price will continue to drift lower.

- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 113.96
- **Invalidation:** 117.04
---
### WGMI (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
A high-volume flush on 2026-02-02 was met with a high CLV (0.51) test last week. Smart money is watching the 34-38 level for a potential accumulation entry.

**Key Levels:** 34.99, 40.69, 46.62

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 41.50
- **Invalidation:** 38.38
---
### WHR (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stopping volume from early February was not supported. Last week's very low CLV (-0.84) and volume suggest that the support level is failing as professionals refuse to buy.

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 85.22
- **Invalidation:** 89.34

- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 30.00
- **Invalidation:** 28.13

- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 69.90
- **Invalidation:** 72.06
---
### XYL (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Massive supply expansion on 2026-02-09 (RelVol 2.4). Last week's bounce on low volume suggests a lack of smart money demand. Sellers are likely to return at higher levels.

- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 127.10
- **Invalidation:** 130.47
