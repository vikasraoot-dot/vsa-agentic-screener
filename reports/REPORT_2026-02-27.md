## 👀 Watch/Monitoring
### ABVX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Price rejected the 132.91 level with a wide spread down on moderate volume. The low CLV (-0.64) suggests sellers are in control and the prior monthly supply dominance is asserting itself.

**Key Levels:** 132.92, 116.54, 107.41

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 116.50
- **Invalidation:** 133.50
---
### ACLX (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result

**Smart Money Logic:**
Massive relative volume (9.45x) on an extremely narrow spread at the highs. This indicates heavy supply is being met by heavy demand, often signaling a local top or an absorption phase before a pause.

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** High volume breakout above 115.00 or retracement to 71.00

---
### ACN (BULLISH)

- **Invalidation:** 72.30
---
### ADP (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Major selling pressure at 250-260 levels. The recent bounce to 218 is on lower comparative volume, suggesting a corrective move rather than a true reversal.

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Rejection at 225-230
- **Invalidation:** 232.00
---
### AEHR (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Volume surge accompanying a break above 14.50
- **Invalidation:** 12.00
---
### AFRM (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Despite a high CLV (0.80) on the last bar, the preceding weeks show massive distribution. The rally is a low-volume reaction to a heavy sell-off.

- **Invalidation:** 31.10
---
### AKAM (BEARISH)

- **Invalidation:** 105.00

- **Invalidation:** 14.00

- **Invalidation:** 176.00

### BBWI (BEARISH)

- **Invalidation:** 25.00
---
### BE (NEUTRAL)

- **Invalidation:** 130.00

- **Invalidation:** 33.00
---
### BHP (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

- **Invalidation:** 12.00
---
### BKSY (BEARISH)

- **Entry Trigger:** Break of 18.70 support
- **Invalidation:** 22.00
---
### BL (BEARISH)

- **Entry Trigger:** Failure to hold 36.00
- **Invalidation:** 39.00
---
### BRBR (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
High volume on the drop to 17.09 suggests professional absorption. The recent tightening of spread and lower volume indicates selling pressure is exhausting, but a 'Test' of the lows is needed.

**Key Levels:** 19.69, 17.09

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Low volume test of 17.50
- **Invalidation:** 17.00
---
### BROS (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result

**Smart Money Logic:**
High volume is being churned at these levels. While the last week closed strong (CLV 0.92), the massive volume 2 weeks prior resulted in a heavy drop. This indicates heavy supply is still present near 57-60.

**Key Levels:** 59.83, 46.52

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Clean break above 60.00 with volume
- **Invalidation:** 48.00

- **Invalidation:** 38.00
---
### BWA (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
A 2.8x volume spike into a wide spread produced a very poor close (CLV 0.19) three weeks ago. This is a classic 'Buying Climax' where smart money sells to late retail. The trend has since stalled.

**Key Levels:** 70.08, 52.02

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 57.50
- **Invalidation:** 63.00
---
### BX (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
Professional money is clearly entering on the lows. Massive volume (2.0x rel vol monthly) is producing a narrowing of the spread. Last week's CLV of 0.40 suggests absorption is nearing completion.

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Low volume test of 115.00
- **Invalidation:** 110.00

- **Invalidation:** 45.00
---
### CALX (BEARISH)

- **Invalidation:** 55.00

### CDNS (BULLISH)

### DOCU (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Demand / Distribution

**Smart Money Logic:**
The breakdown on high relative volume was not recovered with comparable volume. The smart money remains bearish as price action shows wide spreads on down moves and narrow on up moves.

**Key Levels:** 53.28, 40.16

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Failure at 46.00
- **Invalidation:** 49.50
---
### DUOL (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
A massive markdown on 2.0x rel vol. Institutional investors have exited. The small bounce last week on high volume but average spread suggests high supply churning.

**Key Levels:** 136.54, 104.51

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Rejection of 120.00
- **Invalidation:** 130.00
---
### ENR (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Price is falling on widening spreads. CLV is consistently low, indicating professional sellers are in control. Relative volume on the monthly breakdown is high.

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break of 21.30
- **Invalidation:** 23.50
---
### EPAM (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

Devastating markdown on high relative volume. Institutional liquidation is nearly complete but no professional buying is present yet. Stay away from the falling knife.

**Key Levels:** 214.43, 125.57

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** N/A - No bottoming sign
- **Invalidation:** 150.00
---
### ETHA (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
Massive volume at the 13.62 low was met with professional absorption. The narrowing of spread and high CLV (0.56) suggests a base is forming.

**Key Levels:** 18.11, 13.62

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 16.00
- **Invalidation:** 13.50
---
### EXPE (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Smart money exited heavily on 2.0x relative volume in early Feb. Last week's high volume rally looks like short covering, as the monthly context remains extremely bearish with high supply dominance.

**Key Levels:** 280.51, 185.34

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Rejection of 220.00 level
- **Invalidation:** 237.00
---
### FFIV (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
Professional money absorbed supply in Jan/Feb. Relative volume has dropped significantly while price holds, confirming a successful test of overhead supply. Professional intent is long.

**Key Levels:** 303.98, 259.67

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 285.00
- **Invalidation:** 265.00
---
### FHB (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Weekly spread remains wide with closes consistently in the lower half of the range. Recent volume is diminishing on the attempted price stabilization, suggesting a lack of demand rather than an absorption of supply.

**Key Levels:** 24.74 (Support), 27.83 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 24.70
- **Invalidation:** 26.50
---
### FIBK (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
After a monthly buying climax, the weekly action has turned choppy. Low relative volume on the last two weeks (0.55-0.58) indicates that smart money is not supporting the current price level, waiting for a deeper test.

**Key Levels:** 35.30 (Support), 38.78 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** High volume test of 35.30
- **Invalidation:** 39.26
---
### FISV (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Test in a Downtrend

**Smart Money Logic:**
Monthly supply dominance is present, but the weekly volume is drying up (RelVol 0.60) as price approaches the 58 level. This is a potential test, but needs a confirmational bullish bar.

**Key Levels:** 57.79 (Support), 64.40 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Bullish engulfing bar on high volume
- **Invalidation:** 57.50
---
### GBCI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Price is falling with low CLV and closes near the lows of the week. RelVol is low, suggesting a lack of institutional interest to support the stock during this retracement.

**Key Levels:** 47.31 (Support), 54.00 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short on break of 47.31
- **Invalidation:** 51.30
---
### GNTX (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
Price is drifting sideways on very low relative volume (0.47). Neither side is aggressive. VSA principle of 'No Demand' suggests price will likely drift lower to find support.

**Key Levels:** 22.20 (Support), 25.14 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for 22.20 test
- **Invalidation:** 24.20
---
### HIMS (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Panic Selling

**Smart Money Logic:**
Sustained high volume on down moves with extremely low CLV. While the last week saw some narrowing of spread, the Relative Volume remains high (1.50) without a significant price recovery, suggesting supply is still dominating.

**Key Levels:** 13.74 (Support), 19.52 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for 'Stopping Volume' signal
- **Invalidation:** 16.50
---
### HPE (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Confirmed)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Price is testing the Feb 23 lows on very low volume. This is generally bullish, but the bearish quarterly context requires a high-volume confirmation bar to initiate a long position.

**Key Levels:** 19.84 (Support), 24.38 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Bullish reversal bar > 21.40
- **Invalidation:** 19.80
---
### ING (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
Despite a high CLV bar on Feb 16, the follow-through was weak with low CLV (0.20) and declining volume. Supply is likely still present above 30.00.

**Key Levels:** 28.00 (Support), 31.18 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** High volume break of 31.20
- **Invalidation:** 28.60
---
### IREN (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Churning

**Smart Money Logic:**
While volume is high, price is failing to make significant headway and CLV remains mediocre (0.27). This suggests a lot of 'effort but no result,' which is bearish in this context.

**Key Levels:** 36.52 (Support), 55.72 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for 36.52 test
- **Invalidation:** 47.25
---
### ITT (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Overbought / No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
Price is at highs but the last bar shows negative CLV (-0.12) on much lower volume. This suggests the move is running out of steam.

**Key Levels:** 181.32 (Support), 209.31 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Look for short on break of 199.90
- **Invalidation:** 209.50
---
### KDP (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
The price rise is occurring on declining relative volume. The latest bar shows high spread but negative CLV, indicating sellers are moving in at these higher prices.

**Key Levels:** 27.20 (Support), 31.50 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short on break of 29.40
- **Invalidation:** 30.50
---
### KKR (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Persistent selling with RelVol increasing on down bars (1.82). Low CLV suggests no significant professional support yet.

**Key Levels:** 91.00 (Support), 116.08 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short on break of 91.00
- **Invalidation:** 99.90
---
### KLAR (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax

Massive volume on the drop (RelVol 4.94) followed by a weak bounce with negative CLV. Supply is still overwhelmingly in control.

**Key Levels:** 12.50 (Support), 20.10 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for stabilization
- **Invalidation:** 16.40
---
### LNC (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
High volume on a down-bar that closed near the low. The attempt at stopping volume has failed as supply continues to pressure the stock.

**Key Levels:** 34.61 (Support), 43.06 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short below 34.60
- **Invalidation:** 39.57
---
### LSCC (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Churning

**Smart Money Logic:**

- **Entry Trigger:** Break of 108.08 with high volume
- **Invalidation:** 95.80
---
### LTM (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**

**Key Levels:** 56.32 (Support), 67.44 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short on break of 56.30
- **Invalidation:** 59.34
---
### MAN (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Price rejected the 37 level with high volume and continues to close near lows. RelVol of 1.46 on the latest down move confirms selling pressure.

**Key Levels:** 25.15 (Support), 37.59 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short on break of 27.60
- **Invalidation:** 30.38
---
### MAT (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Extreme supply signature on Feb 9 (RelVol 4.07). The subsequent recovery has been on low volume and failing CLV, characteristic of a 'Dead Cat Bounce.'

**Key Levels:** 14.75 (Support), 22.48 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short below 16.68
- **Invalidation:** 18.24
---
### MNDY (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Churning

**Smart Money Logic:**
Volume remains very high (RelVol 3.61 on monthly) while price is stagnating. This is a battleground between smart money buying and residual supply. Needs to clear 80.00.

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 80.90
- **Invalidation:** 71.33
---
### MSFU (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Abnormally high volume (RelVol 5.7) on the initial drop. Although price is stabilizing, the 'Effort vs Result' is not yet bullish enough to warrant an entry.

**Key Levels:** 24.98 (Support), 40.96 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for test of 24.98
- **Invalidation:** 28.41
---
### OC (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

- **Invalidation:** 133.50
---

- **Invalidation:** 25.40
---
### PGY (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Extreme volume on down moves in early February confirms heavy distribution. While the latest week shows some short-covering (CLV 0.88), the overall trend and lack of professional demand keep the bias lower.

**Key Levels:** 10.51, 12.73, 16.54

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Failure to hold 11.80
- **Invalidation:** 13.66
---
### PLTR (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Test of Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
Heavy distribution occurred at the start of February. Current price action shows a 'Shakeout' behavior where the low of 126.23 is being defended. Volume is drying up, suggesting a potential bottom is forming.

**Key Levels:** 126.23, 137.51, 145.87

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close above 137.50 on rising volume
- **Invalidation:** 126.23
---
### PLTU (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
Massive supply entered during the 36-40 range in early Feb. Recent low-volume testing with high CLV (0.70) indicates the selling has stopped, but a significant catalyst is needed to reverse the bearish trend.

**Key Levels:** 34.66, 43.12, 51.62

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** High volume reversal above 41.00
- **Invalidation:** 34.66
---
### PRU (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 100.35
- **Invalidation:** 104.00
---
### PTGX (BULLISH)

**Key Levels:** 77.00, 89.59, 96.54

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close above 90.00
- **Invalidation:** 81.50

**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Overextended

- **Entry Trigger:** None - Avoiding at highs
- **Invalidation:** 51.22

- **Invalidation:** 51.34
---
### RF (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
The rally in early Feb failed to attract volume (RelVol 0.65). The current price action is weak with a low CLV (-0.33) on the monthly chart, suggesting professional players are sitting out.

**Key Levels:** 28.28, 31.53, 29.30

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Volume spike above 30.50
- **Invalidation:** 28.28
---
### RGTI (BULLISH)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 19.21
- **Invalidation:** 16.00
---
### RKT (BEARISH)

- **Entry Trigger:** Short below 16.58
- **Invalidation:** 18.57
---
### RLI (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Neutral/Consolidation

**Smart Money Logic:**
Volume is very low (RelVol 0.69) suggesting a lack of interest from big money. The price is drifting without a clear VSA signal of strength or weakness.

**Key Levels:** 58.15, 63.61, 55.80

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break of 63.61 with RelVol > 1.5
- **Invalidation:** 59.88
---
### RTO (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax Confirming

- **Invalidation:** 30.55
---
### RYN (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short on break of 20.75
- **Invalidation:** 22.60
---
### SATS (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Weakness / Up-Thrust

**Smart Money Logic:**
A Buying Climax in January was followed by an 'Up-Thrust' and falling prices on high volume. Professional distribution is the primary driver here.

**Key Levels:** 104.63, 122.99, 132.25

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short below 104.60
- **Invalidation:** 113.15
---
### STM (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Potential Topping

**Smart Money Logic:**
A massive volume spike on Feb 9 (RelVol 2.16) resulted in a low CLV (0.06), signaling supply entering. While the price is grinding higher, it lacks conviction from professional demand.

**Key Levels:** 31.96, 35.07, 27.27

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Breakout above 35.10
- **Invalidation:** 33.45
---
### TXT (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Despite the rally, volume is significantly declining (RelVol 0.61). This 'No Demand' rally is likely to fail as it approaches overhead supply at 100-101.

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short below 97.75
- **Invalidation:** 101.57
---
### UBER (BEARISH)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short below 69.00
- **Invalidation:** 74.77
---
### UGI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Weakness / No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
Selling pressure was high in early Feb and demand has not returned. The low CLV on both monthly (-0.69) and current weekly (-0.25) charts suggests further downside.

**Key Levels:** 36.57, 41.34, 38.97

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short below 36.77
- **Invalidation:** 38.52
---
### UNH (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
A massive distribution bar on Jan 26 (RelVol 2.97) has set a bearish tone. Rallies are weak and failing to penetrate the mid-point of that supply bar.

- **Entry Trigger:** Short below 271.80
- **Invalidation:** 294.23

- **Invalidation:** 29.92

- **Invalidation:** 41.42

---
### WHR (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Capitulation-like volume (RelVol 3.46) but with a very poor close (CLV -0.84). This indicates heavy distribution and 'Bag Holding' by the public. Professionals are still selling.

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short below 67.80
- **Invalidation:** 83.48

- **Invalidation:** 26.75
