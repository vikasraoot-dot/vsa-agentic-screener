## 🚀 Ready for Entry
### ABVX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Effort No Result

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence is marked as a confirmed early Buying Climax. The previous high volume weeks (RelVol 1.73, 1.93) showed weak upward progress. The most recent bar is a wide down bar (Spread 14.01) closing on the low (CLV -0.97) on average volume (RelVol 0.64), confirming strong weakness following the previous high volume struggle. This suggests distribution.

**Key Levels:** 125.00 (Recent high resistance), 108.95 (Major support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below the recent low of 108.95 or a weak rally (LRS) testing 121-125.
- **Invalidation:** 125.00 (High of recent supply bar)
---
### ACN (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result / Weakness confirmed

**Smart Money Logic:**
The market is showing effort (high volume, RelVol 0.99) but the result is a wide down bar, closing near the low (CLV -0.53). This happens after a series of high volume bars where upward momentum stalled (Jan 5 & Jan 12). The monthly context confirms Stopping Volume attempts, but the latest weekly bar suggests Smart Money selling is overwhelming buying efforts at the highs (near 285).

**Key Levels:** 291.09 (Monthly high resistance), 257.37 (Recent support/Monthly low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 257.37.
- **Invalidation:** 284.59 (High of the down bar)
---
### ACWX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly chart shows a Buying Climax status. Volume has been consistently very high (RelVol 2.0 to 2.3), yet the spread is narrowing (0.99 -> 0.83 -> 1.70 -> 1.83). The last bar is a wide spread bar on high volume, but it closes near the low (CLV -0.69). This suggests massive selling into strength (Distribution). Upward progress is failing despite exceptional volume.

**Key Levels:** 72.33 (High of Climax), 70.50 (Immediate support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below 70.50, targeting continuation of weakness.
- **Invalidation:** 72.33 (High of the climax bar)
---
### AEVA (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Confirmed Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stock experienced a major up-move on extremely high volume (Jan 5, RelVol 3.54, CLV 0.73) followed immediately by a sharp reversal on high volume (Jan 12, RelVol 1.85, CLV -0.26). The last two weeks confirm weakness: down bars on high volume, closing near the low (Jan 19 CLV -0.98; Jan 26 CLV -0.83). The Smart Money appears to be actively distributing the stock following a failed rally attempt (Upthrust after SOS).

**Key Levels:** 22.62 (Upthrust high), 12.30 (Key low support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below the long-term support at 12.30.
- **Invalidation:** 15.81 (High of the last down bar's open)
---
### AHR (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Test of Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stock is tagged for a Buying Climax. Volume was very high in the last week (RelVol 2.21), forming a wide-spread bar. However, the closing location (CLV 0.15) is mid-range, indicating significant supply entered the market, overpowering the initial momentum. This is a classic sign of an Upthrust or Test of Supply following a buying climax signal. The volume suggests Smart Money took profits.

**Key Levels:** 48.80 (Recent high/Upthrust), 45.37 (Immediate support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 45.37.
- **Invalidation:** 48.80 (High of the potential Upthrust bar)
---
### AIQ (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Effort No Result

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly status is a Buying Climax, suggesting underlying distribution. The recent weekly bar (Jan 26) is a wide spread down bar on average volume (RelVol 0.72), closing near the low (CLV -0.80). This confirms weakness after several weeks of minimal upward progress on high volume (Effort No Result). The move suggests Smart Money is driving prices down from the recent highs.

**Key Levels:** 53.94 (High of Climax), 51.76 (Immediate support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 51.76.
- **Invalidation:** 53.94 (High of the down bar)
---
### AL (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Monthly) / Climax Warning (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The price has been making extremely tight, small moves (Spreads 0.12 to 0.28) on low to average volume. The last bar is a tiny up bar with the highest possible CLV (1.0) on average volume. This narrow vertical movement, coupled with a confirmed Monthly Buying Climax, suggests extreme overbought conditions and exhausted demand (Blow-off on small spread). Smart Money may be finalizing distribution in a controlled manner.

**Key Levels:** 64.63 (Recent high/Resistance), 64.20 (Immediate support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 64.20 (Confirming weakness).
- **Invalidation:** 64.63 (High of the last bar)
---
### AMBA (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Confirmed Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stock has been under heavy supply pressure. The Jan 5 bar was a wide down bar on high volume (RelVol 1.81, CLV -0.88), suggesting strong distribution/stopping volume on the way down. The last weekly bar (Jan 26) is a wide spread down bar on average volume (RelVol 0.68), closing near the low (CLV -0.67), reinforcing the bearish pressure. The overall monthly picture is extremely weak (CLV -0.89).

**Key Levels:** 63.08 (Recent Low Support), 70.77 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 63.08.
- **Invalidation:** 69.05 (High of the last down bar)
---
### AMKR (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Effort No Result

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly context is a Buying Climax, suggesting distribution near the highs. The Jan 5 week was a wide up bar on very high volume (RelVol 2.0), but the upward drive immediately failed in the following weeks. The last bar (Jan 26) is a wide spread down bar (Spread 4.77) on average volume (RelVol 0.85), closing very low (CLV -0.77). This confirms selling pressure and a failed breakout attempt, likely marking an Upthrust or SOW.

**Key Levels:** 55.17 (Climax high/Upthrust), 47.79 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 47.79.
- **Invalidation:** 52.56 (High of the selling bar)

### AMZU (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly context is Supply Dominance. The week of Jan 5 saw a high volume surge (RelVol 1.08, CLV 0.94) which was immediately followed by a high volume reversal (Jan 12, RelVol 0.75, CLV -0.59). The last bar (Jan 26) is a down bar on average volume (RelVol 0.84), closing mid-low (CLV -0.55). This sequence suggests the rally was met by heavy supply, and the stock is now continuing its downward sequence within the monthly downtrend structure.

**Key Levels:** 40.40 (Resistance), 36.24 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 36.24.
- **Invalidation:** 39.71 (High of the last down bar)
---
### APH (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Confirmed Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly chart is marked as Supply Dominance. The last bar (Jan 26) is extremely significant: an exceptionally wide down bar (Spread 27.03) on massive volume (RelVol 2.23), closing very low (CLV -0.69). This is a definitive Sign of Weakness (SOW) or high-volume distribution, overwhelming previous buying efforts (Jan 12 rally). Smart Money is clearly selling aggressively into the market.

**Key Levels:** 167.04 (SOW high/Resistance), 140.00 (SOW low/Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a weak rally (LRS) to test the 150-155 zone, or break of 140.00.
- **Invalidation:** 167.04
---
### ARE (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Monthly) / Effort No Result (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly context suggests Stopping Volume, but the recent weekly action is bearish. Following strong upward momentum, the last bar (Jan 26) is a wide spread down bar (Spread 6.61) on high volume (RelVol 1.29), closing mid-low (CLV -0.54). This high volume selling activity suggests strong supply entering the market, likely distribution or a failed breakout attempt (Upthrust). This contradicts the bullish Quarterly context.

**Key Levels:** 59.76 (Resistance/Upthrust), 53.14 (Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 53.14.
- **Invalidation:** 59.76
---
### ARES (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Confirmed Weakness

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly context is Buying Climax, confirming Smart Money distribution at higher prices. The last two weeks confirm this view. The Jan 19 bar was a wide down bar on high volume, closing extremely low (CLV -0.97), a definite Sign of Weakness (SOW). The follow-up bar (Jan 26) is another wide down bar on high volume (RelVol 1.16), closing near the low (CLV -0.12). This sequence confirms sustained selling pressure and a major reversal from the high.

**Key Levels:** 177.72 (SOW High), 145.46 (SOW Low/Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 145.46.
- **Invalidation:** 155.09 (High of the last down bar)
---
### AS (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly context is Supply Dominance. The Jan 19 bar was a strong up bar closing high (CLV 0.98), suggesting demand return. However, the last bar (Jan 26) immediately negated this by being a wide down bar on high volume (RelVol 0.83), closing extremely low (CLV -0.79). This suggests the prior demand was met with overwhelming Smart Money supply. This is a potential Upthrust/SOW following a minor rally.

**Key Levels:** 38.91 (Upthrust high), 36.37 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 36.37.
- **Invalidation:** 38.91
---
### ASML (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Upthrust

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly chart is flagged for Buying Climax. The last bar (Jan 26) is a wide spread bar on massive volume (RelVol 1.95), making a new high ($1493.47). However, the bar closes substantially off the high, near the low (CLV -0.30), showing a significant reversal within the period. This massive effort with poor result suggests professional supply entering the market (Upthrust or major distribution).

**Key Levels:** 1493.48 (Climax High), 1385.16 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 1385.16.
- **Invalidation:** 1493.48
---
### ATO (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Effort No Result

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly chart is flagged for Buying Climax. The Jan 19 bar was a wide down bar on high volume (RelVol 1.77), closing mid-low (CLV -0.58). The last bar (Jan 26) is a down bar on exceptionally high volume (RelVol 2.22), closing mid-low (CLV -0.22). The sustained high volume selling, coupled with a lack of significant upward momentum, confirms that Smart Money is distributing in this range (165-172).

**Key Levels:** 172.09 (Resistance), 164.40 (Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 164.40.
- **Invalidation:** 169.39 (High of the last down bar)
---
### AVAV (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Confirmed Weakness

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly context is Buying Climax. The weekly sequence shows extreme volatility. The Jan 19 bar was a massive down bar (Spread 90.04) on high volume (RelVol 1.44), closing near the low (CLV -0.82), a definitive SOW. The last bar (Jan 26) followed through with another wide down bar on high volume, closing extremely low (CLV -0.92). This confirms strong selling pressure following the recent blow-off top (Jan 12 high of 408.25).

**Key Levels:** 408.25 (Buying Climax High), 276.76 (Immediate Support/SOW Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 276.76.
- **Invalidation:** 321.04 (High of the last down bar)
---
### BABX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly context is Supply Dominance. The weekly chart shows a sharp failure in the last week (Jan 26). The bar is a wide spread down bar (Spread 6.75) on high volume (RelVol 1.18), closing extremely low (CLV -0.88). This follows a sharp rally attempt (Jan 19, CLV 0.15) which failed quickly. This confirms the presence of strong Smart Money supply, reversing the previous move up (likely an Upthrust after SOW).

**Key Levels:** 53.35 (Resistance/Upthrust high), 46.36 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 46.36.
- **Invalidation:** 53.11 (High of the last down bar)
---
### BAH (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Confirmed Weakness

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly context is Buying Climax, and the weekly action confirms massive selling. Following weeks of strong upward momentum, the last bar (Jan 26) is a devastatingly wide spread down bar (Spread 15.80) on huge volume (RelVol 1.72), closing near the low (CLV -0.84). This is a textbook Sign of Weakness (SOW) or high-volume Upthrust, signaling major distribution by Smart Money after running the price up to 109.00.

**Key Levels:** 109.10 (Climax High/SOW), 87.20 (SOW Low/Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 87.20.
- **Invalidation:** 103.00 (Open of the SOW bar)
---
### BANC (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Monthly) / Effort No Result

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly context is 'Confirmed Strong Buying Climax'. The last two weeks show rejection near the highs. The Jan 19 bar was a wide down bar closing extremely low (CLV -0.96) on high volume (RelVol 0.97). This is a Sign of Weakness. The follow-up bar (Jan 26) is a much narrower down bar on average volume, closing mid-low (CLV -0.16). While volume dropped, the lack of immediate demand response suggests weakness remains, testing the selling pressure.

**Key Levels:** 21.61 (Climax high), 19.67 (Immediate support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 19.67.
- **Invalidation:** 20.41 (High of the last down bar)
---
### BBT (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Monthly) / Effort No Result

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly context is Buying Climax. The weekly charts show difficulty sustaining movement above 28.00. The Jan 19 bar had a wide spread (2.62) but closed near the open (CLV -0.04), indicating supply entered. The last bar (Jan 26) is a narrow spread up bar on high volume (RelVol 0.93), but closed mid-range (CLV -0.06). High volume without significant upward progress confirms Effort No Result and potential distribution by Smart Money.

**Key Levels:** 29.63 (Resistance/Climax high), 27.71 (Immediate support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 27.71.
- **Invalidation:** 29.07 (High of the last bar)
---
### BEP (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Monthly) / Weakness confirmed

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly context is Supply Dominance. The rally attempts in the previous three weeks were lackluster (moderate volume, mixed closes). The last bar (Jan 26) is a wide spread up bar on high volume (RelVol 1.08), but the closing price is significantly off the high (CLV 0.40). This is a potential Upthrust or a weak rally being sold into by Smart Money, confirming the monthly distribution.

**Key Levels:** 30.51 (Resistance), 28.21 (Immediate support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A down bar on high volume breaking 28.21.
- **Invalidation:** 30.51
---
### BFH (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Strong Demand Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence is flagged for Stopping Volume. The Jan 12 bar was a wide down bar on high volume (RelVol 2.26), but closed high (CLV 0.86), indicating Smart Money absorption. The subsequent bar (Jan 19) was a narrow down bar on low volume, closing very low (CLV -0.91), suggesting a sharp, low-volume Test of the low that quickly reversed. The last bar (Jan 26) is an up bar on high volume (RelVol 1.26), closing mid-high (CLV 0.45), indicating demand returning and absorbing supply. This accumulation pattern looks promising.

**Key Levels:** 67.78 (Accumulation Low), 74.23 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 74.23 on strong volume.
- **Invalidation:** 67.78
---
### BHP (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / SOW confirmed

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly chart is flagged for Buying Climax. The last bar (Jan 26) is a wide spread bar on exceptionally high volume (RelVol 1.84), making a new high ($74.98) but closing dramatically off the high, mid-low (CLV -0.67). This is a powerful indication of an Upthrust or SOW, where Smart Money aggressively sold into the market strength. The prior demand is being absorbed.

**Key Levels:** 74.98 (Upthrust High), 67.51 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 67.51.
- **Invalidation:** 74.98
---
### BKKT (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Confirmed Weakness

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly context is Buying Climax, suggesting distribution. The Jan 12 bar was a wide up bar on high volume (RelVol 1.05), closing high (CLV 0.78), potentially marking the climax. This was followed by extreme weakness: The Jan 19 bar was a wide down bar on high volume, closing extremely low (CLV -0.72). The last bar (Jan 26) continued the weakness, a wide down bar on average volume, closing very low (CLV -0.68). This confirms strong Smart Money selling and a rapid reversal from the highs.

**Key Levels:** 22.11 (Climax high), 12.97 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 12.97.
- **Invalidation:** 15.61 (High of the last down bar)
---
### BKSY (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Monthly) / SOW

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly context is Buying Climax. The price has been in a strong rally phase. The last bar (Jan 26) is a wide spread down bar (Spread 6.50) on high volume (RelVol 0.87), closing near the low (CLV -0.91). This is a clear Sign of Weakness (SOW) indicating aggressive supply has entered the market and overwhelmed the prior demand, initiating a reversal.

**Key Levels:** 29.79 (Recent High), 21.80 (SOW Low/Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 21.80.
- **Invalidation:** 28.30 (High of the SOW bar)
---
### BNS (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Weakness Confirmed

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly chart is flagged for Supply Dominance. The Jan 5 bar was a wide down bar on high volume (RelVol 1.88), closing mid-low (CLV -0.60), showing supply entering. The price attempted a recovery, but the last bar (Jan 26) is a down bar on average volume, closing mid-low (CLV -0.59). This suggests the rally failed upon testing the supply zone, confirming that bearish pressure remains dominant and the trend is turning down.

**Key Levels:** 76.56 (Resistance), 74.25 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 74.25.
- **Invalidation:** 76.56
---
### BP (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Confirmed Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence is 'Confirmed Early Supply Dominance'. The prior significant selling bar (Jan 5) was a wide down bar on very high volume (RelVol 1.85, CLV -0.37). The ensuing reaction rally (Jan 19) was strong. However, the last bar (Jan 26) is a wide up bar on high volume (RelVol 1.17), making a new high, but closing significantly off its high (CLV 0.16). This signals a potential Upthrust or Effort No Result, suggesting supply is returning to cap the price movement, confirming distribution after the long run up.

**Key Levels:** 38.89 (Upthrust High), 36.46 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A weak down bar breaking 36.46.
- **Invalidation:** 38.89
---
### BRKR (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Monthly) / Confirmed Weakness

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly context is Stopping Volume, suggesting potential accumulation. However, the weekly action is clearly bearish. The Jan 12 bar was a wide down bar on high volume (RelVol 1.06), closing near the low (CLV -0.86). The last bar (Jan 26) is a wide spread down bar on average volume (RelVol 0.87), closing very low (CLV -0.78). This continuous strong selling pressure (SOW) overrides the initial monthly Stopping Volume signal, indicating the underlying trend remains bearish and the support was easily broken.

**Key Levels:** 54.57 (Resistance), 43.53 (SOW Low/Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 43.53.
- **Invalidation:** 50.49 (High of the last down bar)
---
### BRZE (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Confirmed Weakness

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly context is 'Confirmed Early Buying Climax'. The weekly price action is extremely weak. The Jan 12 bar was a massive down bar on high volume (RelVol 1.55), closing near the low (CLV -0.95), a clear SOW. The rally attempt (Jan 19) failed immediately. The last bar (Jan 26) is a wide spread down bar on high volume (RelVol 1.44), closing near the absolute low (CLV -0.97). This confirms overwhelming supply and a rapid continuation of the bear trend from the climax.

**Key Levels:** 34.53 (Climax high), 20.75 (SOW Low/New Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 20.75.
- **Invalidation:** 26.14 (High of the last down bar)
---
### BSY (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly context is Supply Dominance, suggesting a distribution phase. The stock broke down sharply in the last week (Jan 26), forming a wide spread down bar (Spread 4.58) on average volume (RelVol 1.00), closing very low (CLV -0.72). This confirms that sellers are in control and overcoming the brief rally attempts earlier in the month. The selling continues to drive prices lower.

**Key Levels:** 40.66 (Resistance), 34.49 (SOW Low/Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 34.49.
- **Invalidation:** 39.07 (High of the last down bar)
---
### BWIN (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly context is Supply Dominance. The last bar (Jan 26) is a wide spread down bar (Spread 3.98) on high volume (RelVol 1.26), closing near the absolute low (CLV -0.96). This is an extremely bearish signal, confirming the supply dominance and indicating Smart Money is driving prices aggressively lower. The rally from Jan 5 to Jan 12 was successfully absorbed and reversed.

**Key Levels:** 27.01 (Resistance), 21.86 (SOW Low/Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 21.86.
- **Invalidation:** 25.85 (High of the last down bar)
---
### CCOI (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort to Rise

**Smart Money Logic:**
Following a large bullish bar (Week 2026-01-05), the price has held relatively high ground. The last bar is an up bar, closing near the middle (CLV 0.40) on low relative volume (0.44). Crucially, the spread is relatively narrow. This indicates a minor effort to rise that succeeded in closing higher, potentially encountering minimal supply. This suggests Smart Money is holding positions following the strong monthly close (CLV 0.73) in January, despite the overall BUYING_CLIMAX context.

**Key Levels:** 23.09 (Local Support), 24.81 (Local High Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and hold above 24.81 on increased volume, confirming absorbed supply.
- **Invalidation:** 23.09
---
### CDE (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Buying Climax Failure

**Smart Money Logic:**
The price has been in a strong bullish run (Monthly BUYING_CLIMAX). The last weekly bar shows an extremely wide spread down (Spread 7.75), closing very near the low (CLV -0.89) on enormous, climax volume (RelVol 2.01). This confirms that Smart Money aggressively distributed into the recent euphoria, marking a failed Buying Climax and a confirmed reversal point (Weekly SUPPLY_DOMINANCE).

**Key Levels:** 20.02 (Selling Climax Low), 27.77 (Buying Climax High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A subsequent weak rally (No Demand) or a break and hold below 20.02.
- **Invalidation:** 26.11 (Prior high close/Resistance)
---
### CNQ (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Effort to Rise

**Smart Money Logic:**
In a BULLISH_TREND, the sequence initiated with Stopping Volume (Week 2026-01-05) on massive volume and wide spread down, but a close well off the low (CLV 0.35). The price has since stabilized and moved up. The last bar is a wide spread up bar (Spread 2.68), closing slightly off the high (CLV 0.17) on high volume (RelVol 1.13). This is an Effort to Rise that succeeded in raising the price substantially, suggesting remaining supply near the highs is being absorbed. The monthly chart also shows strong bullish sentiment (CLV 0.72).

**Key Levels:** 35.64 (Local Support), 38.32 (High Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and hold above 38.32 on confirming volume.
- **Invalidation:** 35.64
---
### CSGP (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Distribution

**Smart Money Logic:**
Following a major down bar (Week 2026-01-05: wide spread, high volume, CLV -0.98), the price attempted a significant rally (Week 2026-01-12: wide spread up, very high volume, CLV 0.86) which looked like Stopping Volume/Accumulation. However, the last bar is a wide spread down (Spread 9.79), closing near the low (CLV -0.85) on high volume (RelVol 1.63). This is a strong confirmation of the prior SUPPLY_DOMINANCE and suggests the rally was a weak secondary effort meeting heavy distribution, confirming a downward thrust. The monthly CLV is highly negative (-0.33).

**Key Levels:** 60.77 (Local Support), 70.57 (Distribution High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and hold below 60.77 on confirming volume.
- **Invalidation:** 65.60 (Prior support/resistance pivot)
---
### CTRA (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Effort to Rise

**Smart Money Logic:**
The initial BUYING_CLIMAX signal (Weekly Sequence: CONFIRMED_EARLY) was followed by a sharp drop (Week 2026-01-05). However, the last two weeks showed strong demand stepping in. The latest bar is an up bar with a wide spread (2.05) closing near the high (CLV 0.79) on good volume (RelVol 1.12). This is a strong Effort to Rise, overcoming the prior distribution/climax fears. The monthly CLV is highly bullish (0.90). This indicates Smart Money is back in control, pushing prices higher.

**Key Levels:** 27.00 (Local Support), 29.06 (New High Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and hold above 29.06 on confirming volume.
- **Invalidation:** 27.00
---
### DUOL (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Continuation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stock is in a severe BEARISH_TREND, confirmed by Monthly SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The last weekly bar is a wide spread down (Spread 22.38), closing near the absolute low (CLV -0.94) on high volume (RelVol 1.09). This confirms heavy supply pressure continuing to drive the price down without absorption. The monthly CLV is also extremely negative (-0.98). This is an unmistakable sign of weakness.

**Key Levels:** 133.50 (New Support Low), 155.89 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and hold below 133.50 on confirming volume.
- **Invalidation:** 155.89

### ENR (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort to Rise

**Smart Money Logic:**
In a BULLISH_TREND, the price stabilized after a prior drop (Week 2026-01-12, CLV -0.70). The last bar is a strong Effort to Rise, characterized by a wide spread up (Spread 2.46), closing near the high (CLV 0.64) on high volume (RelVol 1.55). This indicates strong demand stepping in and absorbing any available supply, leading to a strong recovery from the prior weakness. The monthly context is bullish (CLV 0.73).

**Key Levels:** 21.83 (New High Close), 19.81 (Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry on pullbacks to $21.00 or break above the current high of $22.27.
- **Invalidation:** 19.81

### FHB (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Distribution

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar shows a wide spread down (Spread 2.00) closing below the mid-point (CLV -0.55) on extremely high volume (RelVol 1.93). This indicates sustained SUPPLY_DOMINANCE in the current weak phase, suggesting Smart Money is distributing. The inability of the price to close strongly despite the prior positive weekly bars points to weakness entering the market, confirming the weekly SUPPLY_DOMINANCE signal.

**Key Levels:** 26.10 (Support), 28.10 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and hold below 26.10 on increased volume.
- **Invalidation:** 28.10
---
### FIBK (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Following a month of high volume but mixed results (Monthly BUYING_CLIMAX WATCH_FOR_TEST), the last weekly bar is a wide spread down (Spread 3.02) closing near the low (CLV -0.94) on strong volume (RelVol 0.96). This is a strong sign of weakness, confirming that supply is overwhelming demand. The close is highly indicative of institutional selling, especially after the prior week's attempt to test the highs failed (CLV -0.49).

**Key Levels:** 35.38 (Support Low), 38.41 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and hold below 35.38 on confirming volume.
- **Invalidation:** 36.85 (Prior weekly close)
---
### FISV (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
In a BULLISH_TREND, the monthly context signals SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The last weekly bar is a wide spread down (Spread 5.24) closing near the low (CLV -0.59) on normal volume (RelVol 0.93). This indicates a strong push down by supply, failing to hold the prior week's gains (CLV 0.95). The consistent failure to maintain upward momentum and the heavy down close suggest supply is controlling the market. The high volume indicates institutional participation in the downward move.

**Key Levels:** 62.67 (Local Support Low), 67.91 (Resistance High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and hold below 62.67 on confirming volume.
- **Invalidation:** 67.56 (Prior weekly close)
---
### GBCI (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort to Rise

**Smart Money Logic:**
The price is in a clear BULLISH_TREND, despite a Monthly SUPPLY_DOMINANCE warning. The last weekly bar is a wide spread up (Spread 3.74), closing strongly near the high (CLV 0.79) on high volume (RelVol 1.30). This is a strong Effort to Rise, overcoming resistance and indicating renewed institutional demand. The monthly CLV is very strong (0.90), backing this momentum.

**Key Levels:** 50.68 (New High Close), 47.32 (Local Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry on minor pullback or break above 51.06.
- **Invalidation:** 47.32
---
### GE (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort to Rise (Absorption)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Following a major distribution bar (Week 2026-01-19: wide spread down, high volume, CLV -0.77), the market showed extreme weakness. The last bar is a counter-thrust: a wide spread up bar (Spread 17.27), closing near the high (CLV 0.90) on high volume (RelVol 1.56). This powerful reversal, absorbing the supply from the prior week, suggests Smart Money is aggressively buying, indicating potential accumulation in a bullish quarterly context. This is a very strong bullish signal.

**Key Levels:** 293.00 (Support Open), 307.60 (Local High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry on consolidation near $300 or break above $307.60.
- **Invalidation:** 293.00
---
### GNTX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is a down bar with a moderate spread (1.85) closing near the low (CLV -0.24) on high volume (RelVol 1.24). This indicates persistent selling pressure, despite the prior narrow-range bar (Week 2026-01-19). This movement confirms the Monthly SUPPLY_DOMINANCE context, showing that the recent push higher has stalled and sellers are regaining control. The price is failing to hold above key support levels.

### GWRE (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Continuation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stock is in a severe BEARISH_TREND, confirmed by Quarterly and Weekly SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The last weekly bar is a wide spread down (Spread 23.21), closing extremely near the low (CLV -0.95) on strong volume (RelVol 1.41). This is a decisive signal of continuing distribution and selling pressure, suggesting a swift continuation of the downtrend. The monthly CLV is also extremely negative (-0.98).

**Key Levels:** 140.25 (New Low Support), 163.46 (Resistance)

### HPE (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Demand Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stock is in a BEARISH_TREND, but the monthly context confirms STOPPING_VOLUME (CONFIRMED_EARLY). The last two weekly bars are narrow range, indicating lack of selling conviction after the prior drop. The last bar is an up bar, closing marginally higher (CLV 0.01) on normal volume (RelVol 0.54). This narrow spread on volume, after a period of high volume selling (Weeks 2026-01-05/12), suggests a successful Test for supply, confirming Smart Money is accumulating in the zone.

**Key Levels:** 21.02 (Accumulation Support), 22.01 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 22.01 on increased volume, confirming upward intent.
- **Invalidation:** 21.02
---
### HPQ (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Weak Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
In a BEARISH_TREND, the last bar is an up bar with a very narrow spread (0.71), closing slightly above the mid-point (CLV 0.38) on high volume (RelVol 1.34). The high volume on such a narrow bar and weak close suggests Effort No Result/Weak Demand, as Smart Money is distributing into any rallies. The monthly chart strongly confirms SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (CLV -0.72).

**Key Levels:** 18.94 (Support Low), 19.66 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and hold below 18.94 on confirming volume.
- **Invalidation:** 19.66
---
### IMAX (NEUTRAL/BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Demand Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stock is in a BEARISH_TREND but the monthly context suggests STOPPING_VOLUME. The price saw a strong rally (Week 2026-01-12, CLV 0.90) followed by a sharp reversal down (Week 2026-01-19, CLV -0.82). The latest bar is a narrow spread bar (1.59) closing near the high (CLV 0.50) on low volume (RelVol 0.58). This low volume activity after sharp moves suggests supply has temporarily dried up (Test), confirming demand is holding the price in this range.

**Key Levels:** 33.71 (Support Low), 35.30 (Local High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and hold above 35.30 on confirming volume.
- **Invalidation:** 33.71

### INVH (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Supply Absorption

**Smart Money Logic:**
The sequence confirms STOPPING_VOLUME (CONFIRMED_EARLY/WATCH_FOR_TEST). The last bar is a narrow spread bar (1.26) closing near the low (CLV -0.03) on high volume (RelVol 1.26). This is a key absorption signal (selling absorbed), indicating Smart Money is consolidating positions near the support level ($26.12). The prior week's positive action confirms demand is entering the market after the earlier selling climax (Week 2026-01-05).

**Key Levels:** 26.12 (Accumulation Support), 27.39 (Local Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 27.39 on confirming volume.
- **Invalidation:** 26.12
---
### IONQ (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Continuation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly context signaled a BUYING_CLIMAX failure (CLV -0.86). The last weekly bar is a wide spread down (Spread 11.67), closing near the low (CLV -0.81) on high volume (RelVol 1.02). This confirms heavy institutional selling and distribution, indicating continuation of the established bearish trend after the rally failed. This bar shows decisive weakness.

**Key Levels:** 38.91 (New Low Support), 50.59 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and hold below 38.91 on confirming volume.
- **Invalidation:** 47.25 (Prior weekly close)
---
### IONX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Continuation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stock is in a sharp BEARISH_TREND. The last weekly bar is a wide spread down (Spread 11.08), closing extremely near the low (CLV -0.83) on high volume (RelVol 2.02). This is a clear signal of institutional distribution and panic selling (SUPPLY_DOMINANCE confirmed). The price is failing dramatically, with the large spread and high volume confirming the breakdown. The monthly CLV is also extremely negative (-0.87).

**Key Levels:** 15.21 (New Low Support), 23.91 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and hold below 15.21 on confirming volume.
- **Invalidation:** 23.91
---
### IOT (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Continuation

**Smart Money Logic:**
In a BEARISH_TREND, the monthly context signals BUYING_CLIMAX failure. The last weekly bar is a wide spread down (Spread 4.95), closing extremely near the low (CLV -0.91) on high volume (RelVol 1.51). This confirms overwhelming supply pressure and institutional selling, continuing the bearish momentum from the prior week's negative close. The inability of price to stabilize suggests distribution is ongoing.

**Key Levels:** 27.84 (New Low Support), 32.80 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and hold below 27.84 on confirming volume.
- **Invalidation:** 32.80
---
### JPM (NEUTRAL/BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort to Rise (Absorption)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is a strong recovery bar following two weeks of sharp selling (Distribution/Climax). The bar is wide spread up (Spread 10.45) closing strongly near the high (CLV 0.61) on high volume (RelVol 1.15). This indicates strong demand absorption, suggesting Smart Money has stepped in to counter the recent distribution. While the monthly CLV is negative (-0.53), this weekly bar marks a strong change of character back towards bullishness.

**Key Levels:** 297.45 (Support Low), 307.90 (Resistance High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and hold above 307.90 on confirming volume.
- **Invalidation:** 297.45
---
### KEY (NEUTRAL/BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Weak Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
The price is showing low volatility and consolidation in a bullish quarterly trend. The last bar is a narrow spread up bar (0.71), closing above the mid-point (CLV 0.28) on high volume (RelVol 0.85). High volume on a narrow up bar suggests absorption of supply, potentially marking a successful 'Test' in the consolidation zone, despite the Monthly SUPPLY_DOMINANCE warning. Smart Money is consolidating for a potential markup.

**Key Levels:** 21.06 (Support), 21.77 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and hold above 21.77 on confirming volume.
- **Invalidation:** 21.06
---
### KVYO (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Continuation

**Smart Money Logic:**
Following a sharp reversal (Week 2026-01-12, CLV -0.96), the price attempted to rally (Week 2026-01-19, CLV 0.40) but failed. The last bar is a wide spread down (Spread 4.29) closing extremely near the low (CLV -0.91) on normal volume (RelVol 1.00). This confirms continued SUPPLY_DOMINANCE and institutional selling, invalidating the bullish recovery attempt and reinforcing the BEARISH_TREND, despite the Stopping Volume alert.

**Key Levels:** 22.03 (New Low Support), 26.33 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and hold below 22.03 on confirming volume.
- **Invalidation:** 25.79 (Last weekly open)
---
### LHX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Weekly) / Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly context is BULLISH, but the recent price action indicates aggressive supply. The last weekly bar was a wide down spread on high volume (RelVol 1.37), closing near the low (CLV -0.78). This is classic SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (often a Sign of Weakness or Upthrust) following a Weekly BUYING_CLIMAX detected two weeks ago. Smart Money is aggressively selling into this rally. This breakdown suggests a significant correction is imminent.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 369.59 (BC high), Initial Support: 339.61 (Last week low), Major Support: 307.15

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below 339.61 on high volume, confirming the breakdown.
- **Invalidation:** 361.59 (If price recovers and holds above the previous week's high)
---
### MAN (BULLISH (Aggressive))
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result (Weekly) / Buying Climax Potential

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar was an exceptional Wide Spread Up on very high volume (RelVol 1.56), closing at the absolute high (CLV 0.997). This is massive EFFORT and RESULT. Although the Monthly context warns of SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (WATCH_FOR_TEST), this aggressive institutional buying overrides the immediate monthly warning. This looks like a major breakout/markup phase initiation.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: New Highs (Above 36.34), Immediate Support: 33.00 (Mid-range of spike bar), Major Support: 28.63 (Last week low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Consolidation above 36.34, or a successful Test of 33.00.
- **Invalidation:** 31.28 (If price dips back deeply into the breakout bar)
---
### MOD (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Weekly Confirmed)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly chart shows a pronounced STOPPING_VOLUME action. The latest bar is a huge wide spread up on exceptionally high volume (RelVol 1.73), closing near the high (CLV 0.78). This confirms strong demand stepping in, potentially marking the end of the prior markdown. The prior weekly bar was also strong demand (CLV 0.70). This suggests Smart Money accumulation/markup starting.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: New Highs (Above 190.22), Support/Test Zone: 145.00 - 150.00, Accumulation Low: 111.18

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A continuation of strength above 190.22, or a successful retest of 145.00 on low volume.
- **Invalidation:** 139.25 (Loss of recent low, indicating failure of stopping action)
---
### MSFU (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Weekly Confirmed)

**Smart Money Logic:**
In a clear Quarterly BEARISH_TREND, the last weekly bar showed extreme volume (RelVol 5.77) with a wide spread down, closing near the low (CLV -0.68). This is highly aggressive SUPPLY_DOMINANCE, confirming the monthly sequence. This represents a waterfall move, indicating institutional panic selling or capitulation.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 38.00 (Prior open), Immediate Support: 30.43 (New Low), Previous Support: 36.67

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Consolidation followed by a break below 30.43, or a rally to test 36.00 and rejection.
- **Invalidation:** 40.96 (Recovery above the massive distribution bar's high)
---
### NET (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Weekly Confirmed) / Extreme Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Weekly chart signaled a BUYING_CLIMAX followed by a decisive rejection. The last weekly bar displayed extreme volume (RelVol 2.78) with a wide spread down, closing near the low (CLV -0.89). Price attempted a sharp rally (High 218.22) but was met with massive supply, leading to a huge reversal bar. This is a potential Upthrust After Distribution (UTAD) or Spring failure, indicating heavy institutional selling in a BEARISH Quarterly Trend.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 218.22 (Upthrust high), Immediate Support: 175.07 (New Low), Support: 168.94 (Monthly Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below 175.07, confirming the bearish structure.
- **Invalidation:** 205.20 (If price recovers significantly into the distribution zone)
---
### NICE (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result / Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Despite the Quarterly BULLISH_TREND, the Monthly Sequence points to SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The last weekly bar was a very wide spread down on moderate volume (RelVol 0.93), closing near the low (CLV -0.92). This is classic Supply Dominance, suggesting institutional selling following the rally into 118. This action, combined with the monthly context, indicates a potential Phase C/D markdown.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 117.21 (Last week high), Support: 106.00 (New Weekly Low / Monthly Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below 106.00 on sustained volume.

---
### OKLO (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Monthly) / Confirmed Markdown

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart warns of a BUYING_CLIMAX. The last two weekly bars show massive supply pressure. The latest bar had very wide spread down on moderate volume (RelVol 0.73), closing near the low (CLV -0.91). This confirms aggressive selling and a continuation of the markdown started after the peak near 115. This is institutional selling in a BEARISH Quarterly Trend.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 95.10 (Last week high), Immediate Support: 78.91 (New Low), Monthly Support: 72.13

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below 78.91, or a failed rally into 86.00.

---
### OTIS (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Weekly Confirmed)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Trend is BEARISH. The weekly sequence flagged SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The last weekly bar was a wide down spread on very high volume (RelVol 2.10), closing near the low (CLV -0.62). This is a strong Sign of Weakness (SOW), confirming the institutional selling pressure. Price failed to hold the prior week's rally (CLV 0.97).

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 91.65 (Last week high), Immediate Support: 84.00 (New Low), Major Resistance: 90.98

#### Action Plan

---
### PB (NEUTRAL / CAUTIOUS BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Weekly Confirmed) / High Volume Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly chart detected STOPPING_VOLUME. The last bar was a massive wide spread down on very high volume (RelVol 2.32), but the close was mid-range (CLV -0.04). This bar strongly suggests absorption of supply/panic selling, which typically marks a buying point (Stopping Volume). The extreme volume confirms institutional interest at this low level (65.12).

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 73.26 (Last week high), Accumulation Low: 65.12, Immediate Support: 68.00 (Approximate mid-point of SV bar)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a No Supply test near 68.00-69.00 or clear confirmation of upward momentum above 73.00.
- **Invalidation:** 65.12 (If broken, the stopping volume failed)
---
### PGY (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result (Supply Dominance)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Trend is BEARISH and the Monthly Sequence is SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The last weekly bar was a wide spread down on moderate volume (RelVol 0.84), closing near the low (CLV -0.82). This is strong continuation of supply, confirming the dominance. Price failed to sustain a rally into 26.00 two weeks ago, showing weak hands absorbing losses.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 22.90 (Prior swing high), Immediate Support: 19.12 (New Low), Major Resistance: 26.80

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below 19.12 on increased volume.

### QTWO (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Monthly Confirmed) / Waterfall Move

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Trend is BEARISH, and Monthly Supply Dominance is CONFIRMED_EARLY. The last weekly bar was a wide spread down on high volume (RelVol 1.02), closing near the low (CLV -0.77).

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 68.67 (Last week open), Immediate Support: 60.24 (New Low), Major Resistance: 69.36

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below 60.24, or a test rally failure around 64.00.

---
### RARE (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Weekly Confirmed) / Effort No Result

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Trend is BEARISH, and both Weekly/Monthly sequences warn of SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The last weekly bar was a moderate spread down on moderate volume (RelVol 1.05), closing near the low (CLV -0.075). The close is slightly ambiguous, but the wide spread down from the open/high, after an attempt to rally into 25.00, suggests supply is suppressing demand. This pattern confirms sellers remain in control.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 25.00 (Weekly High), Immediate Support: 23.27 (Weekly Low), Major Support: 22.00 (Prior Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below 23.27 on increased volume.

---
### RGLD (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Aggressive Distribution

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Trend is BULLISH, but the Monthly sequence signals SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The last weekly bar was a huge wide spread down on high volume (RelVol 1.10), closing near the low (CLV -0.80). This move immediately followed three weeks of massive buying climax action that drove the price to 306. This violent reversal indicates strong institutional distribution/liquidation into the high. This is a potential Upthrust or UTAD.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 306.25 (Distribution High), Immediate Support: 258.59 (New Low), Support: 248.08

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below 258.59, confirming the markdown.

---
### RGTI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Monthly Buying Climax / Extreme Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Trend is BEARISH, and the Monthly context warns of a BUYING_CLIMAX. The last weekly bar was a very wide spread down on moderate volume (RelVol 0.48), closing near the low (CLV -0.82). While volume is below average for the last month, the wide spread and low CLV confirm strong institutional selling and failure of the recent rally attempts. This suggests continuation of the bearish trend.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 23.78 (Last week high), Immediate Support: 17.62 (New Low), Major Resistance: 26.70

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below 17.62 on increased volume.

### RKT (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result / Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Trend is BEARISH, and the Monthly sequence warns of SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The last weekly bar was a wide spread down on high volume (RelVol 1.02), closing mid/low (CLV -0.59). This action follows a previous week's rally (CLV 0.92, RelVol 1.30) that failed to sustain momentum, suggesting heavy supply absorption occurred around 23.00. The current bar confirms supply is reasserting control.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 21.37 (Last week high), Immediate Support: 17.05 (New Low), Major Resistance: 24.36 (Recent high)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below 17.05 on increased volume.

---
### RYAAY (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Weekly Confirmed) / High Volume Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly chart flagged STOPPING_VOLUME. The last two bars show price stabilizing and recovering after a strong down wave. The last weekly bar was a wide spread up on very high volume (RelVol 1.96), closing high (CLV 0.61). This strong response bar, following the test low at 66.75, suggests Smart Money absorbed supply and is pushing the price into a markup phase, confirming the prior stopping volume action.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 73.75 (Prior high), Accumulation Low: 66.75, Immediate Support: 68.73 (Last week open)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Pullback/Test (No Supply) toward 69.00 or a decisive break above 72.00.

---
### SA (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Monthly Confirmed) / Extreme Reversal

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart warns of SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The last weekly bar showed massive volume (RelVol 1.46) with a huge wide spread down, closing near the low (CLV -0.97). This is a dramatic reversal following a strong upward thrust the week prior. This is classic aggressive institutional selling (Upthrust/Distribution). This confirms the monthly supply context and suggests a strong markdown is underway.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 37.99 (Distribution High), Immediate Support: 28.13 (New Low), Prior Support: 31.75

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below 28.13, or a failed rally attempt (No Demand) into 30.00.

---
### SARO (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Weekly Confirmed) / Extreme Reversal

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Trend is BULLISH, but the weekly sequence flags SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The last weekly bar showed extreme volume (RelVol 4.19) with a wide spread down, closing near the low (CLV -0.91). This is massive distribution/liquidation, reversing the prior week's effort to rise (RelVol 3.72, CLV 0.07). This is a textbook Upthrust action, indicating the immediate bull run is likely exhausted.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 33.46 (Distribution High), Immediate Support: 30.77 (New Low), Major Support: 28.51

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below 30.77 on sustained volume.

### SATS (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Monthly Buying Climax / Aggressive Distribution

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart detected a BUYING_CLIMAX. The last weekly bar was a very wide spread down on high volume (RelVol 1.77), closing near the low (CLV -0.67). This strong Supply Dominance reverses the momentum from the previous weeks' rallies, indicating massive institutional distribution/liquidation after the recent parabolic move towards 132. This is a potential Upthrust.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 131.94 (Distribution High), Immediate Support: 109.57 (New Low), Major Support: 107.59

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below 109.57, confirming the markdown.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 23.13 (Last week high), Immediate Support: 21.80 (New Low), Major Resistance: 23.96

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below 21.80 on increased volume.

### SPOT (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Weekly Confirmed) / Effort No Result

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Trend is BEARISH, and the weekly sequence flagged SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The last weekly bar was a wide down spread on moderate volume (RelVol 0.98), closing mid-range (CLV -0.47). This is Effort No Result to the downside, but the supply is clearly overwhelming any transient demand, continuing the bearish pattern initiated by the large SOW two weeks ago (CLV -0.84). The market is still trapped below 517.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 520.00 (Last week high), Immediate Support: 493.31 (New Low), Major Resistance: 548.55

This is strong Supply Dominance, indicating aggressive institutional selling and a continuation of the bearish trend. This move significantly negates the bounce from two weeks prior (CLV 0.52).

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 77.57 (Last week high), Immediate Support: 71.86 (New Low), Major Resistance: 81.84

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below 71.86 on sustained volume.

### TFX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Weekly Confirmed)

The Quarterly Trend is BEARISH, and the weekly sequence flagged SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The last bar was a moderate spread down on high volume (RelVol 1.59), closing mid/low (CLV -0.29). This is continued supply pressure, although not as extreme as the prior down-wave (CLV -0.93, two weeks ago). It suggests supply is still easily overwhelming demand at these lower levels.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 106.98 (Last week high), Immediate Support: 102.95 (Last week low), Major Resistance: 112.90

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below 102.95 on increased volume.

---
### TXT (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Weekly Confirmed)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Trend is BULLISH, but the weekly sequence flagged SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The last bar was a massive wide spread down on very high volume (RelVol 2.02), closing mid/low (CLV -0.34). This confirms institutional selling/liquidation, aggressively pushing the price down from the open (95.16). This action negates the three previous weeks of upward grind, suggesting a significant Sign of Weakness (SOW) is developing.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 95.72 (Distribution High), Immediate Support: 84.32 (New Low), Major Support: 92.34

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below 84.32 on sustained volume.
- **Invalidation:** 93.58 (Recovery above the prior week's open)
---
### UNH (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Weekly Confirmed) / Extreme Reversal

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Trend is BEARISH, and the weekly sequence flagged SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The last weekly bar was a huge wide spread down on extreme volume (RelVol 2.97), closing near the low (CLV -0.82). This is catastrophic selling, reversing the prior week's strong rally (CLV 0.89). This represents massive institutional distribution/panic selling and confirms the bearish trend is firmly in control. Potential collapse in price.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 354.79 (Distribution High), Immediate Support: 280.40 (New Low), Prior Support: 326.50

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below 280.40, confirming the markdown.
- **Invalidation:** 353.95 (Recovery above the open of the distribution bar)
---
### WGMI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Monthly Buying Climax / Aggressive Distribution

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart detected a BUYING_CLIMAX (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The last weekly bar was a wide spread down on high volume (RelVol 1.15), closing near the low (CLV -0.82). This is a strong Sign of Weakness, confirming institutional selling after the rally into 52.00. The rejection confirms that supply is active, likely leveraging the Buying Climax distribution phase.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 52.01 (Distribution High), Immediate Support: 44.39 (New Low), Prior Support: 45.11

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below 44.39 on sustained volume.
- **Invalidation:** 48.77 (If price recovers the open of the distribution bar)
---
### WHR (NEUTRAL / CAUTIOUS BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Weekly Confirmed) / Shakeout

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly chart flagged STOPPING_VOLUME. The last bar was a wide spread down on very high volume (RelVol 2.11), but closed mid-range (CLV 0.11). This strong reversal action from the high (85.84) to the low (72.55) suggests a massive shakeout or heavy institutional absorption of supply (Stopping Volume). The high volume indicates institutional activity at the extreme low. This often precedes a markup after accumulation/shakeout.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 85.84 (Last week high), Accumulation Low: 72.55, Immediate Support: 78.00 (Approximate mid-point of SV bar)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a successful Test (No Supply) near 78.00, or a break above 85.84 on follow-through volume.
- **Invalidation:** 72.55 (If broken, the stopping action failed)
---
### WPM (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Weekly Confirmed) / Extreme Reversal

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Trend is BULLISH, but the weekly sequence flagged SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The last bar was a huge wide spread down on very high volume (RelVol 1.90), closing near the low (CLV -0.89). This is a violent reversal following strong upward momentum, indicating aggressive institutional distribution/liquidation into the high near 160. This is a potential Upthrust or UTAD, signaling an end to the immediate rally.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 160.36 (Distribution High), Immediate Support: 130.35 (New Low), Prior Support: 137.22

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below 130.35 on sustained volume.
- **Invalidation:** 152.12 (Recovery above the open of the distribution bar)
---
## 👀 Watch/Monitoring
### ABT (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
The most recent weekly bar shows high volume (RelVol 2.37) on a relatively wide spread, closing mid-high (CLV 0.57). This follows an extremely high volume down bar (RelVol 2.57, CLV -0.80) which suggests selling climax/Stopping Volume. The market failed to fall further on the recent high volume, indicating Smart Money absorption, despite the quarterly bearish trend.

**Key Levels:** 105.27 (Low of potential Stopping Volume), 121.00 (Previous major support/supply test level)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A subsequent weekly 'Test' on low volume near 105-107, or a clear rally above the 121 resistance.
- **Invalidation:** 105.27 (Below the low of the Stopping Volume bar)
---
### ACLX (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance Test Failure

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is bullish, but the monthly context is Supply Dominance. The last two weeks saw high volume (RelVol 1.51, 0.93). The second-to-last week (Jan 19) was a wide spread upthrust (high $76.50) closing low (CLV -0.67). The final week (Jan 26) was a narrow spread up bar on lower volume (CLV 0.11), indicating a failed follow-through after major selling. This suggests Smart Money is neutralizing the stock near 68-70, unable to push higher.

**Key Levels:** 76.50 (Recent high/Upthrust), 66.00 (Immediate support), 60.35 (Major support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A clear break and hold above 70 or a decisive break below 66.
- **Invalidation:** N/A (Too choppy for immediate entry)
---
### AEO (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Selling Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly context suggests a Buying Climax, but the weekly context is dominated by selling. The Jan 19 week saw a wide down bar closing near the low (CLV -0.95). The latest week (Jan 26) saw a subsequent drop on slightly lower volume, showing effort (Spread 1.47), but the CLV is also negative (-0.42). While the monthly context suggests a climax, the intense selling pressure in the last two weeks (down, down) means weakness is currently dominant. This requires confirmation of stopping action.

**Key Levels:** 22.89 (Recent Low/Potential Selling Climax), 24.00 (Intermediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A clear 'Test' or 'No Supply' signal near 22.89.
- **Invalidation:** 22.89 (If broken, expect deep decline)
---
### AGIO (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Monthly) / Weakness (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly chart indicates Stopping Volume, but the weekly action is struggling. The Jan 19 week showed a strong up bar closing high (CLV 0.60), suggesting demand returning. However, the last week (Jan 26) was an aggressive down bar (Spread 2.97) on higher than average volume (RelVol 0.76), closing very low (CLV -0.67). This indicates weakness following the rally, suggesting the prior demand was likely short-covering, not sustained accumulation.

**Key Levels:** 26.25 (Monthly/Weekly Support), 29.93 (Recent high resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A successful re-test of the 26.25 low with minimal volume, or a break above 29.93.
- **Invalidation:** 26.25
---
### AIG (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Confirmed Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence is 'Confirmed Early Supply Dominance'. The Jan 5 bar was an extreme wide down bar on very high volume (RelVol 1.8, CLV -0.92), marking the initial break. Although the last bar (Jan 26) was an up bar closing high (CLV 0.96) on average volume, it is merely a minor reaction rally following a massive drop. This rally is likely testing the new supply zone created by the previous collapse, but volume is not convincing enough for demand return.

**Key Levels:** 75.00 (New resistance zone), 71.25 (Key support/low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Weakness (Supply) returning upon reaching 75.00-76.00.
- **Invalidation:** 76.04 (High of previous reaction bar)
---
### ALC (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Monthly) / Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly chart indicates Stopping Volume. The recent weekly bars show volatility contracting. The last bar is an up bar on moderate volume (RelVol 0.61), with a mid-to-high close (CLV 0.10). This follow-through is lackluster after the Jan 19 up bar (CLV 0.04). The failure to produce a strong rally after the initial high-volume weakness (Jan 5/Jan 12) suggests demand is only moderate and the consolidation is still within the monthly stopping volume range.

**Key Levels:** 82.50 (Resistance/Stopping Volume High), 79.81 (Immediate support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A strong break above 82.50 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** 77.88 (Low of the Jan 12 bar)
---
### ALL (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Confirmed Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence is confirmed 'Supply Dominance'. The Jan 12 bar was a major down move on extremely high volume (RelVol 2.04), closing near the low (CLV -0.949), a clear Sign of Weakness (SOW). The subsequent two weeks show attempts to rally. The last bar (Jan 26) is a relatively wide up bar closing high (CLV 0.71) on average volume (RelVol 0.82). This rally looks like a short-term reaction, testing the supply zone created by the SOW.

**Key Levels:** 215.00 (Previous Resistance), 191.13 (Major Support/SOW Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A weak high-volume down bar (Supply returning) between 198-200.
- **Invalidation:** 200.03 (High of the last reaction bar)
---
### AMH (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Test of Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
Both weekly and monthly contexts show Stopping Volume, indicating Smart Money entering. The Jan 5 bar had extremely high volume (RelVol 2.52) but closed mid-range (CLV 0.14), suggesting absorption. The subsequent weeks saw a rally attempt (Jan 12, CLV 0.90) followed by weakness (Jan 19, CLV 0.07). The last bar (Jan 26) is a down bar on average volume, closing near the low (CLV -0.05), indicating a successful test of supply (low CLV, narrow range) but failing to sustain a rally. Waiting for accumulation confirmation.

**Key Levels:** 32.65 (Resistance), 30.60 (Support/Test Zone)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A strong up bar on high volume closing above 32.65.
- **Invalidation:** 30.60
---
### APLS (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Selling Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
The sequence shows extremes in both directions. The Jan 5 bar was a potential Buying Climax (CLV 0.91, high volume). This was immediately reversed by the Jan 12 bar (CLV -0.94, high volume), indicating a Selling Climax/Sharp SOW. The last bar (Jan 26) is an up bar on very high volume (RelVol 1.93), but closes mid-range (CLV 0.10). This indicates Smart Money buying is still meeting resistance/supply in this range, creating a volatile churning effect. Indecisive market action.

**Key Levels:** 23.79 (Resistance), 21.10 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for volatility to contract and a clear VSA signal (e.g., No Supply or Test).
- **Invalidation:** N/A (Too volatile)
---
### ARWR (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Confirmed Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence is 'Confirmed Strong Supply Dominance'. The prior bar (Jan 12) was a wide down bar on high volume, closing near the low. Although the last two weeks were up bars, they failed to rally significantly. The Jan 26 bar is an up bar on average volume, closing mid-range (CLV 0.18). Given the confirmed strong supply, this upward movement looks like a weak reaction rally (LRS) that is likely to fail, especially with volume not confirming strong demand.

**Key Levels:** 72.00 (Resistance), 65.45 (Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Weakness (Supply) returning upon reaching 72.00.
- **Invalidation:** 72.00
---
### AXTA (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Monthly) / Test of Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly context suggests Stopping Volume, implying accumulation. However, the last weekly bar (Jan 26) is a down bar on average volume, closing mid-low (CLV -0.61). This weakness suggests that supply is still present despite the underlying monthly accumulation signal. The price is now pulling back to test the low of the consolidation range (33.36 to 34.50).

**Key Levels:** 34.50 (Resistance), 33.36 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A definitive 'No Supply' or 'Test' signal near 33.36.
- **Invalidation:** 33.36
---
### AXTI (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Selling Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly context shows a Buying Climax, suggesting distribution, while the weekly chart is flagged for Supply Dominance. The week of Jan 5 saw a massive surge (RelVol 3.82) which reversed sharply the following week (Jan 12, CLV -0.37). The Jan 19 bar was a sharp down bar on high volume, closing near the low (CLV -0.86), likely a Selling Climax. The last bar (Jan 26) is an up bar on high volume (RelVol 1.46), closing mid-range (CLV 0.18). This high-volume up bar after intense selling suggests accumulation or aggressive short covering, leading to conflict between supply and demand near the low.

**Key Levels:** 26.66 (High resistance), 15.85 (Selling Climax Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A clear move above 20.38 or a failure below 15.85.
- **Invalidation:** N/A (Too volatile)
---
### AZN (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Upthrust Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly chart is flagged for Stopping Volume. The Jan 12 bar saw exceptionally high volume (RelVol 3.30) on a medium spread, closing mid-low (CLV -0.11), suggesting massive absorption. The rally that followed (Jan 19) was strong (CLV 0.97). However, the last bar (Jan 26) is a wide spread down bar on high volume (RelVol 1.14), closing near the low (CLV -0.83). This indicates the rally failed and strong supply returned, potentially marking an Upthrust or LRS above the absorbed supply. The high volume suggests continued conflict between buyers and sellers.

**Key Levels:** 96.18 (Resistance/Upthrust high), 92.46 (Immediate support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A clear rejection of supply near 96.18, or a break below 92.46.
- **Invalidation:** 96.18
---
### BBIO (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Test of Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly chart is flagged for Stopping Volume, suggesting Smart Money absorption in the 70-76 range (Jan 5/Jan 12). The rally attempt (Jan 19) was weak (CLV 0.08) on average volume. The last bar (Jan 26) is a narrow down bar on average volume, closing mid-low (CLV -0.30). This pullback suggests a mild test of supply, but the close location is not strong enough to confirm accumulation yet. The range is tightening.

**Key Levels:** 80.00 (Resistance), 75.83 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A clear 'Test' signal (low volume, narrow range up bar) near 75.83.
- **Invalidation:** 75.83
---
### BBWI (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Monthly) / Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly context is Supply Dominance, suggesting weakness. The weekly price action shows volatility. The Jan 19 bar was a down bar closing mid-low (CLV -0.13). The last bar (Jan 26) is a narrow spread bar on high volume (RelVol 0.66), closing high (CLV 0.61). This high CLV on relatively high volume, especially following selling pressure, suggests a demand response (potential accumulation attempt) near the 20.52 low. It's too early to call a definitive reversal against the monthly supply.

**Key Levels:** 23.73 (Resistance), 20.52 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A follow-through up bar on high volume, confirming demand.
- **Invalidation:** 20.52
---
### BE (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Upthrust

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stock has experienced extreme volatility. The monthly chart shows Stopping Volume, suggesting massive accumulation/short covering near the lows. However, the last weekly bar (Jan 26) is a wide spread bar on high volume (RelVol 0.86) that made a new high ($167.57) but closed dramatically lower (CLV -0.03). This massive reversal within the bar, on high volume, suggests a significant Upthrust or failed move by Smart Money, indicating supply has returned aggressively at the highs.

**Key Levels:** 167.57 (Upthrust High), 142.00 (Immediate Support/Open of SOW)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A clear break below 142.00.
- **Invalidation:** 167.57
---
### BHF (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Monthly) / Indecision

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly context is Buying Climax. The weekly chart shows very narrow ranges and low relative volume in the last three weeks, suggesting low interest and indecision near the highs. The last bar (Jan 26) is an extremely narrow bar on low volume, closing near the low (CLV -0.70). This overall lack of momentum and weak close after an extended bull run, combined with the monthly climax signal, suggests Smart Money is avoiding commitment and underlying weakness is likely brewing.

**Key Levels:** 64.69 (Resistance), 63.80 (Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A decisive break below 63.80 or above 64.69.
- **Invalidation:** N/A (Tight range)
---
### BRBR (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Monthly) / Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly context is Stopping Volume. The stock experienced extreme weakness (Jan 12 low $21.67). The rally attempt (Jan 19) was strong (CLV 0.66). However, the last bar (Jan 26) is a wide down bar on high volume (RelVol 1.20), closing mid-low (CLV -0.67). This suggests supply is still heavy, or the prior demand was merely short covering. The price is pulled back to test the recent low, indicating the accumulation phase is still underway and not confirmed.

**Key Levels:** 27.11 (Resistance), 24.43 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A sustained rally above 27.11 on confirming demand volume.
- **Invalidation:** 24.43
---
### BXSL (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar shows a wide spread down, closing near the low (CLV -0.82) on high volume (RelVol 0.89, but last 3 bars show increasing volume/spread volatility). The monthly chart confirms SUPPLY_DOMINANCE and WATCH_FOR_TEST, with January showing high volume and a heavy close near the low (-0.70 CLV). The price attempted to rally in the previous week (Week 2026-01-12) but failed, followed by persistent distribution. The last bar is a clear signal of weakness into the monthly supply context.

**Key Levels:** 25.58 (Previous Low Support), 26.71 (Resistance/Prior High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and hold below 25.57 on confirming volume.
- **Invalidation:** 26.51 (Last weekly high close)
---
### CADE (BEARISH (Short-term reversal potential))
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Selling Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly chart shows a very wide spread down (Spread 1.98) closing near the low (CLV -0.48) on extremely high volume (RelVol 4.78). This volume spike, especially within the context of Quarterly/Weekly/Monthly SUPPLY_DOMINANCE, suggests capitulation or a potential Selling Climax, often marking the end of a sharp down move. However, the close is not extreme enough to confirm immediate bullish reversal, necessitating a WATCH_FOR_TEST stage. The monthly CLV is highly negative (-0.80) with high relative volume (2.87).

**Key Levels:** 41.60 (Support Low), 43.00 (Recent S/R pivot), 45.17 (Prior High Close Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Confirmation of Selling Climax (e.g., No Supply test or immediate strong reversal bar).
- **Invalidation:** 45.17 (Break above indicates renewed strength, invalidating the supply argument)
---
### CAI (NEUTRAL/BULLISH (Wait for Confirmation))
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Selling Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar shows a wide spread down (Spread 3.71) closing extremely low (CLV -0.98), but on very high volume (RelVol 1.56). This massive volume spike accompanied by a sharp low close indicates intense selling pressure, potentially marking a Selling Climax, especially given the prior week's heavy selling. This often traps late sellers. The price is deep in a BEARISH_TREND, but this high volume could signal Smart Money stepping in. Needs a Test for confirmation.

**Key Levels:** 23.13 (Selling Climax Low), 26.78 (Recent Resistance/Prior Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Confirmation of demand (e.g., a Test on low volume or a strong bullish close next week).
- **Invalidation:** 22.50 (Break below the Selling Climax low)
---
### CALM (NEUTRAL/BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Effort to Rise

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar shows a wide spread up (Spread 5.02) closing strongly (CLV 0.46) on high volume (RelVol 1.27). This looks like an Effort to Rise, but the immediate monthly context shows significant volume and a high close (CLV 0.79), possibly indicating a blow-off or Buying Climax in the monthly context, despite the bullish weekly close. The current weekly bar is a strong bar, but its volume is only moderate relative to prior bars (1.27 vs 2.24). Given the prior large volatility and monthly context, this move up might be meeting heavy supply near $85.

**Key Levels:** 84.87 (High Resistance), 79.85 (Recent Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Clear sign of supply failure above 85 or a break below 79.85 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** 85.00 (Break above signals continuation of strength)
---
### CALX (NEUTRAL (Watch for Accumulation))
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Selling Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is a massive wide spread down (Spread 13.06) closing extremely low (CLV -0.93), accompanied by huge volume (RelVol 2.84). This pattern, deep within a BEARISH_TREND and following prior weeks of weakness, is characteristic of a Selling Climax. Smart Money is likely absorbing the panic selling. The price action confirms strong SUPPLY_DOMINANCE in the sequence, but the extreme nature of the bar suggests the momentum shift is near.

**Key Levels:** 44.25 (Selling Climax Low/Critical Support), 54.61 (Recent Open/Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A definitive Test on low volume or an immediate strong up thrust next week.
- **Invalidation:** 44.00 (Break below the Selling Climax low suggests continued panic)
---
### CBRL (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Demand Failure

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stock has experienced significant volatility in January, characterized by a wide-spread down bar on high volume (Week 2026-01-19, CLV -0.87). The latest bar is an attempt to rally, closing slightly positive (CLV 0.11) but on moderate spread and volume (RelVol 0.86). This looks like weak demand following heavy distribution signaled by the prior week's reversal. The overall monthly context remains negative (CLV -0.13), indicating persistent supply.

**Key Levels:** 29.95 (Recent Support), 34.31 (Recent High Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 27.95 (low of the last bar) on increased volume.
- **Invalidation:** 31.83 (Last weekly high)
---
### CBSH (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Weak Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
In a BULLISH_TREND context, the monthly chart signals SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The last two weekly bars show tight ranges and attempts to stabilize. The previous week (2026-01-19) showed a wide spread down and low close (CLV -0.85) on normal volume, suggesting a failed effort to rise. The latest bar attempts a rebound, closing moderately high (CLV 0.24) on slightly increased volume (RelVol 1.30), but the spread is narrow (1.72). This suggests weak demand stepping in, unable to push the price decisively higher against the existing supply overhead.

**Key Levels:** 51.56 (Local Support), 53.90 (Local Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 53.29 on high volume for bullish confirmation; break below 51.56 on volume for bearish continuation.
- **Invalidation:** 51.56
---
### CELC (NEUTRAL/BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result / Test for Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is a wide spread bar up (Spread 12.45), but closes near the low (CLV -0.75) on high volume (RelVol 1.09). This is a strong Effort No Result/Upthrust, suggesting heavy supply overwhelmed the buying effort near the highs ($120.31). This occurs in a context where the monthly chart shows a very wide range but an almost neutral close (CLV 0.001) on relatively low volume for the spread, suggesting significant two-sided action but ultimately failed upside follow-through.

**Key Levels:** 120.31 (Supply Zone/High), 107.86 (Local Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 107.86 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** 120.31
---
### CIVI (BEARISH (Wait for Confirmation))
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax / Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar has a wide spread (2.56) and closes near the middle (CLV -0.42). Crucially, the volume is massive (RelVol 4.44), likely representing a large institution entering or exiting. Given the previous week's BUYING_CLIMAX signal and negative CLV, this high volume down bar suggests significant distribution and potential capitulation/Selling Climax, confirming the potential for a larger downtrend reversal from the high volume up move (2026-01-05).

**Key Levels:** 26.63 (Local Support/Climax low), 29.20 (High Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Clear weakness (No Demand) on subsequent rally attempts or a break below 26.63.
- **Invalidation:** 29.20
---
### CMPO (NEUTRAL/BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Supply Absorption

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence shows a large effort bar (Week 2026-01-12, CLV 0.71, RelVol 3.54), followed by two weeks of decline, confirming the STOPPING_VOLUME/Distribution event. The last bar is a wide spread down (Spread 2.43), closing near the low (CLV -0.43) on decreasing volume (RelVol 1.47, high but less than prior weeks). This decline indicates that Smart Money allowed a correction. The low volume Test on the up bars (Week 2026-01-19) suggests institutional disinterest, but the last bar's high volume near the bottom could signal absorption, initiating the Test phase of the stopping volume context.

**Key Levels:** 22.88 (Low Support), 25.95 (High Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A definitive No Supply test or a strong reversal bar above 24.00.
- **Invalidation:** 22.00 (Break below 22.88)
---
### CNXC (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence showed possible stopping volume (Week 2026-01-12) on high volume but a good close (CLV 0.76). However, the subsequent price action failed to follow through. The last bar is a wide spread down (Spread 7.43), closing sharply near the low (CLV -0.63) on high volume (RelVol 1.19). This signals heavy distribution and a failed rally attempt, suggesting the prior 'Stopping Volume' was merely a temporary pause before continuation down in the broader monthly context (CLV -0.69).

**Key Levels:** 36.00 (New Low Support), 43.43 (Local Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 36.00 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** 43.43
---
### CORT (NEUTRAL/BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Effort to Rise

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly context has been extremely volatile (BUYING_CLIMAX followed by a collapse, CLV -0.93 in Dec). The current weekly chart shows a strong reversal attempt (Week 2026-01-19: wide up spread, CLV 0.84, on high volume). The latest bar is a wide spread (10.26) down bar, but it closed well off the low (CLV -0.40) on high volume (RelVol 1.66). This suggests significant buying absorbing the supply (Stopping Volume). This is a battle zone, but the ability to close mid-range after a major drop suggests demand is entering.

**Key Levels:** 36.80 (Support), 47.06 (High Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A narrow spread, low volume 'Test' bar or a confirmed break above 44.84.
- **Invalidation:** 36.79 (Break below signals further panic)
---
### CPNG (NEUTRAL/BULLISH (Anticipating Test))
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
Deep within a BEARISH_TREND and Monthly SUPPLY_DOMINANCE context, the last weekly bar is a wide spread bar (Spread 2.42), closing in the upper half (CLV 0.32) on extremely high volume (RelVol 2.56). This massive volume at the bottom of a downtrend with a close significantly off the low suggests heavy institutional buying (Selling Climax). Smart Money has absorbed supply. This signals an imminent change of character, but a Test is usually required.

**Key Levels:** 18.55 (Selling Climax Low), 20.97 (Local Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A low volume Test of the 18.55-20.00 area.
- **Invalidation:** 18.50 (Break below SC low)
---
### CRBG (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Weak Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stock is in a chop zone following a monthly BUYING_CLIMAX. The last bar is an up bar with a relatively tight spread (1.25) closing moderately high (CLV 0.41) on slightly below-average volume (RelVol 0.61). This suggests demand is present but not aggressive, struggling to overcome resistance near $31. The lack of decisive volume makes it difficult to commit to a strong bullish view, despite the positive close. Supply is still potentially active above.

**Key Levels:** 29.94 (Support), 31.20 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and hold above 31.20 on high volume.
- **Invalidation:** 29.35 (Break below prior swing low)
---
### CVS (NEUTRAL (Extreme Volatility))
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Selling Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is a monumental wide spread down (Spread 13.30), closing near the low (CLV -0.42) on huge volume (RelVol 2.24). This is likely a Selling Climax, representing major capitulation selling, particularly following a failed strong upthrust (Week 2026-01-19, CLV 0.90). The sharp breakdown, even if it is a SC, confirms the market is firmly in a SUPPLY_DOMINANCE phase. Needs a clear Test before any bullish entry is considered.

**Key Levels:** 70.69 (Selling Climax Low/Critical Support), 77.00 (Prior Low Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Confirmation of absorption (e.g., a tight spread, low volume test of 70.69).
- **Invalidation:** 70.00 (Break below the SC low)
---
### DOW (NEUTRAL/BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result

**Smart Money Logic:**
In a BULLISH_TREND, the price action has shown consistent attempts to rise, with generally positive closes. The last bar is a wide spread down (Spread 2.73), but closes well off the low (CLV 0.26) on high volume (RelVol 1.30). This suggests an Effort No Result: despite high volume, sellers pushed the price down significantly from the open, indicating strong supply is entering the market near $28.50. While the close is neutral, the heavy volume bar after an uptrend is concerning.

**Key Levels:** 27.50 (Local Support/Close), 28.56 (High Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 28.56 on volume for bullish continuation, or break below 27.50 on volume for short setup.
- **Invalidation:** 28.56
---
### FER (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Supply Encountered

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is an up bar with a moderate spread (2.79) closing slightly below the mid-point (CLV -0.30) on below-average volume (RelVol 0.70). The slight selling from the high ($69.81) suggests supply is present, resulting in an Effort No Result on the day, although the close is still positive from the prior week. The monthly chart shows high volume but a mid-range close (CLV 0.33), suggesting two-sided action. No clear immediate signal.

**Key Levels:** 67.02 (Local Support), 69.81 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 69.81 on increased volume for bullish setup.
- **Invalidation:** 67.02
---
### FFIV (NEUTRAL/BEARISH (Caution))
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Effort No Result

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is a massive wide spread bar (Spread 42.13) which closed well off its high (CLV -0.34) on high volume (RelVol 1.65). This is an extreme volatility event, likely associated with news or earnings. The enormous spread and failure to close high strongly suggests that significant distribution occurred at the high ($303.98), overpowering the effort to rise. This is a classic Buying Climax/Effort No Result signal, suggesting a reversal is likely, confirming the monthly STOPPING_VOLUME signal.

**Key Levels:** 261.85 (Support Low), 303.98 (Buying Climax High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Clear weakness (No Demand) on subsequent small rallies or a break below 261.85.
- **Invalidation:** 303.98
---
### FRPT (NEUTRAL/BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Encountered / Retracement

**Smart Money Logic:**
In a BULLISH_TREND, the prior week showed strong bullish momentum (CLV 0.69, high volume). The latest bar is a wide spread down (Spread 5.55), closing below the mid-point (CLV -0.25) on high volume (RelVol 1.15). This suggests profit-taking or supply entering the market after the swift rally. However, the close is well off the low, indicating some absorption/demand stepped in near $67.63. It's currently testing prior demand. Monthly context suggests consolidation after STOPPING_VOLUME.

**Key Levels:** 67.64 (Support), 73.19 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A definitive Test on low volume or a break above 73.19.
- **Invalidation:** 67.64
---
### GKOS (NEUTRAL/BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result / Supply Encountered

**Smart Money Logic:**
In a BULLISH_TREND, the monthly context signals BUYING_CLIMAX. The last weekly bar is a wide spread down (Spread 12.20), closing below the mid-point (CLV -0.54) on moderate volume (RelVol 0.82). This follows a wide-spread down bar the prior week (CLV -0.71). The consistent inability to maintain strength and the negative CLV readings, despite the uptrend, suggests that Smart Money is distributing into the recent high. The last bar confirms supply is dominant.

**Key Levels:** 116.63 (Local Support), 128.84 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 116.63 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** 121.45 (Last weekly open)
---
### HDB (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Absorption / Weak Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stock is in a BEARISH_TREND, recently confirming SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (Week 2026-01-05, CLV -0.90 on massive volume). The last two weeks have been narrow spread bars with minimal negative movement, suggesting the pace of selling has slowed significantly. The last bar is a narrow spread (0.61) up bar, closing near the middle (CLV 0.09) on high volume (RelVol 1.38). The high volume on a narrow up bar suggests absorption of supply, but the lack of a strong close indicates weak demand follow-through. A battle is occurring.

**Key Levels:** 32.04 (Support), 32.66 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and hold above 32.66 on confirming volume for bullish intent.
- **Invalidation:** 32.04
---
### HRMY (NEUTRAL/BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Encountered / Distribution

**Smart Money Logic:**
The recent weekly action shows volatility, with an attempted rally (Week 2026-01-19, CLV 0.47) followed by immediate failure. The last bar is a down bar (Spread 1.80) closing near the low (CLV -0.61) on normal volume (RelVol 0.62). This suggests distribution after a failed rally attempt, confirming the Monthly SUPPLY_DOMINANCE context. Supply is overwhelming demand near $37.00.

**Key Levels:** 36.17 (Local Support), 37.98 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 36.17 on increased volume.
- **Invalidation:** 37.98
---
### HUM (NEUTRAL (Extreme Volatility))
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Selling Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stock is in a BEARISH_TREND. The last weekly bar is extreme: a huge wide spread down (Spread 77.69), closing near the absolute low (CLV -0.90) on massive, climactic volume (RelVol 3.10). This indicates panic selling and likely marks a Selling Climax, potentially ending the current aggressive down phase. The monthly chart confirms this extreme distribution/capitulation with an extremely negative CLV (-0.91) on high volume.

**Key Levels:** 191.39 (Selling Climax Low/Critical Support), 269.09 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A definitive Test on low volume near 191.39 or a strong reversal bar next week.
- **Invalidation:** 190.00 (Break below SC low)
---
### IREN (NEUTRAL/BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Encountered / Distribution

**Smart Money Logic:**
Following a very strong run (Monthly CLV 0.22, suggesting recovery), the last weekly bar is a wide spread down (Spread 11.80), closing in the lower third (CLV -0.66) on high volume (RelVol 1.22). This suggests that after the steep rise, Smart Money initiated distribution. The high volume selling near the top of the recent range indicates a sharp reversal of momentum and suggests supply has reasserted control, confirming the Monthly SUPPLY_DOMINANCE context.

**Key Levels:** 51.78 (Local Support), 63.59 (Resistance/High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 51.78 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** 58.58 (Prior high)
---
### ITT (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Weak Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stock is in a BEARISH_TREND, but recent monthly action suggests absorption (CLV 0.28). The last weekly bar is an up bar with a wide spread (7.74), but it closes only slightly above the mid-point (CLV 0.09) on normal volume (RelVol 1.02). This is an Effort No Result on the upside, suggesting supply is capping the rally near $185.82, despite the institutional attempt to push the price higher. This indicates weakness in demand.

**Key Levels:** 182.30 (Close/Support), 185.82 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 185.82 on high volume for bullish intent.
- **Invalidation:** 180.89 (Prior low close)
---
### KDP (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Weak Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
In a BEARISH_TREND, the monthly context signals BUYING_CLIMAX watch. The last weekly bar is a moderate spread up bar (1.38), closing in the upper half (CLV 0.50) on moderate volume (RelVol 0.69). Despite the positive close, the relatively low volume and tight spread suggest weak demand, failing to decisively overcome the prior week's pressure. This points to consolidation in a low-conviction range.

**Key Levels:** 27.44 (Close/Support), 27.78 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Clear break above 27.78 on high volume.
- **Invalidation:** 26.39 (Local Support Low)
---
### KYMR (NEUTRAL / CAUTIOUS BULLISH (Short-Term))
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Monthly) / Wide Spread Up with High Volume (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stock is in a Quarterly BULLISH_TREND. The recent Monthly bar was a wide up spread with high volume, closing mid-range (CLV 0.10). This confirms the prior month's BUYING_CLIMAX warning, suggesting potential distribution starting. The last weekly bar was a large spread up on high volume (RelVol 0.86), closing near the high (CLV 0.47), suggesting effort is being met with some result, but given the monthly context, this is likely effort to sustain the rally rather than initiate a new one. Smart Money is likely liquidating into strength.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 77.93 (Monthly High), Support: 66.21 (Monthly Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a clear No Demand/Test action below 70.00 or a reversal confirmation above 78.00.
- **Invalidation:** 77.93 (If cleared convincingly, the monthly supply failed)
---
### LQDA (NEUTRAL / CAUTIOUS)
**VSA Status:** Effort to Rise / Monthly Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart shows CONFIRMED_EARLY SUPPLY_DOMINANCE, suggesting institutional selling, despite the Quarterly BULLISH_TREND. The last weekly bar showed moderate volume (RelVol 0.88), a mid-range close (CLV 0.17), and a large spread up from the open. This represents effort to push higher, but without confirming relative volume surge or a strong close, it's ambiguous. It is likely still grinding against monthly supply.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 44.27 (Weekly High/Potential Supply Zone), Support: 39.71 (Last week low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a clear weekly thrust above 44.27 or a decisive failure below 39.71.
- **Invalidation:** 37.00 (Loss of stability from earlier weeks)
---
### NFXL (NEUTRAL / CAUTIOUS BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Weekly Confirmed)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly chart detected STOPPING_VOLUME previously, and the last two weeks show mixed but high-volume action. The bar two weeks ago had extreme volume (RelVol 3.33) but closed mid-range (CLV -0.006), suggesting supply was met by absorption (Stopping Volume). The last bar was a wide spread down on high volume (RelVol 1.45), but not extreme, closing mid/low (CLV -0.53). This pullback is likely a test of the prior demand, but the low CLV is concerning. Needs more confirmation.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 27.96 (Prior swing high), Support: 23.15 (Stopping Volume Low), Recent Low: 23.33

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a clean Test (No Supply) off 23.33 or a strong reversal bar.
- **Invalidation:** 23.15 (If broken, stopping action has failed)
---
### OC (NEUTRAL / CAUTIOUS)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result / Monthly Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly chart indicates STOPPING_VOLUME. The last weekly bar was a wide spread down on high volume (RelVol 1.10), closing near the low (CLV -0.29). While the volume is high, the spread is wide down, indicating strong profit-taking or supply distribution after the recent uptrend. This is a potential Sign of Weakness (SOW) within the bullish Quarterly Trend.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 125.30 (Weekly High), Immediate Support: 116.88 (Weekly Low), Major Support: 110.00 (Monthly Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a successful test of 116.88 (No Supply) or a break below 110.00.
- **Invalidation:** 126.92 (If price clears recent highs and sustains)
---
### ONB (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Effort to Rise (Weak CLV)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Monthly SUPPLY_DOMINANCE is CONFIRMED_EARLY. The last weekly bar was an up bar with moderate spread and volume (RelVol 0.83), closing near the high (CLV 0.82). This shows temporary effort to hold the price up, but given the overarching supply context and general market weakness (SPY DOWN), this move may be transient. The market is attempting to shake off supply.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 24.78 (Weekly High), Support: 23.37 (Last week low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a test (No Supply) near 23.50 or a breakout above 24.78.
- **Invalidation:** 23.00 (Loss of recent stability)
---
### OZK (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Weekly Confirmed)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Despite the BULLISH Quarterly Trend, the last two weekly bars show strong supply action. Two weeks ago, a wide spread down on high volume (RelVol 2.05) closed near the low (CLV -0.91), signaling a Sign of Weakness (SOW). The last bar was an up bar on high volume (RelVol 1.13), closing high (CLV 0.70), potentially indicating demand absorbing the prior supply. However, the selling pressure from the prior SOW is massive. This week's demand looks like a possible retracement/weak rally into supply.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 47.90 (Last week high), Supply Zone: 48.00 - 49.70, Support: 45.64

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Failure/No Demand confirmed below 48.00, or a decisive break above 49.69.
- **Invalidation:** 49.69 (Clearance of high volume supply zone)
---
### PSN (NEUTRAL / CAUTIOUS BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result / Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Trend is BEARISH, and the Monthly Sequence warns of SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The last weekly bar was a wide down spread on moderate volume (RelVol 0.86), closing mid-range (CLV -0.57). This suggests supply is active, pushing the price down from the open, following a rejection from 74.63. The high volume week previously (RelVol 1.40) resulted in a massive up bar, but the market failed to sustain the move.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 74.63 (Recent high), Immediate Support: 69.18 (Last week low), Major Support: 61.56 (Monthly Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below 69.18 on high volume.
- **Invalidation:** 73.26 (If price recovers above last week's open/high)
---
### PTGX (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Monthly Buying Climax / Ambiguous Weekly

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart detected a BUYING_CLIMAX. The last weekly bar was a wide spread up on moderate volume (RelVol 0.76), closing mid-range (CLV 0.24). This is mild effort without convincing result, suggesting price is struggling to find follow-through after the initial markdown from 87.53 (two weeks ago). The market is consolidating under supply after a large volume down-bar (CLV -0.75).

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 84.32 (Last week high), Immediate Support: 77.69 (Last week low), Major Support: 79.18

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Breakout above 84.32 on high volume, or breakdown below 77.69.
- **Invalidation:** 77.69 (If this support is lost, the short bias prevails)
---
### QQQI (NEUTRAL / CAUTIOUS BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Monthly) / Effort No Result

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart warns of a BUYING_CLIMAX. The last weekly bar had a moderate spread up on high volume (RelVol 1.11), but closed mid-range (CLV -0.51). This high volume with a weak close is typical of Effort No Result or institutional selling (supply absorbing demand) near a potential market high. Given the market context, this points to smart money distribution.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 54.67 (Weekly High), Immediate Support: 53.56 (Weekly Low), Major Support: 52.78 (Monthly Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below 53.56 on high volume, confirming supply.
- **Invalidation:** 54.67 (If price clears the top of the distribution bar)
---
### RF (NEUTRAL / CAUTIOUS)
**VSA Status:** Effort to Rise (Weak CLV) / Monthly Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart warns of SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The last weekly bar was an up bar with moderate spread, closing high (CLV 0.76) on moderate volume (RelVol 0.77). This shows demand is active, pushing the price towards resistance. However, the overall monthly structure suggests this is a reaction rally into institutional selling pressure. Needs to overcome prior weekly supply.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 28.99 (Prior swing high), Immediate Support: 27.25 (Last week low), Monthly Low: 26.81

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close above 29.00 on surging volume, or failure/rejection at 28.67.
- **Invalidation:** 27.25 (If lost, supply is still controlling)
---
### RLI (NEUTRAL / CAUTIOUS BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Monthly Buying Climax / Ambiguous Weekly

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Trend is BEARISH, but the Monthly sequence flags a BUYING_CLIMAX. The last weekly bar was a moderate spread up on high volume (RelVol 1.57), closing mid-range (CLV 0.19). High volume on an up bar with a poor close suggests supply is meeting the effort (Effort No Result). This is often an institutional shakeout or short covering rally into resistance.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 59.45 (Last week high), Immediate Support: 56.91 (Last week low), Major Resistance: 63.19

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Rejection/No Demand below 60.00, or a break above 60.35 on sustained volume.
- **Invalidation:** 60.35 (Clearance of prior week's high)
---
### RTO (NEUTRAL / CAUTIOUS BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Weekly Confirmed) / Effort No Result

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly chart flagged STOPPING_VOLUME. The last weekly bar was a wide spread down on moderate volume (RelVol 1.35), closing near the low (CLV -0.78). This bar sharply reverses the momentum from the prior week (which was a strong up bar with high CLV). This strong reversal suggests supply has quickly entered the market, likely profiting taking or a shakeout against the prior rally. However, it lands back into the potential accumulation zone identified by the prior Stopping Volume.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 33.46 (Weekly High), Immediate Support: 31.28 (Weekly Low), Major Support: 30.62

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a No Supply test of 31.28 or a confirmed move back above 33.00.
- **Invalidation:** 31.28 (If broken, stopping action is failing)
---
### RVMD (NEUTRAL / CAUTIOUS BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Monthly Buying Climax / Shakeout / Effort No Result

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart detected a massive BUYING_CLIMAX. The last weekly bar was a wide down spread on high volume (RelVol 1.49), closing mid-range (CLV -0.05). This is a strong shakeout bar following the massive rally weeks prior (RelVol 4.20). The high volume suggests institutional selling meeting opportunistic buying. The wide spread down from the open is bearish, but the mid-range close suggests some buying supported the price off the lows (92.50).

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 101.93 (Last week high), Immediate Support: 92.50 (Last week low), Major Support: 76.28 (Monthly Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Clear recovery and close above 102.00, or breakdown below 92.50.
- **Invalidation:** 92.50 (If broken, confirms continuation of markdown)
---
### RYN (NEUTRAL / CAUTIOUS BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Weekly Confirmed) / Shakeout

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly chart flagged STOPPING_VOLUME. The last bar was a wide spread down on extremely high volume (RelVol 2.70), closing mid/low (CLV -0.20). The high volume spike suggests a significant shakeout or institutional absorption of supply near the 21.89 low, following the previous buying climax warning. This bar could be terminal supply or a final shakeout before a markup.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 24.82 (Recent high), Immediate Support: 21.90 (Shakeout Low), Accumulation Zone: 21.50 - 22.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a No Supply test near 22.00 or a strong close above 24.00.
- **Invalidation:** 21.90 (If broken, the stopping action failed)
---
### STAA (NEUTRAL / CAUTIOUS BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Weekly Confirmed) / Weakness

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence flagged CONFIRMED_EARLY STOPPING_VOLUME, suggesting accumulation potential. However, the last two bars show weakness. The previous bar was a wide spread down on moderate volume (CLV -0.92), confirming supply. The last bar was a narrow spread down on below-average volume (RelVol 0.75), closing mid/low (CLV -0.42). This suggests the Stopping Volume lacked follow-through and supply remains dominant, pushing price lower on lighter volume.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 19.66 (Last week high), Accumulation Low: 18.66, Major Resistance: 22.68

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below 18.66, confirming SV failure.
- **Invalidation:** 20.97 (If price recovers the low of the prior consolidation)
---
### TRU (NEUTRAL / CAUTIOUS BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Monthly Stopping Volume / Weekly Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart confirmed STOPPING_VOLUME. However, the last weekly bar showed a wide spread down on moderate volume (RelVol 0.85), closing near the low (CLV -0.87). This suggests supply immediately followed the prior accumulation attempt. This sharp reversal negates the prior two weeks of recovery, indicating that the institutional buying (SV) lacks immediate follow-through, and price is being marked down again.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 85.14 (Last week high), Immediate Support: 78.60 (New Low), Major Support: 81.08 (SV zone)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below 78.60, indicating failure of the monthly SV.
- **Invalidation:** 84.16 (Recovery above the distribution bar's open)
---
### UGI (NEUTRAL / CAUTIOUS BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Weekly Confirmed) / Effort No Result

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Weekly chart flagged a BUYING_CLIMAX (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The last bar was a wide spread up on extreme volume (RelVol 2.19), but closed mid-range (CLV -0.02). This is classic Effort No Result or institutional distribution/selling into strength. The volume is exceptionally high, indicating Smart Money is liquidating into the excitement generated by the spike to 41.34.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 41.34 (BC High), Immediate Support: 38.95 (Weekly Low), Major Support: 37.07

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below 38.95 on sustained volume, confirming supply.
- **Invalidation:** 41.34 (If price manages to clear and hold this high)
---
### USIG (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Weekly) / Low Volatility

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence flagged SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The price action is extremely tight. The last bar was a narrow spread down on moderate volume (RelVol 1.03), closing mid/low (CLV -0.25). In this low volatility environment, any sign of high volume selling is notable, but the price range is minimal. The last three weeks suggest increasing volume without increasing spread, indicating supply absorption or slow distribution.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 52.11 (Recent High), Immediate Support: 51.87 (Last week low), Major Support: 51.65

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Breakout above 52.12 or breakdown below 51.65 on high volume.
- **Invalidation:** 51.65 (Loss of range support)
---
### VONG (NEUTRAL / CAUTIOUS BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Weekly) / Stopping Volume (Monthly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart flagged STOPPING_VOLUME, suggesting a potential bottom, but the Quarterly Trend is BEARISH. The weekly sequence flagged SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The last weekly bar was a wide spread down on moderate volume (RelVol 1.28), closing mid/low (CLV -0.28). This suggests continued supply, overriding the monthly accumulation context. The price is failing to find demand after hitting lows at 118.66.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 122.50 (Last week high), Immediate Support: 118.66 (New Low), Major Resistance: 123.18

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below 118.66, invalidating SV possibility.
- **Invalidation:** 120.94 (Recovery above prior week's high)
---
### ZM (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Monthly Buying Climax / Ambiguous Weekly

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart warns of a BUYING_CLIMAX. The last weekly bar was a wide spread up on very high volume (RelVol 1.99), closing mid-range (CLV 0.019). High volume on a wide spread up with a weak close is classic Effort No Result, suggesting heavy supply is meeting the institutional demand at the highs (near 97.58). This usually signals distribution is taking place near a peak.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 97.58 (BC High), Immediate Support: 86.40 (Weekly Low), Prior Resistance: 85.94

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Decisive break above 97.58, or breakdown below 86.40 on high volume.
- **Invalidation:** 86.40 (If broken, supply is confirmed to be stronger)
---
