## 🚀 Ready for Entry
### BAH (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
After a sustained bearish move, the last week shows a significant surge in volume (1.58 RelVol) with a high CLV (0.62), suggesting smart money is absorbing supply at these lower levels. The reversal off the 73.93 low is a classic sign of preliminary support.

**Key Levels:** 73.93, 80.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 80.00 with high volume
- **Invalidation:** 73.90
---
### BBT (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Upthrust

**Smart Money Logic:**
Last week's high volume (1.5 RelVol) coupled with a low CLV (-0.60) after hitting $32 indicates a clear rejection of higher prices. This is a classic 'Upthrust' into supply, suggesting a reversal to the downside.

**Key Levels:** 29.19, 32.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Breach of 29.19 low
- **Invalidation:** 32.10
---
### BCE (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Professional Support

**Smart Money Logic:**
Despite the supply dominance tag, the last weekly bar shows a high CLV (0.78) on high relative volume (1.14), indicating professional buying near the 25.55 level. This suggests an accumulation phase or a short-term rally.

**Key Levels:** 25.55, 26.40

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break of 26.40
- **Invalidation:** 25.50
---
### BEP (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
Relative volume is high (1.1) but the spread is narrowing significantly. This indicates that supply is drying up as the price holds near 31.78. A successful test here would precede a move higher.

**Key Levels:** 31.26, 32.58

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Price exceeding 32.60
- **Invalidation:** 31.20
---
### BFAM (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
Massive volume (1.84 RelVol) on a recovery week with a high CLV (0.62) suggests professional 'bag holding' or absorption of the preceding sharp sell-off. The climax has likely passed, and a base is forming.

**Key Levels:** 63.68, 75.45

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break of 75.50
- **Invalidation:** 63.60
---
### BHP (BULLISH)

- **Invalidation:** 76.80

### CBRE (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

- **Entry Trigger:** High volume break of 151.00
- **Invalidation:** 143.00

### CBSH (BEARISH)

- **Invalidation:** 19.20

---
### COHR (BULLISH)

- **Entry Trigger:** Break of 25.60
- **Invalidation:** 30.10
---
### CSGP (BEARISH)

- **Invalidation:** 50.10
---

- **Invalidation:** 24.30
---
### DOCU (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**

- **Invalidation:** 40.15
---
### DUOL (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Massive volume (RelVol 4.14) resulted in a lower close and wide spread. While there is some CLV (-0.33), the sheer force of supply at 112.00 suggests professional distribution is still active.

**Key Levels:** 91.99, 101.00, 119.14

- **Entry Trigger:** Rejection of 110.00 on low volume
- **Invalidation:** 119.15

### ELS (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Supply at Highs

**Smart Money Logic:**

- **Entry Trigger:** Price must clear 68.60 on high volume to negate supply
- **Invalidation:** 65.00

### ENR (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** End of Rising Market

- **Invalidation:** 260.00

- **Invalidation:** 57.70
---
### FOXA (NEUTRAL)

### FTAI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

### GPN (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result

- **Invalidation:** 82.00

---
### MAT (BEARISH)

### MSFU (NEUTRAL)

---
### NET (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

### PB (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**

- **Invalidation:** 43.12

### PRU (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Smart money is selling the rallies. The high volume down-move to 98 and the inability to bounce (CLV -0.71) indicates further downside potential.

**Key Levels:** 97.46, 98.38, 112.49

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** None
- **Invalidation:** 103.38
---
### PSN (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** No Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
Price is drifting sideways with decreasing spread and volume. This is 'No Supply' but also 'No Demand'. We need an effort bar to signal the next move.

**Key Levels:** 59.13, 66.00, 70.61

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wide spread up bar on high volume
- **Invalidation:** 63.81
---
### PTC (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
High volume absorption is occurring at 147-150. However, the rallies have low CLV. Smart money is supporting, but not yet ready to push.

**Key Levels:** 146.72, 156.59, 162.93

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Low volume test of 148.00
- **Invalidation:** 146.00
---
### QQQI (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
Low spreads and low relative volume suggest smart money is sitting on the sidelines. The current market context is sideways, mirroring the SPY.

**Key Levels:** 51.11, 52.43, 54.35

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** High volume wide spread bar
- **Invalidation:** 51.10
---
### QTWO (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
A huge volume spike on the most recent week with price failing to rally (CLV -0.10). This indicates selling pressure is still being absorbed. Patience required.

**Key Levels:** 46.16, 48.12, 62.31

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A secondary test on low volume
- **Invalidation:** 46.10
---
### RARE (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** No Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
Volume is drying up at current levels (RelVol 0.83). Smart money is not selling, but they aren't buying aggressively either.

**Key Levels:** 19.60, 23.39, 25.82

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Rising volume breakout above 24.70
- **Invalidation:** 22.39
---
### RF (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The latest move is a wide spread down bar on high volume, closing near the low (CLV -0.82). This confirms professional distribution.

**Key Levels:** 27.60, 27.83, 31.53

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** None
- **Invalidation:** 30.16
---
### RGTI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
Price is struggling to maintain rallies. CLV is low, and RelVol is mediocre. The smart money is not interested in supporting this ticker currently.

**Key Levels:** 14.78, 17.42, 23.78

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** None
- **Invalidation:** 19.21
---
### RKT (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Despite high volume (RelVol 1.32), the price close was weak. This suggests a 'Squat' bar where selling is overcoming the buy attempts.

**Key Levels:** 16.58, 18.19, 21.37

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** None
- **Invalidation:** 18.49
---
### RTO (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
Absorption is taking place at 30.00. The latest bar closed mid-range on high volume. We need to see price hold 31.00 as new support.

**Key Levels:** 30.04, 31.28, 33.46

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Low volume pullback to 30.50
- **Invalidation:** 30.00
---
### RYAAY (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
Price is stabilizing after a drop. High volume at the lows of 64.00, but CLV is still weak (0.20). Market is waiting for a 'Test' bar.

**Key Levels:** 63.83, 67.49, 71.36

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Narrow spread bar on low volume
- **Invalidation:** 64.00
---
### RYN (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
A high volume bar that closed near its low (CLV -0.22) breaking local support levels. Supply is very much in control here.

**Key Levels:** 20.75, 21.49, 23.79

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** None
- **Invalidation:** 22.65
---
### SARO (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Extreme high volume on the latest bar (RelVol 2.70) with a low close. This is institutional distribution and a high probability sign of further weakness.

**Key Levels:** 28.63, 30.80, 33.26

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** None
- **Invalidation:** 31.68
---
### SATS (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** No Supply Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
Volume has dried up significantly since the climax. Price is holding steady near 115, but we lack the 'Effort' bar needed to confirm a new leg up.

**Key Levels:** 104.63, 115.53, 132.25

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 123.00 with volume expansion
- **Invalidation:** 109.00
---
### SSNC (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Test in a Downtrend

**Smart Money Logic:**
Despite high RelVol (1.78), the quarterly context is bearish. The recovery from 69.00 lacks sufficient spread to confirm a trend reversal, suggesting this is a temporary bounce into overhead supply.

**Key Levels:** 69.00, 76.02, 81.89

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Failure to hold 75.00 followed by a breakdown
- **Invalidation:** 77.11
---
### SUPN (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
A massive spread increase (10.05) on high RelVol (2.20) suggests a blow-off top. While bullish in the long term, the low CLV (0.01) indicates supply entered heavily at the 59.68 peak.

**Key Levels:** 49.63, 54.73, 59.68

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Waiting for a low-volume test of 50.00
- **Invalidation:** 49.00
---
### SYF (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Price is falling on high RelVol (1.62) with a very low CLV (-0.72). This shows professional selling (distribution) and no signs of stopping volume yet.

**Key Levels:** 68.20, 73.37, 75.83

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short on weak rally to 71.50
- **Invalidation:** 74.81
---
### TROW (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Monthly spread is widening on the downside with RelVol 1.52. The weekly close near the middle of the range on high volume suggests effort but no result for buyers.

**Key Levels:** 91.70, 94.63, 107.21

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 92.00
- **Invalidation:** 97.67
---
### TXT (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is bullish, but the recent rally is stalling. Narrow spread and low CLV (0.16) on average volume suggest buyers are exhausted and a pullback is coming.

**Key Levels:** 95.67, 98.65, 101.57

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Successful test of 94.00 on low volume
- **Invalidation:** 101.60
---
### UGI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax Failure

**Smart Money Logic:**
RelVol 2.19 on the up-move in late Jan failed to hold gains. Current volume is average but the trend is down, indicating that the supply from the climax has not been absorbed.

**Key Levels:** 36.77, 37.41, 41.34

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 36.70
- **Invalidation:** 39.00
---
### VNO (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
VNO is falling with increasing spreads and RelVol (1.52). The ultra-low CLV (-0.86 and -0.95) shows aggressive professional selling with no bottom in sight.

**Key Levels:** 27.45, 29.07, 32.98

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short on a low-volume retracement to 29.50
- **Invalidation:** 30.14
---
### VNT (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result (Bearish)

**Smart Money Logic:**
High monthly RelVol (1.47) resulted in a small candle and negative CLV. This indicates that professional supply is preventing the quarterly bullish trend from progressing.

**Key Levels:** 37.22, 40.92, 48.20

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for 42.00 breakout or 37.00 failure
- **Invalidation:** 38.80
---
### VONG (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
High volume selling is persistent. The RelVol of 2.14 on a down-close with negative CLV suggests that the smart money is unloading growth shares.

**Key Levels:** 113.96, 115.87, 120.78

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 114.00
- **Invalidation:** 118.10
---
### WAL (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Distribution

**Smart Money Logic:**
A massive increase in spread (13.68) on very high RelVol (2.08) with a near-zero CLV (-0.92) signals aggressive professional selling. The quarterly trend is bearish, confirming the move.

**Key Levels:** 79.79, 80.32, 93.47

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 79.50
- **Invalidation:** 91.37
---
### WGMI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
Rallies are occurring on very low relative volume (0.38 - 0.68), which is a sign of 'No Demand' from professional operators. Lower prices are likely.

**Key Levels:** 34.99, 39.88, 46.62

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 37.60
- **Invalidation:** 41.47
---
### WHR (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Capitulation

**Smart Money Logic:**
Extreme RelVol (4.13) on a massive down bar. While this can sometimes be capitulation, the extremely low CLV (-0.82) suggests that supply is still overwhelmed by demand.

**Key Levels:** 66.85, 68.43, 84.49

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short on rally to 75.00 if volume is low
- **Invalidation:** 83.40
---
### WMG (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
Smart money support is visible on the monthly RelVol (1.61). The recent weekly shakeout to 26.75 met with absorption, though volume needs to increase on the up-move.

**Key Levels:** 26.25, 28.60, 31.19

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break of 30.13 with high volume
- **Invalidation:** 26.75
---
### WTRG (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result (Bearish)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Extremely high RelVol (5.45) on a narrow spread weekly bar is a major warning. This indicates that professional supply is being dumped into retail demand.

**Key Levels:** 36.37, 39.97, 40.88

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 38.65
- **Invalidation:** 40.90
---
### XYL (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
High volume selling in early Feb (RelVol 2.46) has not been countered. The current recovery is weak on high volume (RelVol 1.63), suggesting sellers are still present.

**Key Levels:** 123.98, 129.56, 142.97

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 126.42
- **Invalidation:** 131.95
---
### ZETA (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result / Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
While RelVol is high (2.04), the CLV is very low (0.14), meaning the stock sold off significantly from its weekly highs. Supply is dominating the 18.00+ zone.

**Key Levels:** 14.53, 16.95, 18.65

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Low volume test of 15.00
- **Invalidation:** 18.70
---
### ZM (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
A sudden surge in RelVol (3.00) on a wide spread down (17.85) with a very low CLV (-0.85) suggests institutional liquidation. This is a very bearish sign.

**Key Levels:** 72.69, 73.94, 96.52

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short on rally to 80.00
- **Invalidation:** 89.50
