## 🚀 Ready for Entry
### AIG (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply / Sign of Strength (SoS)

**Smart Money Logic:**
After the extreme volume down thrusts of early January, the last weekly bar (01/26) provided a clear No Supply signal: low volume (RelVol 0.57) on a narrow bar closing strongly positive (CLV 0.73). This suggests supply is temporarily exhausted, and Smart Money is preparing for a short-term upward movement within the accumulation base established near $72.

**Key Levels:** Support (Accumulation Base): $72.11, Resistance: $76.04

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $75.50
- **Invalidation:** $72.11
---
### ALC (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply / Accumulation Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
ALC showed base building characteristics throughout January. The last bar (01/26) is a low volume, narrow spread bar closing near the high (No Supply, RelVol 0.46, CLV 0.66). This suggests that Smart Money is finished absorbing and supply has vanished, confirming the base is ready for a breakout into the mark-up phase, supported by the bullish quarterly trend.

**Key Levels:** Support: $76.74, Resistance: $82.50

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close above $81.50
- **Invalidation:** $79.80
---
### AMBA (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Demand / Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
AMBA suffered a major supply injection on 01/05. The last bar (01/26) is a low volume, wide-ish down bar closing negatively (CLV -0.21, RelVol 0.47), indicating a 'No Demand' scenario. Professionals are likely ready to push prices lower, confirming the bearish quarterly trend.

**Key Levels:** Support: $63.85, Resistance: $69.05

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close below $65.23
- **Invalidation:** $69.05
---
### ARE (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Up-Thrust After Climax / Supply Entry

**Smart Money Logic:**
The strong bullish run was met with decisive supply pressure on 01/26. The wide down bar closed extremely poorly (CLV -0.72) on high volume (RelVol 1.13), confirming Smart Money distribution at the highs near $60. This is a clear sign of reversal and potential distribution underway.

**Key Levels:** Support: $53.15, Resistance: $59.76

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close below $53.15
- **Invalidation:** $59.76
---
### ARWR (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply / Test Confirmed

**Smart Money Logic:**
Following a Selling Climax (01/05) and subsequent high volume supply entry, the last bar (01/26) delivered a definitive No Supply signal (RelVol 0.58, CLV 0.66). The market tested for supply and found none, indicating that the base is set for a breakout, aligning with the bullish quarterly trend.

**Key Levels:** Support (SC Low): $60.61, Immediate Resistance: $71.40

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close above $70.00
- **Invalidation:** $65.45
---
### AVAV (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Weakness Confirmed / Distribution

**Smart Money Logic:**
AVAV experienced a clear Buying Climax on 01/05, immediately followed by severe selling (01/19). The 01/26 bar continues the markdown, closing poorly on average volume. This sequence confirms that Smart Money successfully distributed into the prior strength, initiating a new bearish phase.

**Key Levels:** Support: $288.30, Resistance: $408.25

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close below $288.30
- **Invalidation:** $321.04
---
### AXTI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Distribution / Weakness Confirmed

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Buying Climax on 01/05 marked the beginning of distribution. Subsequent weeks (01/12, 01/19, 01/26) showed overwhelming supply, confirmed by high volume and poor closes. The monthly bar closed extremely bearishly (CLV -0.70), negating the bullish quarterly context. Expect further markdown.

**Key Levels:** Support: $15.85, Resistance: $19.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close below $15.85
- **Invalidation:** $19.00
---
### BAH (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Up-Thrust After Climax / Supply Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The rally encountered significant distribution (Effort No Result Up on 01/19) followed by a definitive sign of weakness on 01/26. The extreme wide down bar closed near its low on extreme volume, confirming aggressive Smart Money selling and a high probability of a sustained markdown phase.

**Key Levels:** Support: $88.25, Resistance: $109.09

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close below $88.25
- **Invalidation:** $103.00
---
### BANC (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Weakness Confirmed / No Demand Rally

**Smart Money Logic:**
The decisive down-thrust on 01/19 confirmed supply dominance following a major Buying Climax. The subsequent low volume bounce (01/26) serves as a No Demand bar, suggesting that the recent sell-off will continue as there is no institutional support for higher prices.

**Key Levels:** Support: $19.67, Resistance: $20.40

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close below $19.67
- **Invalidation:** $20.40
---
### BBIO (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply / Accumulation Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The high volume on 01/12 signaled significant absorption (Stopping Volume). The resulting price action showed consolidation, culminating in a strong No Supply bar on 01/26 (low volume, strong close). This sequence confirms institutional accumulation is complete, supporting the bullish quarterly trend and signaling readiness for a move toward $81+.

**Key Levels:** Support (Accumulation Low): $70.95, Resistance: $81.32

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close above $80.00
- **Invalidation:** $75.83
---
### BBT (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Sign of Strength / No Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
Despite encountering supply on 01/19, the last weekly bar (01/26) demonstrated a clear Sign of Strength/No Supply (low volume, strong close near high, CLV 0.95). This suggests that the prior supply was absorbed and the bullish quarterly trend remains intact, setting the stage for a breakout above $29.62.

**Key Levels:** Support: $27.71, Resistance: $29.62

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close above $29.62 on high volume
- **Invalidation:** $27.71
---
### BBWI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Weakness / No Demand Down Move

**Smart Money Logic:**
The failure to hold recent highs culminated in a wide down bar on 01/26, closing near its low on conspicuously low volume (RelVol 0.48). This confirms a critical lack of institutional demand, allowing sellers to easily mark the price down, supporting the monthly Supply Dominance signal.

**Key Levels:** Support: $20.60, Resistance: $22.11

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close below $20.60
- **Invalidation:** $22.11
---
### BFH (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Sign of Strength (SoS) / Re-accumulation

**Smart Money Logic:**
After a brief but sharp shakeout (01/19), the market showed extreme resilience with a wide-spread up bar closing near the high (CLV 0.78) on high volume (RelVol 0.99). This confirms immediate re-accumulation by Smart Money and signals a likely continuation of the bullish quarterly trend once the price breaks $74.

**Key Levels:** Support (Accumulation Low): $67.78, Resistance: $74.16

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close above $74.16
- **Invalidation:** $68.56
---
### BKKT (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Weakness Confirmed / No Demand Down

**Smart Money Logic:**
Following a sharp speculative rally and subsequent distribution (01/19 rejection), the price confirms weakness on 01/26. The wide down bar on extremely low volume (RelVol 0.45, CLV -0.75) signals a decisive lack of demand, allowing the price to easily drop further, reinforcing the bearish quarterly trend.

**Key Levels:** Support: $13.35, Resistance: $15.61

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close below $13.35
- **Invalidation:** $15.61
---
### BNS (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Sign of Strength (SoS) / No Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
After absorbing supply on 01/05, BNS showed consecutive weeks of strength (01/19, 01/26) closing near the high on below-average volume. This clear No Supply confirmation suggests Smart Money is firmly in control and preparing for a breakout above $76.56, supporting the bullish quarterly trend.

**Key Levels:** Support: $71.63, Resistance: $76.56

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close above $76.56 on volume
- **Invalidation:** $74.70
---
### BRBR (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Weakness Confirmed / Failed Accumulation Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
Despite early January showing Stopping Volume/accumulation attempts, the effort failed decisively on 01/26. The wide down bar closed very negatively on high volume, indicating a return of significant supply and neutralizing the prior demand signals. This suggests continuation of the bearish quarterly trend.

**Key Levels:** Support: $24.64, Resistance: $27.11

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close below $24.64
- **Invalidation:** $27.11

### BRKR (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Weakness Confirmed / Markdown

**Smart Money Logic:**
The rally attempt was violently reversed on 01/12 by heavy supply. The 01/26 bar solidified this bearish stance with a wide down bar closing near its low (CLV -0.84), confirming sustained supply dominance and aligning with the bearish quarterly context. Expect further downside to test prior lows.

**Key Levels:** Support: $43.71, Resistance: $50.49

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close below $43.71
- **Invalidation:** $50.49
---
### BRZE (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Weakness Confirmed / Failed Reaction Rally

**Smart Money Logic:**
The price action confirms heavy markdown (01/12 SC). Despite a reaction attempt (01/19), the 01/26 bar showed a wide down spread closing near the low on high volume, indicating renewed aggressive selling and confirmation that supply remains dominant, aligning with the bearish quarterly context.

**Key Levels:** Support: $21.41, Resistance: $26.13

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close below $21.41
- **Invalidation:** $26.13
---
### BSY (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Weakness Confirmed / Supply Persistence

**Smart Money Logic:**
The rally attempt failed decisively, capped by the poor close on 01/12. The 01/26 bar confirmed weakness with a wide down spread closing near the low (CLV -0.74) on average volume. This indicates sustained supply pressure aligning with the bearish quarterly trend and monthly supply dominance.

**Key Levels:** Support: $34.49, Resistance: $38.89

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close below $34.49
- **Invalidation:** $38.89
---
### BWIN (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Weakness Confirmed / Supply Persistence

**Smart Money Logic:**
The price failed to sustain the mid-January rally, facing strong supply on 01/19. The 01/26 bar solidified this bearish shift with a wide down spread closing near the low (CLV -0.71) on average volume. This confirms the dominance of supply pressure and continuation of the bearish quarterly trend.

**Key Levels:** Support: $22.33, Resistance: $25.85

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close below $22.33
- **Invalidation:** $25.85
---
### CADE (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Weakness Confirmed / No Demand Rally

**Smart Money Logic:**
The market established strong supply dominance with the major down-thrust on 01/19 (CLV -0.98). The small rebound on 01/26 occurred on low volume (RelVol 0.76), classifying it as a No Demand bounce. This suggests the market lacks institutional support and is ready for markdown continuation.

**Key Levels:** Support: $41.60, Resistance: $43.40

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close below $41.60
- **Invalidation:** $43.40
---
### CALX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Major Supply / Weakness Confirmed

**Smart Money Logic:**
The rally attempt failed violently (01/19 rejection). The 01/26 bar delivered a catastrophic down-thrust on extreme volume (RelVol 2.26) closing at CLV -0.71. This confirms aggressive Smart Money distribution and markdown continuation, invalidating any recent bullish accumulation theories.

**Key Levels:** Support: $44.86, Resistance: $57.32

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close below $44.86
- **Invalidation:** $57.32
---
### CBRL (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Weakness Confirmed / No Demand Down

**Smart Money Logic:**
The failure of the upward effort (01/12) was followed by two consecutive weeks confirming supply dominance. The 01/26 bar, closing at the absolute low (CLV -0.97) on below-average volume, indicates a decisive lack of demand and confirmation of the markdown phase, aligning with the bearish quarterly trend.

**Key Levels:** Support: $28.39, Resistance: $31.83

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close below $28.39
- **Invalidation:** $31.83
---
### CELC (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Monthly) followed by a weak close on high volume.

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly bar (2026-01-01) closed strong but had high volume (1.17 RelVol) and a significant spread, confirming demand. However, the last weekly bar (2026-01-26) shows high volume (0.97 RelVol) but a wide spread down and a poor close (CLV -0.38), indicating aggressive supply entering the market right off the high of the week ($120.31). This looks like an upthrust or distribution attempt.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 120.31 (Recent High), Support: 108.50 (Last Weekly Open)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $112.00 (mid-range of supply bar) on elevated volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above $120.31 (Invalidates distribution)
---
### CIVI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Weekly confirmed) followed by high volume selling.

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence identified a Buying Climax. The latest weekly bar (2026-01-26) had extremely high volume (2.71 RelVol) with a wide spread but closed poorly in the middle/lower half (CLV -0.42). This signals heavy smart money distribution and a major change of character. Price failed to hold the high ground despite massive effort (Effort No Result on the upside).

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 29.20 (Buying Climax high), Support: 26.63 (Recent accumulation base)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $26.63 on subsequent high volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above $29.20 (Invalidates the climax top)
---
### CNQ (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Weekly), followed by sustained strength.

**Smart Money Logic:**
The 2026-01-05 bar had extremely high volume (2.04 RelVol) and a wide down spread, but managed to close in the middle, confirming Stopping Volume/Absorption in the $30-$33 zone. Following this, two consecutive weeks (01/12 and 01/19) showed strong upward movement on high/average volume, confirming absorption. The last bar (01/26) is a strong up bar closing near the high (CLV 0.66) on average volume, confirming demand continuation.

**Key Levels:** Support: 35.63 (Last Weekly Low), Resistance: 38.31 (Recent High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry on minor pullback towards $37.00, or break above $38.31.
- **Invalidation:** Close below $35.63 (Violation of last swing low)
---
### CPNG (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Weekly and Monthly).

**Smart Money Logic:**
The price remains in a downtrend (Quarterly BEARISH). The weekly action shows persistent wide spread down movement accompanied by high or very high relative volume (2.07, 1.15, 2.13 RelVol). Despite the last bar (01/26) closing in the middle (CLV 0.18) on extremely high volume (2.13 RelVol), the supply is dominating the whole sequence, suggesting aggressive selling, likely institutions liquidating positions. The momentary weakness in CLV suggests momentary absorption, but the sheer size of the volume indicates overwhelming supply.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 21.13 (Last week's open resistance), Support: 18.50 (Recent low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $18.50 (Violation of support).
- **Invalidation:** Close above $21.13
---
### CSGP (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Weekly and Monthly) with strong downside continuation.

**Smart Money Logic:**
The entire sequence confirms Supply Dominance. The 2026-01-05 weekly bar was a major down bar on massive volume (2.05 RelVol, CLV -0.98), confirming massive selling. Although there was a bounce (01/12) on high volume, the follow-through failed immediately. The last weekly bar (01/26) confirms the bear trend with high volume (1.43 RelVol), wide spread down, and a terrible close (CLV -0.92). Smart money is aggressively distributing/selling off.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 65.94 (Last Weekly Open), Support: 61.61 (Last Weekly Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $61.61 on high volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above $65.94
---
### DUOL (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Monthly and Weekly) - Downward continuation.

**Smart Money Logic:**
In a clear BEARISH Quarterly trend, the monthly chart shows extreme Supply Dominance (CLV -0.91, wide spread). The last weekly bar (2026-01-26) reinforced this with a wide spread down, poor close (CLV -0.73), and average volume (0.84 RelVol). The overall low CLV sequence (01/05, 01/12, 01/26) confirms the inability of demand to hold price, indicating persistent weakness and distribution.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 155.88 (Last Weekly High), Support: 137.00 (Recent Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $137.00 on increased volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above $155.88
---
### FISV (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Monthly and Weekly).

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart shows extreme weakness (CLV -0.93). The last weekly bar (2026-01-26) confirmed strong supply: high volume (0.81 RelVol) leading to a wide spread down and a very weak close (CLV -0.90). This indicates aggressive selling into the market, driving the price sharply lower and closing near the week's low, overcoming previous attempts at accumulation (01/19 strong CLV failed).

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 67.50 (Last Weekly Open), Support: 63.20 (Last Weekly Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $63.20.
- **Invalidation:** Close above $67.91
---
### GKOS (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Monthly) followed by major rejection.

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly sequence flagged a Buying Climax. The weekly charts show significant volatility. The 2026-01-19 bar was a wide spread up, but closed poorly (CLV -0.71) on high volume, suggesting heavy distribution near the top. The last weekly bar (01/26) reinforces this rejection: wide spread down, poor close (CLV -0.61) on average volume (0.68 RelVol). The overall inability to hold gains suggests smart money is exiting positions.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 130.22 (Recent High), Support: 116.73 (Last Weekly Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $116.73.
- **Invalidation:** Close above $130.22
---
### GWRE (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Weekly) - Strong downward continuation.

**Smart Money Logic:**
In a BEARISH Quarterly context, the weekly sequence shows aggressive selling. The 01/05 and 01/12 bars were wide spread down, poor close bars on high volume, confirming distribution. While 01/19 saw a bounce, the latest bar (01/26) delivered another wide spread down, poor close (CLV -0.80) on high volume (1.07 RelVol). This is strong confirmation of smart money continuing to sell into the rallies. Price is accelerating down.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 160.32 (Last Weekly Open), Support: 145.96 (Recent Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $145.96.
- **Invalidation:** Close above $163.46
---
### HPE (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Monthly Confirmed Early) followed by ultra-high demand.

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart signalled Stopping Volume. The 01/12 bar showed a low-CLV (weak close) on low volume (0.51 RelVol), suggesting weakness but also low supply. The final weekly bar (01/26) is an extremely strong up move, closing on the absolute high (CLV 1.0) on low volume (0.38 RelVol). This is a potential 'No Supply' or ultra-low effort, high-reward move, confirming the end of the markdown phase and the start of a strong rally.

**Key Levels:** Support: 21.02 (Last Weekly Low), Resistance: 22.71 (Previous swing high)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry immediately, targeting movement above $23.00. Alternatively, a dip towards $21.50.
- **Invalidation:** Close below $21.02
---
### HUM (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Weekly) - Extreme Selling Climax.

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly context is BEARISH, and the latest weekly bar (2026-01-26) is extremely destructive. It shows a massive spread down (77 points) on high volume (2.77 RelVol), closing near the low (CLV -0.86). This is an unambiguous Selling Climax/Supply Dominance event, confirming aggressive liquidation. Although climaxes can sometimes lead to bounces, the immediate implication is severe weakness.

**Key Levels:** Support: 191.38 (Climax Low), Resistance: 264.85 (Last Weekly Open)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short continuation below $191.38, or short on 'No Demand' bounce towards $230.
- **Invalidation:** Close above $269.08
---
### IONQ (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Monthly) followed by continued supply.

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly sequence shows a Buying Climax/Distribution. The weekly sequence confirms this. The 01/19 bar was a wide spread down, very poor close (CLV -0.63). The final bar (01/26) is a wide spread down, poor close (CLV -0.74) on average volume (0.84 RelVol). The price is failing aggressively at the highs, indicating persistent distribution. The lack of a major Selling Climax suggests an orderly liquidation is occurring.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 50.59 (Last Weekly High), Support: 42.15 (Recent Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $42.15.
- **Invalidation:** Close above $50.59
---
### IOT (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Monthly) followed by strong downward continuation.

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly sequence confirmed a Buying Climax/Distribution. The weekly chart shows aggressive selling pressure resuming after brief consolidation. The last weekly bar (2026-01-26) is a wide spread down bar, closing poorly (CLV -0.60) on high volume (1.35 RelVol). This confirms renewed supply dominance and suggests acceleration into a markdown phase.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 32.79 (Last Weekly High), Support: 28.18 (Recent Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $28.18 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above $32.79
---
### ITT (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Demand returns following Supply Dominance (Monthly).

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart signalled supply weakness in December. The weekly sequence shows continued strength. The last weekly bar (2026-01-26) is a wide spread up, closing very strongly (CLV 0.71) on average volume (0.79 RelVol). This indicates strong demand stepping in and controlling the price action, following accumulation after the major down move (01/05 bar). The price successfully moved above the high of the 01/19 bar, confirming continuation of the rally.

**Key Levels:** Support: 180.47 (Previous Open), Resistance: 185.82 (Recent High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close above $185.82.
- **Invalidation:** Close below $178.08
---
### KEY (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Demand returns in consolidation range.

**Smart Money Logic:**
Despite the Monthly chart flagging Supply Dominance, the price action is showing resilience in a BULLISH Quarterly trend. The last weekly bar (01/26) is a narrow spread up, closing extremely strong (CLV 0.82) on average volume (0.69 RelVol). This represents low effort to achieve a high close, suggesting supply dried up quickly after the preceding minor weakness (01/19, low CLV -0.02). This looks like a successful test of demand.

**Key Levels:** Support: 21.05 (Last Weekly Low), Resistance: 22.06 (Recent High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close above $22.06.
- **Invalidation:** Close below $21.05
---
### KVYO (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Weekly and Monthly) followed by failure.

**Smart Money Logic:**
The 01/05 bar was a Stopping Volume candidate (high volume, middle close). However, the subsequent price action failed dramatically (01/12 bar: wide spread down, CLV -0.96). The final weekly bar (01/26) confirms the failure: wide spread down, very poor close (CLV -0.91) on average volume. This is Supply Dominance overriding the previous accumulation efforts, suggesting smart money is selling into strength (rallies), and the trend is continuing down.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 25.79 (Last Weekly Open), Support: 22.14 (Recent Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $22.14 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above $26.32
---
### KYMR (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Monthly) followed by a strong recovery.

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly sequence flagged a potential climax, but the current weekly action suggests absorption. The 01/12 bar was a sharp down move (CLV -0.96) on average volume, shaking out weak holders. The last weekly bar (01/26) is a strong recovery, wide spread up, closing near the absolute high (CLV 0.95) on average volume (0.65 RelVol). This suggests demand easily absorbed the prior weakness and is now in control, pointing towards a Phase C spring/test.

**Key Levels:** Support: 68.28 (Recent low), Resistance: 77.92 (Recent high)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry immediately, targeting a break above $77.92.
- **Invalidation:** Close below $68.28
---
### LQDA (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Monthly Confirmed Early) followed by ultra-high demand.

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart initially flagged Supply Dominance, but the January bar closed very strong (CLV 0.84), suggesting absorption. The last weekly bar (01/26) reinforces demand: wide spread up, strong close (CLV 0.48) on average volume (0.74 RelVol). This shows price successfully navigating supply zones, confirming demand is currently controlling the short-term trend in this BULLISH Quarterly environment.

**Key Levels:** Support: 39.70 (Last Weekly Low), Resistance: 44.20 (Recent High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close above $44.20 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close below $39.70
---
### MAN (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Demand returns following Monthly Supply Dominance.

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart signaled Supply Dominance, but the January monthly bar closed strongly (CLV 0.69). The last weekly bar (2026-01-26) confirms this strength: very wide spread up, strong close (CLV 0.69) on high volume (1.10 RelVol). This aggressive push up, overcoming the resistance of the previous three weeks, suggests strong smart money buying and continuation of the BULLISH Quarterly trend.

**Key Levels:** Support: 31.03 (Last Weekly Open), Resistance: 34.13 (Recent High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry immediately, targeting continuation above $34.13.
- **Invalidation:** Close below $31.03
---
### MOD (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Weekly) followed by a decisive rally.

**Smart Money Logic:**
The 01/05 bar was an extreme Selling Climax/Stopping Volume event (2.84 RelVol, wide spread down, CLV -0.20), defining key support. Price reacted immediately (01/12 and 01/19 strong demand). The final weekly bar (01/26) is a strong confirmation of demand: massive spread up, closing strong (CLV 0.72) on high volume (1.26 RelVol). This confirms the stopping volume was successful and accumulation is transitioning to mark-up.

**Key Levels:** Support: 139.25 (Previous pivot), Resistance: 182.58 (Recent High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry immediately, targeting continuation above $182.58.
- **Invalidation:** Close below $139.25
---
### MSFU (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Weekly and Monthly) - Extreme Downward Continuation.

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH, reinforced by recent action. The final weekly bar (2026-01-26) shows extreme distribution: widest spread down, closing poorly (CLV -0.61) on astronomical volume (4.81 RelVol). This suggests a severe shock event and aggressive liquidation. This action confirms major weakness and accelerating markdown.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 38.00 (Last Weekly Open), Support: 30.43 (Recent Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on any relief rally towards $35.00, or break below $30.43.
- **Invalidation:** Close above $38.91 (High of 01/19)
---
### NET (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Weekly) followed by extreme Selling Climax.

**Smart Money Logic:**
The price action suggests heavy distribution followed by a major shakeout. The 01/26 weekly bar exhibits extreme supply: massive spread (43 points) on high volume (2.55 RelVol), closing very poorly (CLV -0.75). Despite the volume, the price failed dramatically to hold any gains, confirming widespread liquidation by smart money. This extreme move confirms the ongoing BEARISH Quarterly trend.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 184.89 (Last Weekly Open), Support: 175.07 (Recent Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on any rally towards $185.00, or continuation break below $175.07.
- **Invalidation:** Close above $205.19
---
### NFXL (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Weekly) followed by failed test.

**Smart Money Logic:**
The 01/19 weekly bar acted as Stopping Volume (ultra-high volume 3.33 RelVol, middle close CLV -0.006). However, the subsequent week (01/26) failed to confirm accumulation. It was a wide spread down, poor close (CLV -0.67) on average volume (1.30 RelVol). This indicates that the temporary absorption was overwhelmed by continued selling, confirming the BEARISH Quarterly trend continuation.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 26.00 (Last Weekly Open), Support: 23.32 (Recent Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $23.32.
- **Invalidation:** Close above $27.95
---
### OKLO (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Monthly) followed by aggressive selling.

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly context is BEARISH, and the Monthly chart flagged a Buying Climax/Distribution phase. The weekly action confirms aggressive liquidation following the climax top (01/05 high). The last bar (01/26) is a wide spread down, poor close (CLV -0.29) on average volume. Although volume is dropping, the close continues to reflect underlying weakness, suggesting a lack of committed demand to hold the price up.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 95.09 (Last Weekly High), Support: 81.12 (Recent Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $81.12.
- **Invalidation:** Close above $95.09
---
### PGY (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Weakness Confirmed

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stock is operating in a bearish quarterly trend. Recent weakness (W2 Supply Confirmation) was followed by drifting lower on moderate volume (W5 CLV -0.615). This indicates supply control and lack of responsive demand to halt the markdown.

**Key Levels:** 22.68 (Resistance/Supply), 19.64 (Immediate Target)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $19.64.
- **Invalidation:** Weekly close above $22.68
---
### PTGX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Confirmation of Weakness

**Smart Money Logic:**
Following a monthly Buying Climax warning, the weekly chart shows sustained downward movement (W2, W5 wide down spreads). The low volume in W5 confirms demand absence, allowing price to drift lower in the bearish trend.

**Key Levels:** 87.44 (Supply), 77.69 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close below $77.69.
- **Invalidation:** Weekly close above $84.31
---
### QTWO (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Confirmation / No Demand Failure

**Smart Money Logic:**
The short rally/Test in W4 was aggressively rejected in W5 by an extremely wide spread down on decent volume (0.72 RelVol), closing near the absolute low. This confirms supply control and continued markdown in the bearish quarterly trend.

**Key Levels:** 69.36 (Supply), 60.24 (Immediate Target)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $60.24.
- **Invalidation:** Weekly close above $69.36
---
### RF (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply (Successful Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
After three weeks of supply pressure, W5 showed a strong up bar closing near the high, but crucially, on the lowest relative volume (0.57 RelVol) of the period. This indicates successful absorption of supply (No Supply) and a clear path for Smart Money to mark up the price within the bullish quarterly trend.

**Key Levels:** 29.26 (Resistance), 27.25 (Test Low/Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close above $28.58 (W5 high).
- **Invalidation:** Weekly close below $27.25
---
### RGLD (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Selling after Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
The preceding three weeks saw a powerful run-up indicative of a climax. W5 reversed this aggressively with a very wide spread down, indicating heavy Smart Money distribution starting near $306. The immediate trend is now bearish.

**Key Levels:** 306.25 (Major Supply), 281.70 (Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close below $290.00.
- **Invalidation:** Weekly close above $306.25
---
### RGTI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Weakness Confirmed (Lack of Demand)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Following a monthly Buying Climax warning, the last two weeks showed severe downward momentum. W5 saw a wide spread down and closed very low on shrinking volume (0.37 RelVol), confirming that demand has evaporated, leading to a potential sharp markdown.

**Key Levels:** 23.78 (Supply), 19.27 (Immediate Target)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close below $19.27.
- **Invalidation:** Weekly close above $23.78
---
### RKT (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax Follow-through / No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
W2 was a textbook Buying Climax (extreme volume spike, high close). Subsequent weeks showed immediate supply entry and follow-through weakness. W5 is a low volume down bar, confirming No Demand and validating the distribution phase.

**Key Levels:** 23.41 (Major Supply), 20.29 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close below $20.29.
- **Invalidation:** Weekly close above $22.42

### RLI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Confirmed Weakness)

#### Action Plan

### RTO (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax Confirmed (Distribution/Reversal)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close below $31.94.
- **Invalidation:** Weekly close above $33.46
---
### RYN (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Confirmation of Weakness)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The rally attempt was decisively rejected in W5, showing a wide down bar on nearly 2.0 RelVol volume, closing near the low. This confirms heavy supply presence, negating the recent bullish effort and supporting the monthly Buying Climax warning.

**Key Levels:** 24.82 (Supply), 21.97 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close below $21.97.
- **Invalidation:** Weekly close above $24.82
---
### SARO (BEARISH)

- **Entry Trigger:** Close below $31.10.
- **Invalidation:** Weekly close above $33.46

### SATS (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Confirmed Supply Dominance / Selling Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
W3 signaled a Buying Climax (extreme volume, low close). W5 confirmed the reversal with a massive wide spread down on high volume (1.48 RelVol), closing extremely low (CLV -0.917). This indicates severe selling pressure and market weakness.

**Key Levels:** 132.25 (Major Supply), 112.66 (Immediate Target)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close below $112.66.
- **Invalidation:** Weekly close above $128.75
---
### SPOT (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Failed Rally / Supply Persistence

**Smart Money Logic:**
After major supply bars in W2 and W3, the demand reaction in W4 failed to sustain momentum. W5 reversed the rally on high volume (0.82 RelVol), confirming that supply remains active and dominant in this bearish quarterly trend.

**Key Levels:** 520.00 (Supply), 493.31 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close below $493.31.
- **Invalidation:** Weekly close above $520.00
---
### STAA (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume Failure / Supply Persistence

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Stopping Volume signal in W2 failed to produce a sustained rally. Consecutive weeks of weakness followed, with W5 showing a low volume drift down. This confirms that supply has overcome the initial absorption, aligning with the bearish quarterly trend.

**Key Levels:** 19.66 (Supply), 18.78 (Immediate Target)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close below $18.78.
- **Invalidation:** Weekly close above $19.66
---
### SYF (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume Failure / Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The strong Stopping Volume bar in W3 (1.85 RelVol) was immediately negated by strong selling in W5 (1.77 RelVol, wide down bar, low close). This signals that the earlier attempt to absorb selling failed, and supply remains dominant, confirming the bearish quarterly trend.

**Key Levels:** 77.57 (Resistance), 72.11 (Immediate Target)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close below $72.11.
- **Invalidation:** Weekly close above $77.57
---
### TRU (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Failed Rally / Weakness Confirmed

**Smart Money Logic:**
The brief rally (W2, W3) failed immediately in W4 and W5, closing poorly. The continuation down on W5 on lower volume suggests that responsive demand has dried up, allowing supply to resume control in the bearish quarterly trend.

**Key Levels:** 85.14 (Supply), 78.79 (Immediate Target)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close below $78.79.
- **Invalidation:** Weekly close above $85.14
---
### UNH (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Severe Supply Dominance / Selling Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
W5 saw a devastating, extremely wide down bar on massive, extreme volume (2.72 RelVol), crushing the prior week's rally attempt. This is major distribution and panic selling, confirming the markdown phase in the bearish quarterly trend.

**Key Levels:** 357.87 (Major Supply), 280.40 (Immediate Target)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close below $280.40.
- **Invalidation:** Weekly close above $330.00
---
### WGMI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Failed Rally / No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
Following a strong W3 up bar, the price immediately reversed (W4, W5) and closed poorly (CLV -0.139). The lower volume drift down confirms demand is lacking (No Demand), validating the monthly Buying Climax warning and setting up a short-term markdown.

**Key Levels:** 52.01 (Supply), 46.27 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close below $46.27.
- **Invalidation:** Weekly close above $52.01
---
## 👀 Watch/Monitoring
### ABT (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax / Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
The week of 01/19 saw an extreme wide down-bar on extreme volume (RelVol 2.57), marking a Selling Climax (SC). The subsequent week (01/26) had high volume but a narrow spread relative to the SC, suggesting preliminary stopping/absorption of selling pressure near the $105 area. Confirmation of accumulation requires a clear Test or Rally from this area.

**Key Levels:** Support (SC Low): $105.78, Immediate Resistance: $110.39, Major Resistance: $121.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Successful Test of SC low or close above $110.39
- **Invalidation:** $105.77
---
### ABVX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Continued Weakness (No Demand)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Despite an initial attempted bullish reversal on 01/19, the market failed to hold up. The bar on 01/26 was a wide down bar closing near its low on significantly below-average relative volume (RelVol 0.55), indicating a lack of meaningful demand stepping in to support the price. This confirms the dominance of the bearish quarterly trend.

**Key Levels:** Support: $111.34, Resistance: $125.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $111.33 on above-average volume
- **Invalidation:** $125.00
---
### AIQ (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Trading Range / Consolidation

**Smart Money Logic:**
AIQ is consolidating within a tight range ($51.80 - $53.94) after a high-volume base building phase. The last bar showed low volume but failed to close strongly, indicating slight supply presence at the top of the range. The bullish quarterly trend keeps the bias slightly positive, but patience is required for breakout confirmation.

**Key Levels:** Support: $51.83, Resistance: $53.94

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close above $53.94 on increasing volume
- **Invalidation:** $51.83
---
### AL (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Ultra Narrow Range / Dormancy

**Smart Money Logic:**
AL is trading in an exceptionally tight range at its highs on consistently low volume. This dormancy suggests institutional holding after the prior bullish push, but the proximity to the monthly Buying Climax suggests risk of a sharp reaction if the price drops below $64. The low volume indicates little immediate pressure either way.

**Key Levels:** Support: $64.06, Resistance: $64.53

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $64.53 (high volume confirmation)
- **Invalidation:** $64.06
---
### ALL (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Test of Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
A major rejection bar occurred on 01/12 (extreme volume, wide spread down, CLV -0.94), confirming supply dominance. The subsequent rally attempt (01/26) occurred on below-average volume (RelVol 0.66), classifying it as a weak Test of Supply. Smart Money is likely looking to push the price lower after this minor reaction.

**Key Levels:** Support: $191.80, Resistance: $200.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close below $192.27 on increased volume
- **Invalidation:** $200.00
---
### ARES (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Preliminary)

**Smart Money Logic:**
After significant downside weakness (01/19), the 01/26 bar showed high volume (RelVol 0.97) halting the decline. The wide spread and close away from the extreme low suggest absorption of supply around $145. This marks a potential temporary bottom, but requires a successful subsequent Test to confirm accumulation.

**Key Levels:** Support (SV Low): $145.46, Resistance: $155.09

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Successful low volume test or close above $155.09
- **Invalidation:** $145.46
---
### AS (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result Down / Failed Rally

**Smart Money Logic:**
Despite the strong close on 01/19, the following week (01/26) immediately reversed, showing a wide down bar closing poorly on low volume (RelVol 0.66). This indicates professional rejection of the higher prices and confirms supply is persistent near $38-$39, keeping the price trapped in consolidation.

**Key Levels:** Support: $36.76, Resistance: $38.90

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close below $36.76 on volume
- **Invalidation:** $38.90
---
### AXTA (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Hidden Selling / Distribution Shelf

**Smart Money Logic:**
The bar on 01/12 showed extreme volume with minimal upward spread progression, a classic sign of Hidden Selling at resistance ($34.50). The following weeks are consolidating on low volume, indicating a standoff. The market requires a decisive break to confirm whether this is re-accumulation or distribution.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: $34.50, Support: $33.42

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close above $34.50 or close below $33.42
- **Invalidation:** $34.50
---
### BE (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result Up / Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
The extreme wide up bar on 01/26 closed mid-range on high volume, indicating significant supply entry at the $167 high (Effort No Result Up). This is a strong warning sign of potential distribution/exhaustion following a prolonged markup, despite the strong monthly close.

**Key Levels:** Support: $142.00, Resistance: $167.57

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close below $142.00
- **Invalidation:** $167.57
---
### BHF (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Extreme Dormancy / No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
BHF is experiencing extreme low volatility and volume right at resistance ($64.40). Following a prior Buying Climax warning, this dormancy suggests professional participation has vanished. The lack of selling pressure is matched by a lack of buying commitment, keeping the bias slightly negative due to the quarterly trend.

**Key Levels:** Support: $63.80, Resistance: $64.40

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close below $63.80 on volume
- **Invalidation:** $64.40
---
### BP (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Pause / Minor Effort No Result Up

**Smart Money Logic:**
BP remains in a bullish context, having absorbed initial supply in early January. The 01/26 bar showed a wide range up but failed to close near the high (CLV 0.30), indicating minor supply or profit taking near $38.88. However, low volume suggests institutional demand is still controlling the direction, making this a pause before a likely breakout.

**Key Levels:** Support: $36.46, Resistance: $38.88

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close above $38.88 on high volume
- **Invalidation:** $36.46
---
### BXSL (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Demand / Weakness Persistence

**Smart Money Logic:**
The price has failed to confirm institutional demand, showing weakness on low volume (01/19, 01/26 CLV -0.59). This 'No Demand' scenario suggests that the resistance established by monthly supply dominance is holding, increasing the probability of a markdown continuation, aligning with the bearish quarterly context.

**Key Levels:** Support: $25.80, Resistance: $26.50

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close below $25.80 on volume
- **Invalidation:** $26.50
---
### CALM (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result Up (Trading Range Boundary)

**Smart Money Logic:**
CALM is establishing a Trading Range following a Selling Climax. The latest bar (01/26) showed a jump higher met by supply, closing mid-range on high volume (Effort No Result Up). This confirms supply near $84.87 and sets the upper boundary of the base, suggesting a short-term pullback is likely before testing support again.

**Key Levels:** Support: $71.89, Resistance: $84.87

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for Test near $71.89 or Breakout above $84.87
- **Invalidation:** $84.87
---
### CBSH (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Demand Absorption

**Smart Money Logic:**
The drop on 01/19 was aggressively countered on 01/26 with a high volume bar closing mid-range positive. This Stopping Volume effect suggests Smart Money stepped in to defend the $51.56 level, creating a potential short-term accumulation zone against the bearish monthly supply.

**Key Levels:** Support: $51.56, Resistance: $56.06

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close above $54.29 on volume
- **Invalidation:** $51.56
---
### CCOI (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Monthly) followed by a low volume reaction.

**Smart Money Logic:**
Monthly bar 2026-01-01 shows a wide spread up close on high relative volume, but the close is off the high, suggesting absorption/supply. However, the subsequent weekly bars show decreasing volume and volatility, indicating a lack of committed selling (or buying). The last weekly bar (2026-01-26) is a narrow spread down close with low CLV and very low RelVol, suggesting testing for supply, but the price action is inconclusive for immediate reversal.

**Key Levels:** Support: 22.26 (Last Weekly Low), Resistance: 25.05 (Recent Weekly High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $25.05 on increasing volume, or a clear 'No Supply' test near $22.50.
- **Invalidation:** Close below $20.50 (Violation of recent swing low)
---
### CMPO (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Weekly) and potential Accumulation.

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly chart shows strong upward momentum (2026-01-12 high volume/wide spread up, strong CLV 0.71). The last two weeks (2026-01-19 and 2026-01-26) are pullbacks showing narrow/moderate spread and high volume, but the price stays relatively high. The 2026-01-26 bar is Stopping Volume indicated by the wide range (due to the gap down and recovery) closing poorly (CLV -0.21) but the preceding sharp move up suggests this is a test/reaction. The Quarterly context is BULLISH.

**Key Levels:** Support: 23.60 (Recent weekly low/Stopping Volume low), Resistance: 26.50 (Recent weekly high)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A 'No Supply' bar closing strongly above $25.00, or break above $26.50.
- **Invalidation:** Close below $23.60
---
### CNXC (NEUTRAL / BEARISH watch)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Weekly) followed by weakness.

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence identified Stopping Volume on 2026-01-12 (High volume, high CLV, decent spread). However, the price has failed to follow through. The last weekly bar (2026-01-26) is a wide spread down bar closing poorly (CLV -0.29) on average volume. This indicates that supply has easily overwhelmed the recent demand efforts near the support zone ($37-$38).

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 43.86 (Area of resistance), Support: 36.00 (Recent low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $43.50 on high volume for bullish reversal, or break below $36.00 for bearish continuation.
- **Invalidation:** N/A - Waiting for directional confirmation.
---
### CORT (NEUTRAL / BULLISH watch)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Weekly) and Volume Spike Reaction.

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart shows extreme Supply Dominance followed by a sharp price bounce in January (01/01 bar CLV 0.63). The weekly bar 2025-12-29 was an extreme Selling Climax (RelVol 5.58) defining major support near $32.99. The 2026-01-19 bar showed significant demand (wide spread up, high volume, CLV 0.84). The latest bar (01/26) is a narrow spread down, poor close (CLV -0.17) on average volume. This is likely a test of the recent strength, but it needs confirmation.

**Key Levels:** Support: 42.90 (Recent pivot), Resistance: 47.06 (Recent high)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Strong close above $47.06, or a 'No Supply' test near $42.90.
- **Invalidation:** Close below $38.00
---
### CRBG (NEUTRAL / BULLISH watch)
**VSA Status:** Ultra-High CLV (Last Weekly) following a Buying Climax (Monthly).

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart signals potential distribution (Buying Climax). However, the last weekly bar (2026-01-26) shows ultra-high CLV (1.0, closing on the absolute high of the week) on low volume (0.48 RelVol). This suggests very little effort was required to push the price to the high, indicating a lack of immediate selling pressure. This strength counters the monthly Buying Climax warning, potentially setting up a new leg higher.

**Key Levels:** Support: 29.94 (Last Weekly Low), Resistance: 31.50 (Recent high)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $31.50 on increased volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close below $29.35
---
### CTRA (NEUTRAL / BEARISH watch)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Weekly confirmed) followed by high volume testing.

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence is confirmed as a Buying Climax, marked by the volatile swings on high volume. The 2026-01-12 bar had massive volume (2.07 RelVol) but only closed in the lower half (CLV -0.45), indicating distribution near the high ($28.47). The latest bar (01/26) attempted an up move but closed poorly (CLV 0.02) on average volume (0.82 RelVol), suggesting a lack of demand follow-through after the climax.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 29.05 (Recent High), Support: 27.00 (Last Weekly Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $27.00 on high volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above $29.05
---
### CVS (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Weekly) - Extreme Selling Climax.

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly context is BEARISH, reinforced by the final weekly bar (2026-01-26), which is characterized by a massive spread down (largest in the 5-week sequence) on ultra-high volume (2.01 RelVol). Despite the spread being wide, the CLV of -0.43 suggests some counter-demand or Stopping Volume activity near the low ($70.69). However, the sheer size of the volume and the gap down signal aggressive liquidation. This is an extreme move and needs confirmation, but currently points strongly to distribution.

**Key Levels:** Support: 70.69 (Selling Climax Low), Resistance: 83.25 (Last Weekly Open)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** If the price bounces, look for a 'No Demand' failure near $76.00. Short entry below $70.69 for continuation.
- **Invalidation:** Close above $82.33 (Invalidates recent supply)
---
### DOW (NEUTRAL / BEARISH watch)
**VSA Status:** Attempted Upthrust (Last Weekly).

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stock has been trending up strongly. The last weekly bar (2026-01-26) opened strongly near the highs but reversed sharply, closing near the low (CLV -0.02) on high volume (1.04 RelVol). This suggests strong rejection or an Upthrust against the prior momentum. Smart money is selling into strength near $28.50. This marks potential supply entering the market.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 28.55 (Recent High/Supply area), Support: 27.15 (Last Weekly Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close below $27.00 on subsequent volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above $28.55
---
### ENR (NEUTRAL / BULLISH watch)
**VSA Status:** Weak Test (Last Weekly).

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart shows Supply Dominance, but the last weekly bar (2026-01-26) is a high-CLV bar (0.46) on average volume (1.0 RelVol), suggesting demand returned. However, the open and close are high compared to the range, indicating resistance was easily overcome. The preceding bars show clear supply (01/12, 01/19 low CLV bars). The last bar looks like an effort to break previous supply, but the moderate volume needs aggressive follow-through.

**Key Levels:** Support: 20.46 (Recent low pivot), Resistance: 22.11 (Recent high)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close above $22.11.
- **Invalidation:** Close below $19.62
---
### FER (NEUTRAL / BEARISH watch)
**VSA Status:** Lack of Demand follow-through in uptrend.

**Smart Money Logic:**
The price has been generally bullish, but the Monthly chart indicates Supply Dominance. The last two weekly bars show diminishing results. The 01/19 bar was a decent up move but the high volume (0.72 RelVol) resulted in only a mid-close (CLV 0.28). The 01/26 bar tried to push higher but ended with a narrow spread and poor close (CLV -0.22) on low volume (0.60 RelVol). This suggests weakness and failure to follow through on demand, allowing supply to cap the rally.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 69.81 (Recent High), Support: 67.01 (Last Weekly Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $67.01 on increased volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above $69.81
---
### FFIV (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Monthly) followed by a strong upthrust.

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly setup flagged Stopping Volume. The last weekly bar (2026-01-26) is a strong recovery: wide spread up from the low, on high volume (1.47 RelVol), closing far off the absolute high (CLV -0.01). While the CLV is poor, the price managed to cover a huge range and close significantly higher than the previous week. The massive volume, combined with the extreme range expansion off the lows (swing high $303.98, low $261.85), is a potential Stopping Volume signal, absorbing supply after the recent drop.

**Key Levels:** Support: 261.85 (Stopping Volume Low), Resistance: 303.98 (Weekly High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A subsequent break and close above $285.00 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close below $261.85
---
### FIBK (NEUTRAL / BEARISH watch)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Monthly) followed by high volume pullback.

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly sequence shows a Buying Climax, suggesting distribution at higher levels. The last two weekly bars show narrow spreads and poor closes (CLV -0.49 and -0.52) on average volume (0.75, 0.65 RelVol). This indicates persistent weakness and absorption of the previous demand. The price is failing to gain momentum despite being in a Quarterly BULLISH trend, suggesting a Phase 3 distribution is underway.

**Key Levels:** Support: 35.43 (Last Weekly Low), Resistance: 38.77 (Recent High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $35.43 on elevated volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above $38.77
---
### FRPT (NEUTRAL / BULLISH watch)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Monthly) followed by Upthrust/Test.

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart indicates Stopping Volume. The weekly sequence shows a strong breakout week (01/19, wide spread up, high volume, CLV 0.69). The subsequent week (01/26) attempts to push higher but reverses, closing in the middle/lower half (CLV -0.16) on average volume (0.87 RelVol). This looks like an upthrust against the prior rally, or a high-level test. Given the BULLISH Quarterly trend, smart money may be performing a shakeout.

**Key Levels:** Support: 68.40 (Last Weekly Low), Resistance: 73.19 (Recent High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A 'No Supply' test near $69.00, or a decisive break above $73.19.
- **Invalidation:** Close below $68.40
---
### GBCI (NEUTRAL / BULLISH watch)
**VSA Status:** Demand returning but meeting resistance.

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly context is BULLISH. The last weekly bar (2026-01-26) is a narrow spread up bar, closing very strong (CLV 0.94) on average volume (0.90 RelVol). This suggests demand is returning and controlling the immediate action, pushing price towards the recent high. However, the Monthly context indicates potential Supply Dominance, so caution is needed near $50.91.

**Key Levels:** Support: 47.31 (Last Weekly Low), Resistance: 50.91 (Recent High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close above $50.91 on high volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close below $47.00
---
### GE (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Weekly) - Sharp Rejection and Selling.

**Smart Money Logic:**
The 2026-01-19 weekly bar showed extreme supply entering the market: very wide spread down, very poor close (CLV -0.77), on high volume (1.96 RelVol). This is a textbook sign of aggressive distribution. The last weekly bar (01/26) attempts to bounce, closing well off the lows (CLV 0.65) on lower volume (1.32 RelVol), but this bounce looks reactive rather than impulsive, failing to recapture the midpoint of the distribution bar.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 323.88 (Supply area), Support: 290.07 (Recent Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Look for a 'No Demand' failure near $305.00. Short entry below $290.07.
- **Invalidation:** Close above $323.88
---
### GNTX (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Monthly) in a tight consolidation.

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly sequence suggests supply is present. The weekly price action is extremely tight, indicating low volatility and potentially a re-accumulation/re-distribution phase. The last bar (01/26) is a narrow up bar, strong close (CLV 0.67) on low volume (0.84 RelVol). This suggests lack of strong supply, but the overall tight range makes a strong directional conviction difficult. Current behavior suggests a potential spring if support holds.

**Key Levels:** Support: 23.34 (Recent low), Resistance: 24.53 (Recent high)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $24.53 on volume, or a sudden volume spike near $23.40.
- **Invalidation:** Close below $23.34
---
### HDB (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Weekly) followed by potential Selling Climax/Test.

**Smart Money Logic:**
The 01/05 bar was a clear Selling Climax/Supply Dominance bar (2.88 RelVol, CLV -0.90). Price dipped significantly. The subsequent weeks saw reduced volatility. The last weekly bar (01/26) is a very narrow spread bar, closing strong (CLV 0.64) on high volume (1.21 RelVol). The high volume in this narrow range suggests a successful test or absorption of lingering supply, but the range is too tight for aggressive entry.

**Key Levels:** Support: 32.04 (Last Weekly Low), Resistance: 33.09 (Climax Low Pivot)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close above $33.60 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close below $32.04
---
### HRMY (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Monthly) followed by consolidation.

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stock is in a range after failing to hold higher prices (Monthly Supply Dominance). The weekly price action is choppy. The 01/12 bar was a wide down move on high volume (1.03 RelVol), suggesting supply re-entering the market. The last bar (01/26) is a narrow down bar, closing poorly (CLV -0.44) on low volume (0.51 RelVol). This suggests a weak test but also poor demand follow-through after the 01/19 rally. Inconclusive range bound action.

**Key Levels:** Support: 36.43 (Recent pivot), Resistance: 39.40 (Recent high)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $38.00 or below $36.43 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** N/A - Wait for clear direction out of the range
---
### IMAX (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Monthly) followed by reaction.

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart flagged Stopping Volume. The weekly price action is volatile. The 01/12 bar showed demand returning (wide up spread, high CLV 0.90). However, the 01/19 bar rejected this effort (wide down spread, low CLV -0.82) on average volume. The last bar (01/26) is a narrow range down, poor close (CLV -0.16) on extremely low volume (0.43 RelVol). This low volume test suggests smart money is absent, needing a stronger catalyst for direction.

**Key Levels:** Support: 33.70 (Recent low), Resistance: 37.61 (Recent high)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $37.61 on volume for bullish continuation.
- **Invalidation:** Close below $33.70
---
### INVH (NEUTRAL / BEARISH watch)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Weekly Confirmed Early) followed by supply persistence.

**Smart Money Logic:**
The 01/05 bar was a large-volume Selling Climax (2.56 RelVol). The 01/12 bar was a strong reaction off the low, wide spread up, high CLV (0.98), confirming absorption. However, the subsequent two weeks failed to deliver follow-through. The last bar (01/26) is a down bar, poor close (CLV -0.63) on high volume (0.93 RelVol). This suggests that the absorbed supply is being overwhelmed by renewed selling pressure, invalidating the initial Stopping Volume bounce.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 27.78 (Last swing high), Support: 26.12 (Last Weekly Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $26.12 on increased volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above $27.78

### IREN (NEUTRAL / BULLISH watch)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result on the up move.

**Smart Money Logic:**
In a BULLISH Quarterly trend, the stock exhibits high volatility characteristic of a strong trend. The 01/12 bar was a wide up move, closing strong on high volume (1.19 RelVol). The last bar (01/26) is a massive spread up, ultra-high effort (Volume 0.97 RelVol), but the close is significantly off the high (CLV 0.36), suggesting some supply absorbed the move near $63.59. This is an Effort No Result on the short term, but the underlying trend is strong.

**Key Levels:** Support: 56.11 (Last Weekly Open), Resistance: 63.59 (Recent High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $63.59 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close below $51.78
---
### JPM (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Weekly) followed by a sharp bounce.

**Smart Money Logic:**
The 01/12 and 01/19 bars showed aggressive distribution (high volume, wide spread down, poor CLV), confirming the BEARISH Quarterly trend. However, the last weekly bar (01/26) is a strong recovery: narrow spread up, closing near the absolute high (CLV 0.91) on average volume (0.92 RelVol). This is a potential high-quality 'No Supply' or low-effort demand signal, suggesting absorption of the recent selling pressure.

**Key Levels:** Support: 297.45 (Last Weekly Low), Resistance: 311.14 (Previous Swing High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close above $311.14 on increased volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close below $297.45
---
### KDP (NEUTRAL / BEARISH watch)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Monthly) followed by range action/weakness.

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart signalled a Buying Climax. The weekly chart shows a very tight range consolidation near the top. The last weekly bar (01/26) is a down bar, poor close (CLV -0.39) on average volume (0.54 RelVol). This subtle weakness, combined with the lack of effort to push higher, suggests smart money is distributing within this narrow range, preparing for a potential drop.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 27.78 (Last Weekly High), Support: 26.39 (Recent Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $26.39 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above $28.01
---
### LHX (NEUTRAL / BEARISH watch)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Weekly) - Effort No Result.

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence identified a Buying Climax. The 01/12 bar was a massive up move on massive volume (2.09 RelVol) but closed poorly (CLV -0.05). This confirms large-scale distribution/selling at the high. The last bar (01/26) is a wide spread up bar on high volume (1.03 RelVol), but closes exactly in the middle (CLV -0.49). High effort yielded middling results, confirming persistent supply distribution near $360-$370.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 369.59 (Buying Climax High), Support: 351.48 (Last Weekly Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $351.48 on high volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above $369.59
---
### NICE (NEUTRAL / BEARISH watch)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Monthly) followed by a sharp rejection.

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart flags Supply Dominance. The weekly sequence shows recent weakness: the last bar (01/26) is a wide spread down, poor close (CLV -0.58) on low volume (0.64 RelVol). The wide spread on low volume suggests a weak market where small selling effort moves the price dramatically, indicating weak professional support. This is a sign of underlying weakness near $115.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 117.20 (Recent High), Support: 106.00 (Recent Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $106.00 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above $117.20
---
### OC (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Monthly) followed by high-level range bound action.

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart flagged Stopping Volume. The weekly price action is consolidating at high levels (between $116 and $126). The last weekly bar (01/26) is a down bar, poor close (CLV -0.28) on average volume (0.90 RelVol). This is a reversal from the high ($125.30) suggesting supply is present, but the overall context remains generally bullish (Quarterly BULLISH). The price is in a clear trading range, needing a break for direction.

**Key Levels:** Support: 116.87 (Range Low), Resistance: 126.91 (Range High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $126.91 on high volume, or a test of $117.00.
- **Invalidation:** Close below $116.87
---
### ONB (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Demand Absorption

**Smart Money Logic:**
Despite a monthly supply warning, the last weekly bar closed strongly (CLV 0.96) on moderate volume (0.61 RelVol), absorbing immediate selling pressure and challenging recent highs. Smart Money appears to be supporting a move higher.

**Key Levels:** 24.78 (Resistance), 23.37 (Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close above $24.78 (breaking monthly high resistance).
- **Invalidation:** Weekly close below $23.37
---
### OZK (NEUTRAL/BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Follow-through (weakening)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Week 4 was a massive Supply Dominance signal (2.05 RelVol, low CLV). Week 5 showed a small recovery on lower volume (0.82 RelVol), but the heavy distribution confirmed earlier means the bearish bias remains until that supply is thoroughly tested or negated.

**Key Levels:** 49.69 (Supply), 45.77 (Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short below $45.63, or confirmed low volume Test failure near $47.76.
- **Invalidation:** Weekly close above $48.47
---
### PB (NEUTRAL/BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Seeking Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
After a failed rally attempt (W4 Effort No Result), W5 exhibited ultra-high volume (1.98 RelVol) on a wide down bar, often characterizing a shakeout or Stopping Volume event. This suggests Smart Money accumulation is underway, clearing weak hands.

**Key Levels:** 76.08 (Supply), 65.12 (Stopping Volume Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Successful low volume Test (No Supply bar) in the $65.12 - $67.00 range.
- **Invalidation:** Weekly close below $65.12
---
### PSN (NEUTRAL/BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Up Thrust followed by Weakness

**Smart Money Logic:**
The brief two-week rally failed near $74.63, confirmed by the wide down bar in W5, closing lower on low volume (0.69 RelVol). This suggests the rally was an Up Thrust into active supply in a bearish quarterly context.

**Key Levels:** 74.63 (Supply), 69.18 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close below $69.18 (confirming short-term breakdown).
- **Invalidation:** Weekly close above $74.63
---
### QQQI (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Demand Persistence/Absorption

**Smart Money Logic:**
Despite a high volume Effort No Result bar in W3 (1.22 RelVol), the market demonstrated resilience in W4 (wide spread down but strong close) and W5, holding near highs. Demand is actively absorbing supply in line with the overall bullish quarterly trend.

**Key Levels:** 54.84 (Target/Resistance), 53.56 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and hold above $54.67 (W5 high).
- **Invalidation:** Weekly close below $53.56
---
### RARE (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Confirmation of Distribution)

**Smart Money Logic:**
A Buying Climax (W1) led to confirmed distribution (W2, W3). W5 showed a rally failure (Up Thrust) on low volume, confirming that supply is dominant and demand is insufficient to challenge the highs, continuing the bearish quarterly context.

**Key Levels:** 25.00 (Major Supply), 22.00 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close below $22.00.
- **Invalidation:** Weekly close above $25.00
---
### RVMD (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Confirmed Distribution / Sign of Weakness

**Smart Money Logic:**
After a massive blow-off top (W2), price collapsed significantly in W5 on high volume. The wide spread down and high volume confirms aggressive selling pressure and the continuation of the markdown phase following distribution.

**Key Levels:** 121.61 (Major Supply), 92.50 (Immediate Target)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close below $92.50.
- **Invalidation:** Weekly close above $101.93
---
### SA (NEUTRAL/BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Up Thrust Failure / Supply Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
A strong breakout attempt in W4 was immediately nullified by a wide, high volume (1.16 RelVol) down bar in W5, closing poorly. This suggests the W4 rally was used for distribution (Up Thrust), confirming active supply aligning with the monthly SD context.

**Key Levels:** 37.99 (Supply), 31.81 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry below $31.81.
- **Invalidation:** Weekly close above $37.99
---
### TFX (NEUTRAL/BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result Up (Rally into Supply)

**Smart Money Logic:**
After severe markdown, W5 shows a bounce (up close) on high volume (1.26 RelVol). Given the extreme supply presence previously and the bearish quarterly trend, this high-effort rally is likely running into overhead supply, requiring caution.

**Key Levels:** 107.06 (Supply), 102.94 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Failure to hold $105.00 level, followed by a close below $102.94.
- **Invalidation:** Weekly close above $107.06
---
### USIG (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result Down / Distribution in a tight range

**Smart Money Logic:**
The high volume spike in W3 (2.36 RelVol) resulted in only a middle close within a very tight range, signaling significant supply absorbing demand. The stock is currently consolidating near highs under supply pressure.

**Key Levels:** 52.12 (Range High), 51.70 (Range Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close outside the $51.70 - $52.12 range on higher volume.
- **Invalidation:** N/A (Range trading setup)
---
### VONG (NEUTRAL/BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Test / Consolidation after Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
W3 was a likely Stopping Volume event (2.51 RelVol). W4 saw a strong recovery, and W5 consolidated these gains on lower volume (0.72 RelVol), suggesting supply may have been cleared. We are waiting for follow-through strength.

**Key Levels:** 123.18 (Resistance), 118.65 (Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close above $123.18.
- **Invalidation:** Weekly close below $118.65
---
### WRB (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Demand Reaction / Tentative Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
After weeks of weakness, W5 saw a sharp bounce on a wide spread and moderate volume, suggesting demand entered to halt the decline (Tentative Stopping Volume). Given the bearish quarterly trend, this bounce needs confirmation via a successful low-volume test.

**Key Levels:** 69.92 (Supply), 65.02 (Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Confirmed No Supply test above $65.02.
- **Invalidation:** Weekly close below $65.02
---
## Other
### ACLX (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result Down / Shakeout

**Smart Money Logic:**
The rally attempt failed spectacularly on 01/19 with a wide spread and very high volume closing near the low (CLV -0.67), indicating heavy overhead supply overwhelmed demand. The last week (01/26) is consolidating on low volume, typical after a major supply shock, suggesting a possible short-term bottom, but the overall immediate signal is bearish weakness.

**Key Levels:** Support: $66.00, Resistance: $76.50

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close above $69.70 on high volume
- **Invalidation:** $66.00
---
### ACN (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Weakness / Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar (01/26) showed a huge downside spread, closing near the absolute low, indicating major weakness and supply dominance. This occurred on moderate volume, suggesting deep structural weakness rather than climactic selling. Smart money is clearly unloading or stepping aside.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: $286.57, Support: $257.36

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close below $257.36
- **Invalidation:** $286.57
---
### AEO (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Distribution

**Smart Money Logic:**
Following the monthly Buying Climax, the price action shows sequential downside thrusts (01/19, 01/26) closing poorly. The monthly CLV of -0.84 reinforces that sellers took control decisively in January. Expect further downside to test deeper support.

**Key Levels:** Support: $22.88, Resistance: $24.36

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close below $22.88
- **Invalidation:** $24.36
---
### AEVA (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Breakdown Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
Following a spectacular Buying Climax on 01/05, supply immediately flooded the market, overwhelming demand (confirmed by extreme negative CLV on 01/19 and 01/26). The price is now sinking rapidly toward the accumulation base, confirming professional distribution at the highs ($21+ zone).

**Key Levels:** Support: $13.13, Resistance: $19.45

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $13.13
- **Invalidation:** $15.81
---
### AGIO (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result Down / Supply Persistence

**Smart Money Logic:**
The price remains trapped in a bearish structure. The wide down bar on 01/26, closing at the low, quickly erased the gains of the prior week, demonstrating persistent supply within the $27-$30 range. Smart Money is maintaining control of the downside pressure.

**Key Levels:** Support: $27.42, Resistance: $29.93

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close below $27.42 on volume
- **Invalidation:** $29.93
---
### AMH (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Test Failure / Weakness Returns

**Smart Money Logic:**
A strong Stopping Volume signal (01/05) was followed by a Sign of Strength (01/12), establishing a potential accumulation range. However, the last bar (01/26) closed poorly, failing the immediate test and suggesting supply remains active above $31. Bias remains neutral until clear commitment below $30.63 or above $32.45.

**Key Levels:** Support (Accumulation Zone): $28.85 - $30.63, Resistance: $32.65

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close above $32.45 on volume
- **Invalidation:** $28.85
---
### AMZU (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result Down / No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
After a failed climax move (01/05), price failed to sustain subsequent rallies. The 01/26 bar entered the trading week strong but finished poorly (CLV -0.12) on low volume, indicating immediate selling pressure and lack of sustained demand. This confirms continued weakness within the bearish quarterly framework.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: $40.40, Support: $36.25

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close below $36.25 on volume
- **Invalidation:** $39.71
---
### APH (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Major Shakeout / Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
The extreme wide down bar on 01/26 with extreme volume (RelVol 2.02) acted as a violent Shakeout against the established bullish trend. Crucially, the price closed well off the low, suggesting strong absorption by Smart Money in the $140-$145 area. This is likely a spring action clearing resistance for a future mark-up.

**Key Levels:** Support (Shakeout Low): $140.00, Resistance: $157.53

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Successful low volume test of $145, followed by a break above $150.99
- **Invalidation:** $140.00
---
### AZN (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result Down / Supply Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
After intense absorption/selling near $96 (01/12), the market violently rejected higher prices on 01/26. The wide down bar closed at the absolute low (CLV -0.99) on high volume (RelVol 0.95), confirming that supply overwhelmed demand decisively. This move puts pressure back on the accumulation low ($89).

**Key Levels:** Support: $89.04, Resistance: $96.18

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close below $92.57 on volume
- **Invalidation:** $96.18
---
### BABX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result Up / Supply Persistence

**Smart Money Logic:**
Multiple strong upward efforts (01/12, 01/19) were decisively rejected near $53, confirmed by poor CLV readings. This indicates significant overhead supply (Distribution). The market is failing to follow through, aligning with the bearish quarterly context.

**Key Levels:** Support: $46.36, Resistance: $53.35

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close below $46.36
- **Invalidation:** $53.35
---
### BEP (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Weakness Returns / Failed Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
Following the confirmed Supply Dominance on 01/05, the recent consolidation failed to sustain a positive trend. The last bar (01/26) showed a negative close (CLV -0.56) on low volume, indicating a return of weakness and confirmation that demand is weak at current levels.

**Key Levels:** Support: $28.21, Resistance: $29.32

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close below $28.21
- **Invalidation:** $29.32
---
### BKSY (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Weakness Confirmed / Supply Entry

**Smart Money Logic:**
The failure to sustain momentum above $29 (01/12 ENoRU) led to weakness confirmation on 01/26. The wide down bar, closing poorly (CLV -0.67) on low volume, indicates institutional supply is dominating the immediate action, starting a distribution markdown phase.

**Key Levels:** Support: $24.03, Resistance: $29.79

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close below $24.03
- **Invalidation:** $26.50
---
### CAI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Weakness Confirmed / Supply Persistence

**Smart Money Logic:**
The sequence of high volume bars showed demand attempts failing against relentless supply. The last two bars (01/19, 01/26) confirm structural weakness with poor closes on high volume. Smart Money is maintaining control of the markdown, supported by the bearish quarterly context.

**Key Levels:** Support: $24.57, Resistance: $26.85

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close below $24.57
- **Invalidation:** $26.85
