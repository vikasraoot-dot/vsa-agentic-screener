---
### ZM (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
The volume spike in late January (RelVol 2.0) at price highs identifies a Buying Climax where Smart Money distributed into retail demand. Following this, 'Effort Versus Result' was seen as high volume failed to push prices higher. The most recent week shows 'No Demand' (low volume, narrowing spread) below recent highs, indicating the path of least resistance is now down as professional support is absent.

**Key Levels:** 97.58, 92.60, 88.02, 82.79

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below the recent weekly low of $88.02.
- **Invalidation:** 96.52
---
## 👀 Watch/Monitoring
### ABT (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Significant selling effort (RelVol 2.57) on the 2026-01-19 down bar has not been neutralized. Recent low-volume recovery attempts show lack of institutional demand.

**Key Levels:** 105.78, 113.76

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 105.27 with high volume
- **Invalidation:** 115.30
---
### ABVX (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
Price is rising on decreasing relative volume (0.57), suggesting smart money is not supporting the mark-up. Lack of effort on the upside indicates a potential bull trap.

**Key Levels:** 110.98, 133.42

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Up-thrust or high volume reversal at 133
- **Invalidation:** 135.00
---
### ACM (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result

**Smart Money Logic:**
A massive volume spike on 2026-02-09 resulted in a deep close with very negative CLV. The following recovery on lower volume suggests professional selling on the bounce.

**Key Levels:** 87.56, 109.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 87.50
- **Invalidation:** 101.50
---
### ACWI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
RelVol spiked to 2.11 on a down move followed by a weak close. While the latest bar recovered, it remains under the supply shadow of the early February volume peak.

**Key Levels:** 142.92, 148.41

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Failure to hold 146.00
- **Invalidation:** 148.50
---
### ACWX (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
Price is pushing higher but volume is steadily tapering off (RelVol 1.02 vs 2.27 previously). This suggests exhaustion of demand at the top of the range.

**Key Levels:** 70.30, 74.17

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Up-thrust on high volume
- **Invalidation:** 75.00
---
### ADP (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Panic Selling / Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Aggressive institutional liquidation is evident. Massive relative volume (2.10) on wide-spread down bars with negative CLV shows no signs of professional support yet.

**Key Levels:** 205.33, 231.36

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 205.00
- **Invalidation:** 218.85
---
### ADSK (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
High volume on down bars has begun to find support. The narrowing spread and low volume on the 2026-02-16 bar suggests a 'Test' of the selling pressure.

**Key Levels:** 216.01, 247.12

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Spring or high volume engulfing bar
- **Invalidation:** 216.00
---
### AEVA (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
Downward trend with very low relative volume on the latest move (0.37). While supply is drying up, there is no evidence of demand entering the market.

**Key Levels:** 11.18, 15.81

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for demand spike
- **Invalidation:** 14.30
---
### AFRM (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Significant selling volume on the move from 74 to 48. The current narrow spread indicates a lack of interest, but the trend remains heavily under supply dominance.

**Key Levels:** 46.76, 64.62

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 46.70
- **Invalidation:** 57.00
---
### AHR (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
Extreme volume spike (RelVol 3.99) on 2026-01-26 failed to push price significantly higher. The current narrowing spread on low volume suggests the professionals are offloading.

**Key Levels:** 45.37, 53.10

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** High volume reversal or break below 51.50
- **Invalidation:** 54.00
---
### AIQ (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
Price is drifting lower on low volume. Monthly context shows a buying climax being followed by a lack of follow-through, a bearish sign for the long term.

**Key Levels:** 48.26, 53.94

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break of 48.20
- **Invalidation:** 50.15
---
### AJG (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
A massive high-volume down move (RelVol 2.61) on 2026-02-09 indicates heavy institutional selling. The recovery attempt is weak and on lower volume.

**Key Levels:** 195.00, 256.60

#### Action Plan
