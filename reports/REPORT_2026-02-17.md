---
### GKOS (BEARISH)

- **Invalidation:** $34.00
---
### HIMS (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Climactic Selling

**Smart Money Logic:**
Incredible volume (RelVol 2.67) on a massive downward move. While this can be stopping volume, the CLV (-0.65) is too low to suggest a bottom is in. Professional selling is dominant.

- **Invalidation:** $90.80
---
### HUM (NEUTRAL)

- **Invalidation:** $169.00

- **Invalidation:** $36.50
---
### IONX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
Extreme high volume (RelVol 2.43) on a massive decline. While it shows some absorption attempt, the subsequent weak move on high volume (RelVol 1.97) suggests supply is still hitting.

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Bullish reversal bar on high volume
- **Invalidation:** $8.60
---
### IQV (BEARISH)
