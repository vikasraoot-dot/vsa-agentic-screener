## 🚀 Ready for Entry
### ADBE (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
Massive volume (RelVol 1.93) on a down week that managed to close off the lows (CLV 0.30). After a sustained bearish trend, this suggests smart money is providing a floor.

**Key Levels:** 251.10, 270.79, 293.25

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Successful test of 255.00 on low volume
- **Invalidation:** 250.00
---
### AGIO (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
Despite the sideways price action, volume is drying up on down moves. The 2026-02-09 week saw low volume and a positive CLV (0.31), indicating supply is exhausted.

**Key Levels:** 26.04, 28.97, 29.93

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 29.00
- **Invalidation:** 26.00
---
### AHR (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
While in a 'Buying Climax' stage, the CLV remains positive (0.65) and price is making higher highs. However, the rising RelVol suggests we are approaching a Blow-off Top.

**Key Levels:** 52.47, 48.58, 45.37

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Follow-through above 52.50
- **Invalidation:** 48.50
---
### ALL (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Despite 'Supply Dominance' warnings, the stock closed very strong (CLV 0.79) on 1.37 RelVol. This indicates supply was present but was overwhelmed by even stronger demand.

**Key Levels:** 198.17, 208.59, 216.75

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 208.60
- **Invalidation:** 198.00
---
### AMH (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
Persistent RelVol above 1.40 with price holding steady and finishing with a positive CLV. This indicates a 'quiet' accumulation where supply is being soaked up.

**Key Levels:** 30.13, 32.17, 32.65

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 32.20
- **Invalidation:** 30.50
---
### AMSC (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
A perfect VSA 'Stopping Volume' setup. RelVol spiked to 2.12 and price reversed sharply to close in the upper third (CLV 0.68). Demand has clearly entered.

**Key Levels:** 27.74, 35.50, 24.87

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 34.50
- **Invalidation:** 27.50
---
### APH (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Price closed high (CLV 0.64) on 1.35 RelVol after a dip. This indicates that while supply was present, demand came in aggressively to sweep the floor.

**Key Levels:** 136.61, 148.87, 126.21

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 149.00
- **Invalidation:** 136.00
---
### AS (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stock hit new highs on 1.55 RelVol and held its gains reasonably well. Monthly supply dominance is being challenged by fresh weekly demand.

**Key Levels:** 37.90, 41.31, 36.36

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 41.31
- **Invalidation:** 37.50
---
### ATO (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
Strong price action with a high CLV (0.86) on 1.39 RelVol. Despite being in a 'climax' zone, the bulls are clearly in control of the tape.

**Key Levels:** 169.82, 179.94, 174.57

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 180.00
- **Invalidation:** 170.00
---
### AXTA (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
Price is holding steady near its highs. The low volume on the 2026-02-09 retracement (1.23 RelVol with positive CLV the week prior) suggests selling pressure is low.

**Key Levels:** 33.51, 35.12, 34.55

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 35.15
- **Invalidation:** 33.40
---
### BAM (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
High volume on the down-move to 46.75 was absorbed by smart money, followed by a price recovery on high CLV (0.56) and sustained relative volume, indicating professional support.

**Key Levels:** 46.75, 53.46, 55.93

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Price holds above 52.65 with narrowing spreads
- **Invalidation:** 46.75
---
### BBIO (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

- **Entry Trigger:** High volume break above 118.00
- **Invalidation:** 106.50
---
### SPOT (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
Extreme RelVol (3.08) resulted in a bar that failed to hold its gains. This is institutional distribution ('Buying Climax'). Professional money is exiting into the retail rush.

**Key Levels:** 410.21 (Support), 504.83 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** N/A
- **Invalidation:** 505.00
---
### SSNC (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Selling volume is rising (RelVol 2.39) on a weak weekly close. Monthly context also shows deteriorating price action and heavy supply.

**Key Levels:** 69.98 (Support), 77.11 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** N/A
- **Invalidation:** 77.20
---
### SYF (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
High relative volume (1.87) on a down-bar with a negative CLV (-0.48) indicates that professionals are liquidating into the move. The weekly supply dominance confirms sellers are in control, and the quarterly bearish trend provides a heavy macro backdrop.

**Key Levels:** 75.50 (Resistance), 69.96 (Recent Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Failure to hold 72.00 on rising volume
- **Invalidation:** 76.50
---
### TROW (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Extremely high relative volume (2.12 and 1.77) on wide-spread down bars. This price action suggests a 'bag-holding' scenario where the market is overwhelmed by supply. There is no evidence of professional support yet.

**Key Levels:** 97.67 (Resistance), 91.70 (Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 91.70 with increased volume
- **Invalidation:** 98.50
---
### TWLO (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
Relatively high volume (2.28) on the most recent bar but the price is hovering near the lows. While the algorithm detects stopping volume, the lack of a strong bounce indicates supply is still being processed. We need a successful test of this low.

**Key Levels:** 105.15 (Support), 121.60 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** High volume reversal above 115.00
- **Invalidation:** 105.00
---
### UBER (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Consistent selling on high relative volume (1.86 then 1.61) with negative CLVs shows institutional distribution. The stock is making lower highs and lower lows with no signs of bottoming.

**Key Levels:** 75.05 (Resistance), 69.02 (Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break of 69.00 on high volume
- **Invalidation:** 76.00
---
### UGI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
Algorithm detects a buying climax. The high volume move two weeks ago failed to see follow-through, and the current relative volume is decreasing on the bounce, suggesting a lack of professional demand at these highs.

**Key Levels:** 41.34 (Resistance), 36.93 (Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 36.90
- **Invalidation:** 41.50
---
### VLTO (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
Relatively high volume on a down-move followed by a weak bounce (RelVol 1.82 but low CLV -0.21). This suggests the bounce is being used by professionals to exit rather than accumulate.

**Key Levels:** 95.56 (Resistance), 88.40 (Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break of 90.50
- **Invalidation:** 96.00
---
### VNO (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Extremely high relative volume (2.99) on a down-bar closing near the low. This indicates intense selling pressure with no visible support from the 'smart money' yet.

**Key Levels:** 28.08 (Support), 32.98 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 28.00
- **Invalidation:** 31.50
---
### VNT (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The most recent bar has very high relative volume (2.23) but a negative CLV (-0.36) and a massive spread, suggesting an 'Upthrust' or 'Buying Climax' where sellers have entered the market at the top of the range.

**Key Levels:** 48.20 (Resistance), 38.79 (Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break of 41.50 support
- **Invalidation:** 48.50
---
### VONG (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Strong supply present with high relative volume (2.37) on a down bar and a very poor CLV (-0.85). This indicates that every bounce is being met with professional selling.

**Key Levels:** 114.49 (Support), 119.33 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break of 114.50
- **Invalidation:** 118.00
---
### WAY (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
High relative volume (2.06) on a breakdown move with price closing near the low. The smart money is clearly positioned on the short side as it breaks quarterly bearish trend levels.

**Key Levels:** 21.45 (Support), 24.77 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Failure to recover 23.00
- **Invalidation:** 25.00
---
### WGMI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
The most recent week shows low relative volume (0.76) on a small spread. Following a larger down-move, this indicates 'No Demand' from professionals, suggesting lower prices are likely.

**Key Levels:** 44.50 (Resistance), 34.99 (Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 39.32
- **Invalidation:** 45.00
---
### WMG (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
Relatively high volume (1.49) on a narrow spread down bar suggests some absorption, but the quarterly bearish context and lack of demand (RelVol 0.66 recently) makes this a high-risk long.

**Key Levels:** 28.47 (Support), 31.19 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Strong move above 30.50 on rising volume
- **Invalidation:** 28.00
---
### WYNN (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
High relative volume (1.95) on a very wide spread indicates massive churn. The middle-range close suggests a battle between buyers and sellers is currently a stalemate.

**Key Levels:** 104.06 (Support), 119.19 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Successful test of 105.00 on low volume
- **Invalidation:** 104.00
---
### XYL (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
VSA status of Supply Dominance is confirmed by the very high relative volume (2.71) on a massive down bar. Closing below the previous month's low signals further weakness.

**Key Levels:** 123.98 (Support), 142.97 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 123.90
- **Invalidation:** 138.00
---
### Z (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Massive relative volume (3.51) on a collapse to new lows. CLV of -0.86 shows no professional support. This is a clear markdown phase.

**Key Levels:** 42.50 (Support), 56.25 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 42.50
- **Invalidation:** 54.60
---
### ZM (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
Relative volume remains high (1.53), but the spread is narrowing and price is failing to make significant progress. This 'Effort with No Result' at the top suggests professional distribution.

**Key Levels:** 88.60 (Support), 96.52 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 91.50
- **Invalidation:** 97.00
