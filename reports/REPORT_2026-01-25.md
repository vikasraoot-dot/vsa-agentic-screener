## 🚀 Ready for Entry
### AGIO (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Potential No Supply/Reversal

**Smart Money Logic:**
Despite the bearish quarterly trend, the current weekly bar shows a strong close (CLV 0.60) on below-average volume (RelVol 0.76). This indicates reduced selling pressure following potential accumulation indicated by the Monthly Stopping Volume. Lack of sellers allows the price to rise easily.

**Key Levels:** 26.25 (Support), 29.44 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Buy above 29.10 with confirmation volume, or on a deep pullback test.
- **Invalidation:** 26.25
---
### AIQ (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Demand Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
A strong high close (CLV 0.80) on near-average volume immediately negated the prior week's weakness. This confirms underlying strength and absorption of supply, consistent with continuation within the Bullish Trend. Smart Money is supporting the price.

**Key Levels:** 51.83 (Support), 53.25 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Breakout above 53.25.
- **Invalidation:** 51.83
---
### ALC (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Secondary Test/Demand Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
Demand defended the lows (78.26), allowing the price to rally and close positively after a test. This action confirms the accumulation phase signaled by the Monthly Stopping Volume, suggesting a markup phase is imminent.

**Key Levels:** 77.88 (Support), 82.50 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Breakout above 82.50 or buying the first low-volume pullback to 79.50.
- **Invalidation:** 77.88
---
### ALL (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Automatic Rally Failure/Weakness Confirmed

**Smart Money Logic:**
Following the Selling Climax (Jan 12), the market failed to rally significantly, resulting in a poor close (CLV 0.01) on high volume (RelVol 1.09). This indicates absorption of demand and confirms pervasive supply pressure. A break of the climax low (191.13) is likely.

**Key Levels:** 191.13 (Support/Climax Low), 196.08 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on break below 191.13.
- **Invalidation:** 196.08
---
### APGE (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Extreme Supply Confirmation/Effort Down

**Smart Money Logic:**
Very high volume (RelVol 2.18) on a wide down bar closing near the low indicates overwhelming supply pressure. Smart Money is aggressively selling, confirming the Quarterly Bearish Trend and subsequent Supply Dominance.

**Key Levels:** 67.97 (Support), 75.01 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry confirmed below 67.97.
- **Invalidation:** 77.88
---
### ARE (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Demand Confirmation/Bullish Effort

**Smart Money Logic:**
Strong high close (CLV 0.96) on above-average volume confirms aggressive buying and successful penetration of resistance levels. This indicates the continuation of the Quarterly Bullish Trend.

**Key Levels:** 56.00 (Support), 59.75 (New Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Buy above 59.75.
- **Invalidation:** 56.00
---
### ARES (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Confirmation/Decisive Down Bar

**Smart Money Logic:**
Extreme low close (CLV -0.97) on a very wide spread confirms aggressive selling pressure, fulfilling the bearish implications of the Monthly Buying Climax. Price has broken key support and is likely to continue its Automatic Reaction (AR) phase.

**Key Levels:** 155.74 (Support), 166.42 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry below 155.74.
- **Invalidation:** 169.69
---
### AS (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Demand Confirmation/Reversal

**Smart Money Logic:**
An extremely strong high close (CLV 0.98) on near-average volume immediately negated the prior week's weakness, signaling aggressive demand entering the market and overriding the Monthly Supply Dominance signal.

**Key Levels:** 35.54 (Support), 38.72 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Buy on breakout above 37.74 or on a low volume test near 36.50.
- **Invalidation:** 35.54
---
### ATO (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Upthrust/Supply Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
Extreme volume (RelVol 2.15) on a wide spread down, closing poorly, signals an Upthrust failure. The previous week's bullish attempt was absorbed and sold into aggressively by Smart Money, confirming bearish control within the Quarterly Trend.

**Key Levels:** 163.57 (Support), 172.08 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry confirmed below 165.00.
- **Invalidation:** 172.08
---
### AXTI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Confirmation/Effort Down

**Smart Money Logic:**
High volume on a wide bar closing extremely low (CLV -0.86) confirms overwhelming supply pressure. The bearish reaction following the Buying Climax is continuing strongly, indicating distribution by Smart Money.

**Key Levels:** 17.01 (Support), 22.69 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on break below 17.01.
- **Invalidation:** 22.69
---
### AZN (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Demand Confirmation/Successful Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
Extreme high closing price (CLV 0.97) on above-average volume confirms a major reversal from the prior week's Selling Climax. Demand is now firmly in control, suggesting a strong markup phase is starting, supporting the Bullish Quarterly Trend.

**Key Levels:** 89.04 (Support), 96.51 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Buy above 93.09.
- **Invalidation:** 89.04
---
### BANC (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Confirmation/Decisive Down Bar

**Smart Money Logic:**
High volume (RelVol 1.10) on a wide bar closing extremely low (CLV -0.95). This confirms strong supply and a major reversal following the Monthly Buying Climax. Sellers are driving the price down forcefully.

**Key Levels:** 19.88 (Support), 21.61 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry below 19.88.
- **Invalidation:** 20.79
---
### BBT (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Upthrust/Effort No Result (Up)

**Smart Money Logic:**
A wide spread bar closed near the low (CLV -0.04), representing a strong rejection of the high (29.62). This Upthrust confirms supply dominance, consistent with the Monthly Buying Climax signal.

**Key Levels:** 27.00 (Support), 29.62 (Supply Zone)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on break below 27.00.
- **Invalidation:** 29.62
---
### BBWI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Confirmation/Weakness Bar

**Smart Money Logic:**
Low volume (RelVol 0.53) on a wide bar closing near the low (CLV -0.13) confirms that demand has disappeared, allowing supply to easily dominate the price action, validating the Monthly Supply Dominance signal.

**Key Levels:** 21.57 (Support), 23.27 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry below 21.57.
- **Invalidation:** 23.27
---
### BEP (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Demand at Resistance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Low volume (RelVol 0.69) rally attempt that closed poorly (CLV 0.16) indicates minimal demand and failure to push higher. This confirms supply remains dominant, favoring continuation of the bearish trend.

**Key Levels:** 27.47 (Support), 28.96 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on break below 27.47.
- **Invalidation:** 28.96
---
### BFH (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Confirmation/Decisive Down Bar

**Smart Money Logic:**
A wide spread down bar closing extremely low (CLV -0.91) on below-average volume confirms weakness. The buying power seen last week has evaporated, allowing supply to dominate and push the price aggressively toward the demand zone lows.

**Key Levels:** 67.77 (Support), 73.76 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry confirmed below 68.56.
- **Invalidation:** 73.73
---
### BHF (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
Low volume and narrow spread activity at resistance levels confirms No Demand. Smart Money is not interested in accumulating here, favoring the continuation of the Quarterly Bearish Trend.

**Key Levels:** 63.79 (Support), 64.69 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry below 63.79 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** 64.69
---
### BKKT (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Confirmation/Decisive Down Bar

**Smart Money Logic:**
Wide spread down bar closing low (CLV -0.72) confirms aggressive selling and the immediate rejection of the prior week's strength. Supply remains dominant, favoring continuation down.

**Key Levels:** 14.50 (Support), 19.78 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry below 14.50 on confirming volume.
- **Invalidation:** 16.37
---
### BNS (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply/Demand Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
Strong high close (CLV 0.89) on reduced volume (RelVol 0.86). This signals that supply has been cleared after the previous week's test, allowing the price to rally easily, suggesting renewed upward momentum in line with the Quarterly Bullish Trend.

**Key Levels:** 72.93 (Support), 74.98 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Buy on breakout above 74.98.
- **Invalidation:** 73.47
---
### BP (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Demand Confirmation/Strength

A strong high close (CLV 0.78) supported by above-average volume confirms renewed demand and successful continuation of the bullish move after a shakeout/test. Price is ready to challenge recent highs.

**Key Levels:** 35.02 (Support), 36.70 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Buy on breakout above 36.70.
- **Invalidation:** 35.38
---
### BRBR (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Demand Confirmation/Stopping Volume Reaction

**Smart Money Logic:**
Strong high close (CLV 0.66) on above-average volume confirms robust demand entering the market, overriding the short-term bearish pressure and suggesting potential accumulation against the Quarterly Bearish Trend.

**Key Levels:** 24.64 (Support), 28.26 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Buy on breakout above 28.26.
- **Invalidation:** 24.64
---
### BSY (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result (Up)/Weak Rally

**Smart Money Logic:**
Wide spread bar closing poorly (CLV 0.17) suggests institutional supply entered at 39.73, rejecting the rally. Demand is weak, favoring continuation of the bearish trend toward lower support levels.

**Key Levels:** 37.55 (Support), 40.65 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry below 38.72.
- **Invalidation:** 40.65
---
### BWIN (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Confirmation/Effort Down

**Smart Money Logic:**
High volume (RelVol 1.11) on a wide bar closing very low (CLV -0.75). This aggressive move down confirms that supply is overwhelming demand, likely leading to a break of recent support levels.

**Key Levels:** 24.88 (Support), 26.63 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry below 24.88.
- **Invalidation:** 26.63
---
### BXSL (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Confirmation/Weakness

**Smart Money Logic:**
The failure of the price to maintain high ground, resulting in a low close (CLV -0.59) on high volume, indicates supply re-entered the market and negated the prior week's bullish effort. Bearish continuation is expected.

**Key Levels:** 25.89 (Support), 26.64 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry below 25.89.
- **Invalidation:** 26.64
---
### CADE (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Confirmation/Decisive Down Bar

**Smart Money Logic:**
High volume (RelVol 1.43) on a wide bar closing extremely low (CLV -0.98). This suggests aggressive institutional distribution following a Buying Climax, overriding the Quarterly Bullish Trend for the short term.

**Key Levels:** 42.88 (Support), 46.74 (Resistance/Supply Zone)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry below 42.88 on confirming volume.
- **Invalidation:** 44.50
---
### CAI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Confirmation/Failure to Rally

**Smart Money Logic:**
High volume (RelVol 1.28) on a wide bar closing very low (CLV -0.76). This aggressive downside move negates the Stopping Volume signal and confirms persistent supply, likely pushing the price below the climax low (24.69).

**Key Levels:** 24.69 (Support/Climax Low), 26.78 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry below 24.73.
- **Invalidation:** 26.78
---
### CBRL (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Confirmation/Decisive Down Bar

**Smart Money Logic:**
Wide spread down bar closing extremely low (CLV -0.87) on below-average volume signals weak demand and aggressive selling pressure. The market is reversing sharply, confirming supply dominance.

**Key Levels:** 29.94 (Support), 34.27 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry below 29.94.
- **Invalidation:** 34.27
---
### CGON (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Down Bar on High Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence is flagged as SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (Watch for Test). The latest bar confirms this: very high volume (RelVol 1.89) but the bar closed significantly lower, in the bottom third (CLV -0.52), after making a new high ($57.88). This is a strong 'Effort No Result' or reversal bar, indicating heavy institutional selling (distribution) into strength. The subsequent down move on high volume is confirmation of Smart Money selling.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: $57.88 (Weekly High), Support: $52.51 (Last Weekly Low), Initial Entry Trigger: $53.11 (Last Open)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $52.51, confirming the bearish signal.
- **Invalidation:** Close above $57.88
---
### CMPO (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax Follow-through (Weakness)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly chart is flagged as a Buying Climax (Watch for Test). The prior week saw extreme volume (RelVol 3.55) on a very wide spread, but the latest bar, while still on high volume (RelVol 2.22), has a wide spread closing in the lower half (CLV -0.12) after failing to maintain a significantly higher high ($26.50). This volume is symptomatic of distribution after the climax. Smart Money is likely dumping shares into retail enthusiasm.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: $26.50 (Weekly High), Support: $24.09 (Last Weekly Low), Climax Pivot: $25.95

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $24.09, confirming distribution.
- **Invalidation:** Close above $26.50
---
### CNXC (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Test/No Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
The prior week showed Stopping Volume (RelVol 1.98) with a wide spread closing strongly (CLV 0.76), indicating absorption of supply near the lows ($37.85). The latest bar is on significantly lower volume (RelVol 0.84), showing a test of the supply with a moderate spread closing in the upper half (CLV 0.60). This low volume test confirms a lack of immediate selling pressure, setting up a potentially strong markup phase. This is a classic No Supply/Test signal following absorption.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: $44.78 (Recent High), Support: $39.99 (Last Weekly Low), Stopping Volume Low: $37.85

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close above $44.06 (Previous weekly close).
- **Invalidation:** Close below $39.99
---
### CORT (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Strength)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly context is Bearish, but the weekly sequence shows powerful reversal signals. The week before last was a down bar on extremely high volume (RelVol 2.34), reaching a low of $33.80, then closing near the high (CLV 0.84). This is classic Stopping Volume/Demand coming in. This bar confirms the absorption of prior massive selling. The market is attempting to reverse off a significant low.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: $44.84 (Weekly High), Support: $33.80 (Stopping Volume Low), Last Close: $43.98

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close above $44.84 (new weekly high), confirming momentum.
- **Invalidation:** Close below $37.43 (Previous weekly open)
---
### CPNG (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Down Bar on High Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly context is flagged as SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (Watch for Test). The latest bar is on high volume (RelVol 1.47) with a wide spread, closing near the absolute low (CLV -0.59). This confirms heavy selling pressure and distribution, pushing the price down. Despite a major volume spike two weeks ago (RelVol 2.07), the price failed to rally and continued its downtrend, suggesting that the effort to push prices lower succeeded (Effort Success).

**Key Levels:** Resistance: $21.14 (Last Weekly High), Support: $19.69 (Last Weekly Low), Initial Entry Trigger: $20.78 (Last Open)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $19.69, targeting further downside towards monthly lows.
- **Invalidation:** Close above $21.14
---
### ENR (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result (Supply Confirmation)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly context is Supply Dominance. The previous week was a strong reversal bar (CLV -0.71) following a high volume bar two weeks prior (CLV 0.99, RelVol 0.98), suggesting absorption failed and supply took over. The latest bar is on higher volume (RelVol 1.03) with a narrow spread, closing near the low (CLV -0.70). This confirms continued selling pressure, and the effort to hold price failed (Effort No Result). Smart Money is selling.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: $20.49 (Weekly High), Support: $19.63 (Weekly Low), Last Close: $19.76

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $19.63 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above $20.49
---
### EQH (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Test for Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly context is Supply Dominance. The previous week showed a significant drop on high volume (RelVol 0.96) with a poor close (CLV -0.67). The latest bar is on very high volume (RelVol 1.86) but has a narrow spread, closing in the lower half (CLV -0.36). This suggests institutional selling (distribution/churning) is continuing or being met by short-term demand, but the closing position is still weak despite the effort. The inability to rally substantially on this volume is bearish.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: $46.99 (Weekly High), Support: $45.00 (Weekly Low), Initial Entry Trigger: $46.00 (Last Open)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $45.00 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above $47.00
---
### FFIV (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result (Supply Confirmation)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly context is Stopping Volume (Watch for Test), typically bullish, but the recent weekly action suggests supply is present. The last bar is on average volume (RelVol 0.84) with a wide spread, closing near the low (CLV -0.59). This confirms a bearish reaction after two high-volume wide-spread bars failed to maintain strong closes. This indicates successful distribution by Smart Money.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: $267.41 (Weekly High), Support: $257.17 (Weekly Low), Last Close: $259.26

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $257.17, confirming the supply.
- **Invalidation:** Close above $267.41
---
### FISV (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Test/No Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly context is Supply Dominance, suggesting caution, but the weekly action is highly bullish. The previous week was a bearish reversal (CLV -0.82) on extremely high volume (RelVol 1.42), suggesting a possible Stopping Volume event, although the close was poor. The latest bar is a decisive reversal on high volume (RelVol 0.81) with a wide spread, closing near the high (CLV 0.96), essentially negating the prior week's weakness and signaling demand is overwhelming supply. This suggests a successful low volume test after the previous supply-heavy bar.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: $67.63 (Weekly High), Support: $64.18 (Weekly Low), Last Close: $67.56

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close above $67.63, confirming the markup.
- **Invalidation:** Close below $65.97 (Previous weekly low/support)
---
### FORM (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Down Bar on Extreme Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence is Supply Dominance (Watch for Test). The last bar exhibits extremely high volume (RelVol 1.97) on a very wide spread, closing near the absolute low (CLV -0.97). This is a text-book Effort No Result / Supply Dominance confirmation, indicating massive Smart Money distribution or a bearish climax, ending the short-term rally from $60 to $85. This is a powerful bearish signal.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: $85.49 (Weekly High), Support: $73.01 (Weekly Low), Initial Entry Trigger: $75.41 (Last Open)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $73.01, confirming the bearish signal. Target prior trading range.
- **Invalidation:** Close above $85.49
---
### FRPT (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort to Rise (Strength)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly context is Stopping Volume (Confirmed Early), a bullish reversal signal. The latest weekly bar is on high volume (RelVol 1.11) with a very wide spread, closing strongly near the high (CLV 0.70) and breaking out of the recent range by hitting $72.99. This confirms strong demand and accumulation. The price is moving into a strong markup phase, consistent with the reversal context.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: $72.99 (Weekly High/Breakout), Support: $63.48 (Weekly Low), Last Close: $71.55

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Pullback test to $68-$70 area, or a strong close above $73.00 if volume sustains.
- **Invalidation:** Close below $64.16 (Previous weekly open)
---
### FTAI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Extreme Volume)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence is Buying Climax (Watch for Test). The last bar is on extremely high volume (RelVol 2.02) with a huge spread ($45.99), closing in the upper half (CLV 0.22). While making a new high ($310.00), the closing position is poor relative to the wide spread, indicating significant supply entered the market (Effort No Result). This is a strong potential top, fueled by aggressive retail buying being met by institutional selling.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: $310.00 (Climax High), Support: $264.01 (Weekly Low), Last Close: $292.10

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $273.71 (Previous weekly close), confirming supply dominance.
- **Invalidation:** Close above $310.00
---
### GBCI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result (Supply Confirmation)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly context is Supply Dominance. The latest bar is on very high volume (RelVol 1.47) with a wide spread, but closed near the middle (CLV -0.32), failing to maintain the high of $50.92. This is a clear Effort No Result, signaling that Smart Money is selling into the rally. The high volume confirms institutional involvement, but the poor close indicates supply absorbed the demand.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: $50.92 (Weekly High), Support: $46.50 (Weekly Low), Last Close: $48.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $47.86 (Previous weekly close) on elevated volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above $50.92
---
### GE (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Down Bar on Extreme Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly context is Supply Dominance. The last bar is on extremely high volume (RelVol 2.28) with a wide spread, closing near the absolute low (CLV -0.78). This confirms strong Smart Money distribution/selling pressure, reversing the brief rally. This is a severe weakness signal, indicating a likely continuation of the bearish quarterly trend.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: $323.88 (Weekly High), Support: $290.07 (Weekly Low), Last Close: $293.87

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $290.07, confirming the trend continuation.

---
### GKOS (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax Follow-through (Weakness)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly context is Buying Climax. The previous week saw extreme volume (RelVol 1.25) and a massive spread, closing strongly (CLV 0.90), which was the climax. The latest bar is on high volume (RelVol 1.02) but has a narrow spread, closing poorly in the lower third (CLV -0.71), after failing to hold the high ($130.23). This is a clear sign of Supply absorbing demand, confirming the distribution hinted at by the Buying Climax.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: $130.23 (Weekly High), Support: $118.26 (Weekly Low), Last Close: $119.98

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $118.26 on elevated volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above $130.23
---
### GWRE (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Strength)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is bearish, but the weekly shows signs of reversal (Supply Dominance was flagged, suggesting potential bearish continuity, but the latest bar contradicts this). Last week was a massive down bar on high volume (RelVol 1.95) closing near the low (CLV -0.99), indicating a potential Selling Climax. The latest bar, on comparable volume (RelVol 1.89), has a narrow spread but closed strongly in the upper half (CLV 0.74). This is a strong immediate reaction (Stopping Volume) showing demand absorption at the low ($154.51).

**Key Levels:** Resistance: $160.85 (Weekly High), Support: $154.51 (Stopping Volume Low), Last Close: $160.03

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close above $160.85, confirming the rebound.

---
### HPE (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence is Stopping Volume (Watch for Test) in a Bearish Quarterly Trend. The previous week saw high volume (RelVol 0.52) with a wide spread closing poorly (CLV -0.97), potentially indicating a selling climax. The latest bar is on high volume (RelVol 0.59) with a wide spread, closing in the upper half (CLV 0.05) after testing below the previous week's low. This suggests absorption of remaining supply and a successful reaction off the extreme low ($20.08). Demand is entering.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: $21.93 (Weekly High), Support: $20.08 (Stopping Volume Low), Last Close: $21.05

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close above $21.44 (Previous weekly close).

---
### IMAX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Confirmation / Down Bar on Average Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly context is Stopping Volume (Watch for Test), suggesting a potential bottom, but the latest weekly action is highly bearish. The last bar is on average volume (RelVol 0.90) with a wide spread, closing poorly near the low (CLV -0.83). This signals supply is overwhelming demand, failing the potential bullish reversal indicated by the Stopping Volume the week prior. The price action suggests continued markdown.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: $37.86 (Weekly High), Support: $34.30 (Weekly Low), Last Close: $34.61

#### Action Plan

The weekly sequence is Supply Dominance (Watch for Test). The last bar exhibits massive, extreme volume (RelVol 2.10) on a wide spread, closing poorly near the low (CLV -0.88). This is a definitive sign of Smart Money distribution at the top, effectively negating the previous strong markup phase. This is a highly bearish signal consistent with the flagged Supply Dominance pattern.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: $54.60 (Weekly High), Support: $44.45 (Weekly Low), Last Close: $45.07

#### Action Plan

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly context is confirmed Buying Climax, suggesting distribution. The last bar is on high volume (RelVol 0.81) with a wide spread, closing in the lower half (CLV -0.64) after attempting a new high ($54.24). This is a clear Effort No Result, confirming that supply is entering the market heavily. The failure to maintain the high despite the volume signals institutional selling.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: $54.24 (Weekly High), Support: $45.69 (Weekly Low), Last Close: $47.25

The monthly context is Buying Climax (Watch for Test) in a Bearish Quarterly Trend. The last bar is on high volume (RelVol 1.16) with a narrow spread, closing poorly in the lower half (CLV -0.34). This suggests churning and failure to gain ground, confirming supply dominance (Effort No Result). The price is failing to recover substantially after the large volume bar two weeks ago that saw a mid-range close (CLV 0.38).

**Key Levels:** Resistance: $33.82 (Weekly High), Support: $31.25 (Weekly Low), Last Close: $32.10

---
### MOD (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Strength)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence is Stopping Volume (Watch for Test) in a Bearish Quarterly Trend. The last two weeks suggest demand entry. The latest bar is on average volume (RelVol 0.79) with a wide spread, closing in the upper half (CLV 0.47) and moving away from the extreme low ($111.18). This confirms the demand that entered two weeks ago (Stopping Volume event) is now pushing the price higher. This is a strong bullish reversal signal.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: $150.75 (Weekly High), Support: $132.80 (Weekly Low), Last Close: $145.99

---
### OC (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Absorption/Continuation

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly context is BULLISH. The Monthly sequence is STOPPING_VOLUME (Nov/Dec 2025, although CLV was negative in Dec, the range was tight after the prior wide Nov bar). January 2026 Monthly bar is a strong close (CLV 0.70) on average volume. The last two weekly bars are up bars closing mid-to-high, suggesting continuing demand. The last weekly bar (01-19) is wide spread up, medium CLV (0.278) on average volume, consolidating near highs, suggesting potential pause before mark-up. Strength confirmed by rally off prior low volume test area.

**Key Levels:** 121.56 (Prior Weekly High Support), 126.92 (Recent High/Target), 119.91 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Clear break and hold above 127.00 or tight spread/low volume pullback near 124.00.

### OKLO (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (BC) & Secondary Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BEARISH. The Monthly chart confirms a BUYING_CLIMAX in January 2026 (wide spread, high volume up move (97M shares) followed by subsequent down weeks). The last two weekly bars (01-12 and 01-19) are wide spread down bars, with the last bar closing low (CLV -0.77) on average volume. This confirms smart money distribution/supply dominance following the climax event. The market is struggling below the 100 level, indicating weakness.

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and hold below 86.00 with increased volume confirmation.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 100.20
---
### QTWO (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume/Demand Return

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BEARISH, but the recent weekly action suggests a shift. The 01-12 week was a shakeout/Selling Climax (wide spread down, high volume, low CLV -0.92). The last weekly bar (01-19) is a wide spread up bar, closing at the absolute high (CLV 0.957) on high relative volume (0.72x average). This is a strong signal of Demand returning, likely stopping the prior downtrend, despite the Monthly SUPPLY_DOMINANCE context. Smart money is stepping in at 63.50 area.

**Key Levels:** 68.59 (Immediate Resistance), 63.44 (Stopping Volume Low/Support), 70.24 (Next Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Tight spread/low volume test near 67.00, or a clear break above 68.60.

---
### RF (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance/Effort No Result Down

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the monthly chart shows SUPPLY_DOMINANCE watch. The last weekly bar (01-19) is a wide spread down bar, closing very low (CLV -0.735) on high volume (0.79x). This is a clear signal of supply overwhelming demand. It failed to hold the prior week's low (27.34), confirming short-term weakness. This price action suggests distribution despite the overall bullish context, likely seeking lower support levels.

**Key Levels:** 28.99 (Resistance), 27.25 (Immediate Support/Weekly Low), 27.77 (Prior Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and hold below 27.25 on high volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 28.00
---
### RGLD (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Strength Confirmed (Confirmed Mark-Up)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BULLISH. The Monthly chart confirms a strong move up (CLV 0.97) following prior accumulation (Dec 2025). The last two weekly bars (01-12 and 01-19) are exceptionally strong: wide spread up, closing near the high (CLV > 0.93) on strong, consistent volume. This indicates smart money is actively marking up the price. The move from 223 to 293 in two weeks shows powerful demand with minimal opposition near the highs.

**Key Levels:** 293.99 (Recent High/Target), 265.70 (Immediate Support), 248.08 (Strong Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Tight consolidation or shallow pullback to 275-280 range with No Supply signals, or a decisive break above 294.

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BEARISH. The Monthly chart confirms a potential BUYING_CLIMAX failure (Jan CLV -0.70). The recent weekly price action shows weakness. The 01-05 week had high volume and a low close (CLV -0.68), indicating heavy selling. The subsequent weeks saw poor bounces (01-12 test, CLV -0.008) followed by a final wide spread down bar (01-19), closing low (CLV -0.485) on extremely high volume (1.75x). This confirms the bears are in control and the prior Buying Climax was merely a reaction in a downtrend.

**Key Levels:** 60.35 (Resistance), 55.80 (Weekly Low/Target), 62.00 (Prior Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and hold below 55.80 on high volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 60.50
---
### RTO (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Confirmed Demand)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BULLISH. Weekly chart confirms STOPPING_VOLUME. The last two weekly bars are very strong. The 01-12 week saw high volume (1.91x) but closed midrange, suggesting absorption. The 01-19 week is a wide spread up bar, closing near the high (CLV 0.839) on extremely high volume (2.89x). This confirms powerful demand and continuation of the bullish trend. The high volume confirms smart money participation in the mark-up phase, overcoming minor resistance near 32.00.

**Key Levels:** 33.13 (New High/Target), 30.76 (Immediate Support), 31.54 (Prior High Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Pullback to 32.00 or tight consolidation near 33.00 with low volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 30.70
---
### SA (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Strength Confirmed (Breakout)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BULLISH. The Monthly chart shows strong Jan action (CLV 0.65). The last weekly bar (01-19) is a massive wide spread up bar, closing high (CLV 0.48) on high relative volume (1.23x). This bar breaks out decisively from the prior weeks of consolidation (30-32 range). This confirms strong demand and absorption of supply previously seen near the 32.00 level. Smart money is initiating a mark-up.

**Key Levels:** 37.99 (New High/Target), 31.75 (Breakout Support), 30.86 (Prior Resistance/Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Shallow pullback to 35.00 or tight consolidation with No Supply signals.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 31.70
---
### SPOT (NEUTRAL/BULLISH Watch)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax/Demand Return

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BEARISH, but the recent action is highly volatile. The last two weekly bars saw extremely high volume (1.94x and 1.59x). The 01-12 week was a wide spread down bar, closing near the low (CLV -0.84), potentially a selling climax/shakeout. The last bar (01-19) is a wide spread up bar, closing high (CLV 0.70) on high volume. This indicates strong demand returning immediately after the shakeout near 491.00. This is a classic spring action, suggesting accumulation, despite the Monthly SUPPLY_DOMINANCE context.

**Key Levels:** 517.00 (Immediate Resistance), 491.30 (Selling Climax Low/Support), 548.55 (Next Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and hold above 517.00, or a low volume test near 500.00.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 491.00
---
### STAA (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax/Failure to Rally

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BEARISH. Weekly confirms STOPPING_VOLUME, but the bounce failed. The 01-05 week was a likely selling climax (wide spread, high volume). However, the subsequent weeks (01-12 and 01-19) showed weak follow-through demand. The last bar (01-19) is a wide spread down bar, closing at the absolute low (CLV -0.927) on high volume (1.15x). This aggressive low close after the initial stopping volume suggests the market failed to accumulate and the supply overwhelmed any temporary demand, confirming bearish continuation.

**Key Levels:** 21.27 (Immediate Resistance), 19.06 (New Low/Support), 20.64 (Prior Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and hold below 19.06 with high volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 20.00
---
### TFX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Confirmed)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BEARISH. Weekly confirms SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The 01-05 week initiated a steep drop (wide spread down, high volume, low CLV -0.53). The 01-12 week confirmed weakness (wide spread down, high volume, CLV -0.93). The last weekly bar (01-19) attempts a bounce (up bar, mid-range close CLV -0.06), but on high volume (1.29x). This bounce failed to gather momentum, turning into an Effort No Result Down (indicated by the mid-range close despite high volume). This is a strong confirmation of persistent supply dominance and mark-down phase.

**Key Levels:** 107.06 (Resistance), 100.18 (Immediate Support/Weekly Low), 103.00 (Prior Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and hold below 100.18 on confirming volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 107.00
---
### WRB (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Confirmed)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BEARISH. Monthly chart is on SUPPLY_DOMINANCE watch. The last two weekly bars confirm weakness. The 01-12 bar was a wide spread down bar, closing very low (CLV -0.71) on average volume. The last bar (01-19) attempts a small rally but closes mid-low (CLV -0.318) on above-average volume (1.08x). This suggests the up move was met with supply, preventing a meaningful rally (Effort No Result Down). The consistent negative CLV and downward pressure confirms supply is in control.

**Key Levels:** 68.32 (Immediate Resistance), 66.50 (Immediate Support/Weekly Low), 69.78 (Previous High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and hold below 66.50 on increased volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 68.50
---
## 👀 Watch/Monitoring
### ABT (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax/Effort Down

**Smart Money Logic:**
Extreme high volume (RelVol 3.14) on a very wide down bar closing near the low (CLV -0.80). This confirms immense supply/distribution entering the market, consistent with the Quarterly Bearish Trend. Expect immediate short-term weakness, possibly leading to an Automatic Rally defining a trading range bottom.

**Key Levels:** 105.77 (Support/Climax Low), 121.14 (Short-term Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for confirmation of weakness (e.g., failed rally/No Demand) near 110.00 or a strong test of 105.77.
- **Invalidation:** 120.92
---
### ABVX (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Potential Test/Reaction

**Smart Money Logic:**
Following two weeks of intense selling volume (RelVol ~1.8-1.9) and low closes, the most recent week showed lower volume (RelVol 0.77) and a close slightly off the lows. This suggests supply pressure may be temporarily easing, but major demand confirmation is pending.

**Key Levels:** 113.63 (Support), 130.13 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** High volume rally breaking 126.00 or a low volume pullback to 115.00.
- **Invalidation:** 113.63
---
### ACLX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort Down/Supply Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
High relative volume (1.70) on a wide bar that failed to close strong (CLV -0.67). Significant supply absorbed demand near the high (76.50), confirming the Monthly Supply Dominance.

**Key Levels:** 63.33 (Demand Zone), 76.50 (Resistance/Supply Line)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Look for No Supply test near 64.00.
- **Invalidation:** 76.50
---
### ACN (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result (Up)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Price action suggests rejection at higher levels (289.00). The last bar had a wide spread but closed near the low on reduced volume (RelVol 0.87), indicating that professional selling entered or demand dried up, signaling short-term weakness/pullback.

**Key Levels:** 272.22 (Support), 289.00 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Look for No Supply confirmation near 275.00.
- **Invalidation:** 291.08
---
### AEO (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Strong Supply/Decisive Down Bar

**Smart Money Logic:**
The bar closed extremely low (CLV -0.95), showing sellers were in absolute control despite moderate volume. This confirms the current weakness implied by the Monthly Buying Climax, suggesting distribution is active.

**Key Levels:** 23.87 (Support), 26.69 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for No Demand/Upthrust confirmation if a small rally occurs.
- **Invalidation:** 26.69
---
### AEVA (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Confirmation (AR Continuation)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The extreme Selling pressure (CLV -0.98) on high volume confirms the bearish reaction following the major Buying Climax earlier in January. Smart Money is distributing, and the price is likely to test lower demand levels (Secondary Test).

**Key Levels:** 15.76 (Immediate Support), 22.62 (Primary Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry confirmation if subsequent rally fails the 18.00 level on low volume (No Demand).
- **Invalidation:** 22.62
---
### AIG (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Test of Demand (Weakness)

**Smart Money Logic:**
After major Selling Climax events (Jan 5/12), the subsequent low volume bar closed weakly (CLV -0.12). This signifies that demand has not yet stepped in strongly, and supply remains dominant, likely leading to a break of recent support.

**Key Levels:** 71.24 (Support), 75.43 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry below 71.24 on confirming volume.
- **Invalidation:** 75.43
---
### AL (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** No Demand at Highs

**Smart Money Logic:**
Extremely narrow spread and low volume at high prices signal lack of buyer commitment (No Demand). Coupled with the Monthly Buying Climax, this suggests distribution or an inevitable pullback is near.

**Key Levels:** 64.27 (Support), 64.47 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry confirmed below 64.15.
- **Invalidation:** 64.47
---
### AMBA (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Weak Rally/Supply Loitering

**Smart Money Logic:**
Volume decreased (RelVol 0.84) indicating temporary selling exhaustion, but the closing location remains weak (CLV -0.36). This shows weak demand unable to sustain a rally, maintaining the bearish pressure within the established trend.

**Key Levels:** 65.23 (Support), 71.40 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break of 65.23 (Short) or break of 71.40 (Long, counter-trend).
- **Invalidation:** 71.40
---
### AMH (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result (Up)

**Smart Money Logic:**
High volume (RelVol 1.12) on a narrow spread, coupled with a poor close (CLV 0.07), indicates supply entered near the high (32.40), stalling the markup phase initiated last week. Expect a short-term correction to test demand.

**Key Levels:** 31.50 (Support), 32.40 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Look for No Supply confirmation near 31.50.
- **Invalidation:** 32.40
---
### AMZU (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Secondary Test of Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
The price achieved a strong rally and closed high (CLV 0.80) after touching the lows, indicating robust demand response. This is a potential accumulation signal (Secondary Test) forming a temporary bottom against the quarterly bearish trend.

**Key Levels:** 33.43 (Support), 40.40 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 40.40 on high volume.
- **Invalidation:** 33.43
---
### ARM (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume/Demand Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
Very high volume (RelVol 1.90) on a wide bar that successfully rallied off the low (104.41). This heavy turnover represents institutional absorption of supply, confirming a potential reversal and accumulation phase against the bearish quarterly trend.

**Key Levels:** 104.41 (Support), 123.50 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a low volume pullback/test (No Supply) towards 110.00.
- **Invalidation:** 104.41
---
### ARWR (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Weak Rally/Effort No Result

**Smart Money Logic:**
The rally attempt saw absorption near 71.16, resulting in a low close (CLV 0.13) on below-average volume. Supply pressure confirmed by the weekly sequence is still holding prices down, contradicting the Quarterly Bullish context.

**Key Levels:** 61.65 (Support), 71.16 (Supply Zone)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 61.65 (Short) or strong break above 71.16 (Long).
- **Invalidation:** 71.16
---
### AVAV (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax/Automatic Reaction

**Smart Money Logic:**
Extreme wide spread down and very low close (CLV -0.82) on high volume (RelVol 1.59). This confirms aggressive supply entered the market, initiating the Automatic Reaction phase after the high was established, signaling distribution.

**Key Levels:** 300.00 (Support/Reaction Low), 408.25 (Supply Zone)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a weak rally (No Demand) towards 350.00 to potentially short, targeting 300.00 re-test.
- **Invalidation:** 392.85
---
### AXTA (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result (Up)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Price action suggests rejection at the high (34.20), closing poorly (CLV 0.19) on lower volume (RelVol 0.72). This signals a lack of demand follow-through following the previous strong bar, indicating short-term weakness/pullback.

**Key Levels:** 32.79 (Support), 34.20 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for No Supply test near 33.00.
- **Invalidation:** 34.20
---
### BABX (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result (Up)/Upthrust

**Smart Money Logic:**
Price printed a new high but closed poorly (CLV 0.15) on near-average volume. This reflects institutional supply absorbing buying pressure at the high (53.34), confirming the weakness signaled by the Monthly Supply Dominance.

**Key Levels:** 42.81 (Support), 53.34 (Resistance/Supply)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry below 42.81 on confirming volume.
- **Invalidation:** 53.34
---
### BAH (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax/Effort No Result (Up)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Very high volume (RelVol 1.50) on the widest spread, closing poorly (CLV 0.13). This is textbook Buying Climax/Distribution. Smart Money absorbed all demand above 102.00. Expect an Automatic Reaction downward to define range support.

**Key Levels:** 93.27 (Support), 109.09 (Supply Zone)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on weak rally or break below 97.40.
- **Invalidation:** 109.09
---
### BBIO (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result (Up)/Supply Absorption

**Smart Money Logic:**
Volume remained high (RelVol 1.06) on a wide bar that failed to close strong (CLV 0.08). This signifies significant supply absorption near 81.32, indicating the rally attempt following Stopping Volume has stalled. Expect a pullback.

**Key Levels:** 73.76 (Support), 81.32 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Look for No Supply confirmation near 75.00.
- **Invalidation:** 81.32
---
### BE (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result (Up)/Upthrust

**Smart Money Logic:**
Wide spread bar closed poorly (CLV -0.21) on below-average volume (RelVol 0.77). This shows supply entering the market near 155.86, stalling the aggressive markup phase. Expect short-term weakness/pullback.

**Key Levels:** 137.75 (Support), 155.86 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for No Supply test near 140.00.
- **Invalidation:** 155.86
---
### BKSY (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result (Up)/Upthrust

**Smart Money Logic:**
The price action suggests rejection at the high (29.46). Wide spread with low CLV (0.14) on reduced volume confirms that demand is drying up and supply is absorbing strength, aligning with the Monthly Buying Climax.

**Key Levels:** 23.89 (Support), 29.46 (Resistance/Supply Zone)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry below 27.53.
- **Invalidation:** 29.79
---
### BRKR (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result (Up)/Supply Absorption

**Smart Money Logic:**
The rally attempt following the Selling Climax failed dramatically, closing near the low (CLV 0.05) despite a wide range. This points to aggressive supply absorption near 53.50, suggesting a necessary pullback to re-test demand.

**Key Levels:** 46.81 (Support), 53.50 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a low volume test near 48.00.
- **Invalidation:** 53.50
---
### BRZE (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Automatic Rally

**Smart Money Logic:**
High volume rally (RelVol 1.36) following a Selling Climax, confirming the initial bounce off the low (22.65). This is the Automatic Rally (AR), establishing the top of the short-term trading range. Expect resistance tests soon.

**Key Levels:** 22.65 (Support/Climax Low), 26.16 (AR High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for confirmation of range boundaries.
- **Invalidation:** 22.65
---
### CALM (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result (Up)/Supply Absorption

**Smart Money Logic:**
High volume rally failed to close strongly (CLV 0.35), indicating supply absorption near 82.80. This suggests the Automatic Rally phase is consolidating, and the market is preparing for a Secondary Test within the newly defined trading range.

**Key Levels:** 75.72 (Support), 82.80 (Resistance/Supply Zone)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for No Demand confirmation near 81.00.
- **Invalidation:** 82.80
---
### CBSH (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last week shows very high volume (RelVol 1.32) on a wide spread bar that closed in the lower third (CLV -0.85). This is a strong sign of Supply/Selling Pressure coming in after an attempt to reach highs ($56.06). The rally attempt failed, resulting in a poor close, indicating Smart Money distribution at the top of the short-term trading range. The monthly context is also Supply Dominance (Watch for Test), reinforcing the bearish outlook.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: $56.06 (Weekly High), Support: $51.47 (Monthly Low), Last Close: $53.21

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $52.24 (Previous weekly close support) on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above $56.06
---
### CCOI (NEUTRAL/BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax Follow-through (Weakness)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly context is a confirmed Buying Climax, suggesting a potential shift in trend, although the last weekly bar is not excessively high volume (RelVol 0.45) and closed mid-range (CLV 0.33) after making a new high ($25.05). This suggests weakness is still present following the prior high volume bars, but the immediate selling pressure eased slightly. The stock is holding near recent highs, but the overall monthly warning remains relevant. Need confirmation of selling.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: $25.05 (Weekly High), Support: $22.79 (Last Weekly Low), Key Support: $20.50 (Prior weekly low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $22.79 signaling distribution continuation.
- **Invalidation:** New weekly high closing strongly above $25.05
---
### CELC (NEUTRAL/BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort to Rise (Weakness)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar shows high volume (RelVol 0.80) on a wide spread bar closing in the upper half (CLV 0.45). While the close is positive, the prior two weeks had extremely wide spreads and high volume, with the previous week's close being negative (CLV -0.18) after hitting new highs ($116.44). The volume suggests persistent institutional interest, but the huge spike and failure to maintain the close near the absolute high ($116.44) indicates potential Supply Dominance (which is also the monthly context). The stock is consolidating the spike volume.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: $116.44 (Weekly High), Support: $103.00 (Last Weekly Low), Last Close: $110.05

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $107.00 on increasing volume for a bearish confirmation.
- **Invalidation:** Strong weekly close above $116.44
---
### CNQ (NEUTRAL/BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Failed Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly chart detected Stopping Volume, however, the latest bar on slightly below average volume (RelVol 0.97) closed very strongly near the high (CLV 0.87), making a new high ($36.28). This movement suggests the stopping volume effect from two weeks ago ($30.13 low on RelVol 2.05) has been overcome, and demand is currently controlling the price. The bearish Stopping Volume context needs to be ignored for now as demand has pushed the price higher. If the next bar fails to hold these gains, the VSA context may flip.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: $36.28 (Weekly High), Support: $34.10 (Last Weekly Low), Stopping Volume Low: $30.13

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Strong weekly close above $36.28 for bullish continuation, or sharp reversal below $35.00 for bearish signal.
- **Invalidation:** Close below $34.10
---
### CRBG (NEUTRAL/BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax Follow-through (Weakness)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly context is confirmed Buying Climax, a bearish signal in a Bearish Quarterly Trend. The last five weekly bars have decreasing spread and volume (RelVol 0.81), indicating loss of momentum. The latest bar is on below-average volume and has a narrow spread closing near mid-range (CLV 0.04). This suggests a quiet period of consolidation/churning near the top of the short-term range, likely pausing before the next down move, confirming the Buying Climax thesis.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: $31.50 (Recent High), Support: $29.35 (Last Weekly Low), Last Close: $30.05

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $29.35 on elevated volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above $30.70 (last week's high)
---
### CSGP (NEUTRAL/BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort to Rise (Weakness/Supply)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence is Supply Dominance (Watch for Test). The last bar is on high volume (RelVol 1.40) but the spread is moderate, closing in the upper half (CLV 0.12). This follows a sharp reversal bar two weeks ago (Stopping Volume/Demand at the low, CLV 0.87, RelVol 2.17). The current bar shows a struggle to maintain upward momentum despite the volume, suggesting supply is capping the recovery. The overall trend is Bearish, making supply signals more potent.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: $67.79 (Weekly High), Support: $62.81 (Last Weekly Low), Last Close: $65.60

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $62.81 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above $67.79
---
### CTRA (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax Follow-through (Weakness)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly chart is flagged as a Buying Climax (Watch for Test). Two weeks ago featured extremely high volume (RelVol 2.08) on a wide spread closing poorly (CLV -0.46), confirming the climax. The latest bar is on average volume (RelVol 0.94) with a medium spread closing strongly (CLV 0.58), suggesting a bounce/minor effort to push higher. Given the market is Bullish, this bounce is expected, but the previous volume event signals serious supply. This bounce needs to be monitored for failure.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: $27.80 (Weekly High), Support: $26.00 (Last Weekly Low), Climax Pivot: $28.48

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Failure of the rally confirmed by a close below $26.00.
- **Invalidation:** Close above $27.80
---
### DOW (NEUTRAL/BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort to Rise (Weakness)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly context is Supply Dominance. The last two weekly bars show diminishing positive momentum. The latest bar is on average volume (RelVol 0.87), a wide spread, but closed in the middle (CLV 0.39), failing to approach the high made the previous week ($28.52). This divergence between the wide spread and the mediocre close suggests supply is meeting the demand (Effort No Result), likely due to the underlying monthly weakness.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: $29.09 (Weekly High), Support: $26.31 (Last Weekly Low), Last Close: $28.25

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $27.57 (Previous weekly close) on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above $29.09
---
### DUOL (NEUTRAL/BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is bearish, and the monthly is Supply Dominance. However, two weeks ago saw massive selling pressure resulting in a huge down bar closing near the low (CLV -0.78), indicating a possible climax. The latest bar, on high volume (RelVol 1.18), has a wide spread and closed strongly in the upper half (CLV 0.45), testing the recent lows ($142.10) and showing an immediate positive reaction. This is a potential initial sign of demand entering the market after the washout, fitting a stopping volume scenario, even if the label wasn't applied previously.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: $161.28 (Weekly High), Support: $142.10 (Stopping Volume Low), Last Close: $155.98

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A subsequent low volume test of $150 or a strong close above $161.28.
- **Invalidation:** Close below $142.10
---
### FER (NEUTRAL/BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort to Rise (Weakness)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly context is Supply Dominance. The last week featured average volume (RelVol 0.96) and a wide spread, closing mid-range (CLV 0.28). This followed a strong up bar that closed high (CLV 0.66) the week prior. The latest action suggests hesitancy and potential resistance near the $68.54 high. Given the underlying monthly Supply Dominance, this is likely an indication that supply is beginning to re-assert itself after the short-term rally.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: $68.54 (Recent High), Support: $65.55 (Last Weekly Low), Last Close: $67.04

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $66.61 (Previous weekly open) on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above $68.54
---
### FIBK (NEUTRAL/BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result (Weakness)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly context is Buying Climax (Watch for Test). The latest bar is on average volume (RelVol 0.86) with a wide spread, but closed in the lower half (CLV -0.50) after attempting a new high ($38.78). This is a bearish 'Effort No Result' indicating that significant selling is appearing near the highs, despite the bull market context. The underlying weakness from the monthly Buying Climax is now manifesting weekly.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: $38.78 (Weekly High), Support: $35.95 (Weekly Low), Last Close: $36.66

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $35.95 on elevated volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above $38.78
---
### GNTX (NEUTRAL/BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result (Weakness)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly context is Supply Dominance. The latest bar is on high volume (RelVol 1.02) with a narrow spread, closing in the lower half (CLV -0.35). This follows a previous high-volume bar that also closed poorly (CLV -0.02). The high volume suggests continued selling pressure or churning at the highs ($24.53), confirming the underlying supply dominance, despite the Bullish Quarterly trend. Effort to rise is failing.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: $24.11 (Weekly High), Support: $23.34 (Weekly Low), Last Close: $23.59

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $23.34.
- **Invalidation:** Close above $24.11
---
### HDB (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Test for Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly context is Supply Dominance. The last week featured high volume (RelVol 1.51) and a narrow spread, closing mid-range (CLV 0.09). This followed a massive down bar two weeks prior (RelVol 2.88, CLV -0.91), signaling heavy institutional selling. The current bar is a small rally attempt on high volume, failing to move substantially higher, indicating persistent supply overhead and confirming the dominance of the sellers.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: $32.66 (Weekly High), Support: $31.34 (Weekly Low), Last Close: $32.06

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $31.34.
- **Invalidation:** Close above $32.66
---
### HRMY (NEUTRAL/BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort to Rise (Weakness)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly context is Supply Dominance. The previous week was a bearish reversal bar on high volume (RelVol 1.04) closing poorly (CLV -0.35). The latest bar is on below-average volume (RelVol 0.66) with a moderate spread, closing mid-range (CLV 0.48). This suggests a weak attempt at recovery, likely a low-volume test of supply that failed to clear the overhead pressure signaled by the monthly context and the prior weekly reversal.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: $37.41 (Weekly High), Support: $35.16 (Weekly Low), Last Close: $36.82

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $36.22 (Previous weak close).
- **Invalidation:** Close above $37.41
---
### INVH (NEUTRAL/BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Test for Supply (Weakness)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence is Stopping Volume, but the quarterly trend is bearish. The latest bar is on below-average volume (RelVol 0.88) with a narrow spread, closing mid-range (CLV -0.40). This follows a sharp reversal bar the week prior (CLV 0.99) that tested the recent low. The lack of follow-through and the weak close on the current bar suggests supply is still present and capping the potential rally, failing the test. The bearish trend context remains dominant.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: $27.78 (Weekly High), Support: $26.94 (Weekly Low), Stopping Volume Low: $25.29

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $26.94.
- **Invalidation:** Close above $27.78
---
### IREN (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Effort to Rise (Strength/Weakness Divergence)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly context is Supply Dominance, but the recent weekly action is extremely strong. The previous week was very high volume (RelVol 1.20), wide spread, closing strongly near the high (CLV 0.86), indicating demand. The latest bar is on even higher volume (RelVol 1.30), a wide spread, closing in the upper half (CLV 0.61). While this is technically bullish strength, the high volume in a Supply Dominance context and the failure to close near the high ($58.58) suggests that supply is aggressively meeting the demand. A potential short-term top is forming.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: $58.58 (Weekly High), Support: $48.83 (Weekly Low), Last Close: $56.68

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Failure to sustain price above $58.58, followed by a close below $54.95 (Last Open).
- **Invalidation:** Close above $60.00
---
### ITT (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Test for Supply (Weakness)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly context is Supply Dominance in a Bearish Quarterly Trend. The latest bar is on average volume (RelVol 0.93) with a wide spread, closing mid-range (CLV 0.01). This test follows a strong up bar two weeks ago (CLV 0.71) that broke the recent downtrend. The inability of the price to sustain momentum on the current bar suggests that supply is present (failing the test), maintaining the overall structural weakness indicated by the monthly context.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: $187.65 (Weekly High), Support: $178.49 (Weekly Low), Last Close: $183.15

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close below $178.49 on rising volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above $187.65
---
### KDP (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Test for Supply (Weakness)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly context is Buying Climax. The latest bar is on average volume (RelVol 0.73) with a narrow spread, closing mid-range (CLV 0.31). This follows a poor close the previous week (CLV -0.83), suggesting persistent weakness. The current bar is a small range bar on lower volume, unable to establish strong upward momentum or decisively break away from the recent churn area. This confirms that the market is currently balanced or slightly supply-dominated near the highs.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: $28.12 (Weekly High), Support: $27.08 (Weekly Low), Last Close: $27.76

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close below $27.08 on increasing volume, confirming distribution.
- **Invalidation:** Close above $28.16 (Previous weekly high)
---
### KEY (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Test for Supply (Weakness)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly context is Supply Dominance. The last week featured high volume (RelVol 0.90) on a wide spread, but closed mid-range (CLV -0.02) after touching a high of $22.07. This is a clear indication that supply is readily available at these levels, capping the rally attempt. Given the Supply Dominance context, this neutral close on high volume leans bearish.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: $22.07 (Weekly High), Support: $20.17 (Weekly Low), Last Close: $21.10

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $20.56 (Last Open).
- **Invalidation:** Close above $22.07
---
### KYMR (NEUTRAL/BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort to Rise (Weakness)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly context is Buying Climax. The latest bar is on average volume (RelVol 0.79) with a moderate spread, closing mid-range (CLV 0.12). This follows two consecutive bearish bars that closed near their lows, indicating persistent selling. The current bar's failure to strongly reverse confirms supply is controlling the market structure at this consolidation level. The Buying Climax signal is being confirmed by the price weakness.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: $72.86 (Weekly High), Support: $66.21 (Weekly Low), Last Close: $69.93

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $66.21.
- **Invalidation:** Close above $72.86
---
### LHX (NEUTRAL/BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax Follow-through (Weakness)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence is Buying Climax (Watch for Test). The last two weeks saw high volume (RelVol 2.09, 1.38) and wide spreads, with the previous week showing a poor close (CLV -0.05) after hitting $361.59. The latest bar, while closing in the upper half (CLV 0.42), failed to reach the previous high on high volume. This indicates significant churning near the top and suggests supply is entering the market, confirming the climax scenario.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: $361.59 (Weekly High), Support: $340.28 (Weekly Low), Last Close: $354.73

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close below $340.28 on elevated volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above $361.59
---
### LQDA (NEUTRAL/BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort to Rise (Strength/Weakness Divergence)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly context is confirmed Supply Dominance, suggesting caution. However, the latest weekly bar is on average volume (RelVol 0.90), wide spread, closing well in the upper half (CLV 0.22) after reaching a new high ($42.46). This is an ambiguous bar. While volume is slightly decreasing (a good sign for accumulation), the failure to close near the high after the wide spread suggests overhead supply is still capping the move, aligning with the monthly bearish context. Needs bullish confirmation.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: $42.46 (Weekly High), Support: $37.67 (Weekly Low), Last Close: $40.59

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Strong close above $42.46, overcoming the overhead supply.
- **Invalidation:** Close below $37.67
---
### MAN (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Test for Supply (Weakness)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly context is Supply Dominance. The latest bar is on average volume (RelVol 0.83), wide spread, closing slightly above mid-range (CLV 0.31). This follows a previous high volume bar that closed poorly (CLV -0.39). The current action suggests an attempt to rally, but the volume is lower and the close is unconvincing, indicating supply remains active overhead, making this a failed test or a weak recovery attempt.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: $31.54 (Weekly High), Support: $28.83 (Weekly Low), Last Close: $30.60

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $29.43 (Last Open).
- **Invalidation:** Close above $31.54
---
### NFXL (NEUTRAL/BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Selling Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence is Stopping Volume (Watch for Test) in a Bearish Quarterly Trend. The last bar is on extremely high volume (RelVol 3.75) with a very wide spread, closing mid-range (CLV -0.01). This massive volume and wide range strongly suggests a Selling Climax, where panic selling by weak holders is met by aggressive institutional buying (accumulation). The mid-range close indicates a tug-of-war, but the extreme volume near the low ($23.15) sets up a reversal opportunity.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: $27.96 (Weekly High), Support: $23.15 (Selling Climax Low), Last Close: $25.54

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Low volume test toward $23.15, or strong bullish follow-through above $27.96.
- **Invalidation:** Close below $23.15
---
### NICE (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Reaccumulation/Test in Area

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart shows a prior SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (Nov 2025) followed by a high volume/high CLV up move in Dec 2025 (attempt to absorb supply). The January 2026 monthly bar has tight spread and low CLV (0.13), indicating potential absorption after the bounce. The last weekly bar (01-19) is wide spread up bar closing high (CLV 0.54) on slightly below relative volume, confirming demand returning after the previous week's wide spread down bar (01-12) which saw high volume (potential shakeout/absorption). This suggests smart money is holding/absorbing supply near the 110 key level.

**Key Levels:** 109.30 (Weekly Low/Support), 118.37 (Recent High/Supply), 106.00 (Monthly Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Weekly close above 115.97 with confirming volume, targeting 118+
- **Invalidation:** Close below 108.00
---
### ONB (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result (ENR) Down

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but Monthly sequence is strong SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The last weekly bar (01-19) is a wide spread up bar on average volume, but the close is weak (CLV -0.298), failing to hold the highs (24.78). This signals Effort No Result, suggesting supply is absorbing the demand generated in the prior up move. Although the trend is bullish, this weekly action is concerning and warrants caution.

**Key Levels:** 24.78 (Recent Supply/High), 22.87 (Immediate Support), 23.75 (Previous High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Clear break above 24.78 with high volume, or a significant pullback to 23.00 with No Supply test.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 22.80
---
### OZK (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the recent weekly action is extremely weak. The last weekly bar (01-19) is a very wide spread down bar, closing near the low (CLV -0.91) on massive relative volume (2.37x average). This is a strong sign of Supply Dominance and Smart Money selling/shakeout. Given the prior bullish moves, this is either a major shakeout or the start of a deep correction. The weekly chart confirms SUPPLY_DOMINANCE.

**Key Levels:** 49.69 (Supply/Weekly High), 45.77 (Immediate Support/Weekly Low), 48.03 (Prior Support now Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Confirmation of weakness (e.g., break below 45.77 on follow-through volume) for short, or extreme No Demand below 45.00 for potential long reversal.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 48.50
---
### PGY (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS)
**VSA Status:** Secondary Test (ST) After Shakeout

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BEARISH, but the price experienced significant volatility. The prior weekly bar (01-12) was a massive shakeout (wide spread down, high volume, low CLV -0.93). The last weekly bar (01-19) is a wide spread up bar, closing mid-range (CLV 0.155) on average volume. This is likely a test following the shakeout. The monthly chart shows SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (Jan CLV -0.61). The rally failed to overcome the open of the shakeout bar (25.43), indicating persistent overhead supply.

**Key Levels:** 21.87 (Support from 01-12 low), 25.43 (Resistance/Shakeout Open), 20.62 (Low of recent action)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Clear bullish demand confirmation above 23.00, or confirmed rejection near 20.62 for a short entry.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 20.60
---
### PSN (NEUTRAL/BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result (ENR) Up

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BEARISH, and the Monthly sequence is confirmed SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (Dec 2025 drop). Price showed significant rally attempts in Jan 2026. However, the last weekly bar (01-19) is wide spread up, closing very low relative to the spread (CLV 0.023) on average volume. This is a classic Effort No Result up bar, suggesting heavy selling pressure absorbed the demand near 74.63. The rally is failing at the recent high.

**Key Levels:** 74.63 (Supply Zone/High), 70.74 (Immediate Support), 68.85 (Strong Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and hold below 70.74 targeting 68.85 and below.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 74.63
---
### PTGX (NEUTRAL/BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Test After Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BEARISH. The Monthly sequence signals a BUYING_CLIMAX watch. Price saw a sharp drop (01-05 week) after failing to exceed the recent 89-90 high. The subsequent week (01-12) was a down bar, and the last weekly bar (01-19) is an up bar, closing mid-range (CLV 0.147) on average volume. This looks like a weak secondary test of the recent demand failure. The lack of enthusiasm on the up move confirms that sellers are still in control, maintaining the bearish quarterly context.

**Key Levels:** 87.44 (Resistance/Supply), 79.87 (Immediate Support), 90.00 (Major Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 79.87 on confirming volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 87.50
---
### QQQI (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (BC) & Weak Secondary Test (ST)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BULLISH. Monthly context suggests a BUYING_CLIMAX watch, characterized by very high volume in January (2.19x RelVol). The last two weekly bars show massive volume (2.36x and 1.31x) with mediocre spreads and CLV. The 01-12 bar was high volume down (CLV -0.026). The 01-19 bar is a wide spread up bar, high close (CLV 0.73), but also on high volume. This volatility on extreme volume near highs (54.00) suggests significant churn and distribution near the peak. Requires confirmation of absorption or further selling.

**Key Levels:** 54.19 (Supply/Weekly High), 53.25 (Immediate Support), 52.78 (Strong Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 54.20 on volume for continuation, or breakdown below 53.25 for correction.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 52.75
---
### RARE (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS)
**VSA Status:** Demand Return (Attempt)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BEARISH, and the Monthly chart shows clear SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (Dec 2025 wide spread down on extreme volume). The last weekly bar (01-19) is a wide spread up bar, closing high (CLV 0.747) on high relative volume (1.47x). This strong up move suggests demand is attempting to reverse the trend from the 22.00 support area, which acted as a major reaction point after the Dec selling climax. However, this is still within the monthly distribution range, and needs follow-through to overcome supply.

**Key Levels:** 24.53 (Immediate Resistance), 22.00 (Strong Support/Reversal Point), 25.09 (Supply Zone)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Consolidation above 24.20 followed by a breakout, or a low volume test of 23.00.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 22.00
---
### RGTI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Secondary Test (ST) After Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BEARISH, and the Monthly chart confirms BUYING_CLIMAX (Jan 2026 wide spread, high volume). The last weekly bar (01-19) is a wide spread down bar, closing mid-range (CLV -0.49) on high volume (0.59x). This bar represents a secondary test following the peak volume of the climax. The price failed to sustain above 24.50, and the heavy volume on the down move confirms supply is still dominant, consistent with the long-term bearish trend.

**Key Levels:** 26.50 (Supply/Recent High), 22.41 (Immediate Support), 23.76 (Prior Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and hold below 23.45 on confirming volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 26.50
---
### RKT (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance/Shakeout Attempt

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the Monthly chart is on SUPPLY_DOMINANCE watch. Price showed a massive surge in the 01-05 week (Buying Climax), followed by a lower volume up-thrust/test week (01-12). The last weekly bar (01-19) is a wide spread down bar, closing mid-range (CLV -0.496) on high volume (0.77x). This looks like supply stepping in forcefully to shake out recent buyers, failing to hold the 22.00 support level. This is distribution near highs relative to the rally.

**Key Levels:** 24.36 (Buying Climax High), 20.53 (Immediate Support), 22.42 (Previous Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Confirmation of demand returning (No Supply test) near 20.50, or bearish follow-through below 20.50 for a correction.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 23.50
---
### SARO (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (BC)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BULLISH. The Weekly chart confirms a BUYING_CLIMAX in the last bar (01-19): wide spread up, closing mid-range (CLV 0.073) on extremely high relative volume (3.96x). This aggressive move into the supply zone near 34.50 with a weak close suggests massive distribution by smart money. The close failing to hold the high is critical evidence of supply absorption.

**Key Levels:** 34.48 (Climax High/Supply), 31.22 (Immediate Support), 32.97 (Weekly Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Confirmation of selling pressure (break below 31.22 on volume) for short, or low volume test near 32.00 for continuation attempt.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 34.50
---
### SYF (BULLISH Watch)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax (SC)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BEARISH. Weekly confirms STOPPING_VOLUME. The 01-12 week was a wide spread down bar, closing mid-range (CLV 0.52) on extreme volume (1.85x), acting as a potential Selling Climax. The subsequent bar (01-19) is a wide spread down bar, closing mid-low (CLV -0.40) on high volume (1.42x). While the close is lower, the price held significantly above the 01-12 low (74.95), suggesting follow-through supply was met by absorption. This looks like a successful attempt by Smart Money to wash out weak holders before accumulation.

**Key Levels:** 79.52 (Immediate Resistance), 74.95 (Selling Climax Low/Support), 81.84 (Previous High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Clear No Supply test near 76.00 or a break above 79.52.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 74.90
---
### TRU (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Secondary Test (ST) After Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BEARISH, but the Monthly chart confirms a strong STOPPING_VOLUME (Jan 2026 CLV -0.29). The 01-05 weekly bar was a strong reaction rally (high volume, high CLV 0.649) off the low. The last two weeks (01-12 and 01-19) show the market testing this demand. The last bar (01-19) is a wide spread down bar, closing mid-range (CLV -0.045) on high volume (0.66x). This means selling pressure was absorbed, preventing a collapse below 83.10. This is accumulation activity (Secondary Test), but lacks immediate confirmation for reversal.

**Key Levels:** 86.36 (Immediate Resistance), 81.71 (Accumulation Low/Support), 87.71 (Previous High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Low volume, tight spread close above 85.00, confirming demand is holding.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 81.70
---
### USIG (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS)
**VSA Status:** Weakness Confirmed (Supply Dominance)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the weekly chart flags SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. Despite the narrow trading range, the last two weeks saw high volume (2.36x and 1.11x). The 01-12 bar was high volume down (CLV -0.41). The 01-19 bar is a narrow spread up bar, closing high (CLV 0.94) on high volume. While the close is strong, the high volume in such a tight range near the highs (52.00) suggests persistent selling is meeting the demand. Smart money is distributing in this range, failing to achieve a clear mark-up. Lack of spread expansion on high volume is worrisome.

**Key Levels:** 52.12 (Supply/Weekly High), 51.65 (Immediate Support), 51.90 (Prior Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Decisive break above 52.12 on very high volume, or a breakdown below 51.65.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 51.60
---
### VONG (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Demand (ND) / Supply Confirmed

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BEARISH. The Monthly chart is on STOPPING_VOLUME watch, indicating internal weakness. The 01-12 week showed high volume (2.51x) with a down close, suggesting distribution/shakeout. The last weekly bar (01-19) is a wide spread up bar, closing high (CLV 0.70) but on average volume (1.34x). Crucially, the volume is significantly lower than the prior distribution week. This weak demand response (No Demand) following the high-volume down move suggests supply is waiting just above the current price. The bearish quarterly trend supports the idea that this up move is weak.

**Key Levels:** 120.94 (Immediate Resistance), 117.63 (Immediate Support), 123.18 (Prior High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Failure to exceed 120.94, followed by a close below 118.80.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 121.50
---
### WGMI (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (BC) Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BULLISH. Monthly sequence signals BUYING_CLIMAX watch. The 01-12 weekly bar was a wide spread up bar, closing high (CLV 0.805) on high volume (0.82x), confirming strong demand. The last weekly bar (01-19) is a wide spread up bar, closing mid-range (CLV 0.376) on high volume (1.02x). The failure to maintain the high close on high volume indicates supply stepping in strongly near 51.00 (Effort No Result Up). This is classic distribution activity after a strong run-up, warranting caution near the highs.

**Key Levels:** 51.78 (Climax High/Supply), 48.68 (Immediate Support), 45.11 (Strong Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Tight range consolidation (No Supply) above 49.00 for long, or break below 48.68 for correction.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 51.80
