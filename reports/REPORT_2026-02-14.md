- **Invalidation:** 326.40

### KKR (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Massive supply expansion on Feb 02 (RelVol 2.8) led to a breakdown. Feb 09 shows high volume continuing on the downside with a low CLV, indicating the markdown phase is active.

**Key Levels:** 97.37, 109.53

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** None - avoid
- **Invalidation:** 109.53
---
### KVYO (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Extreme volume (RelVol 2.8) on Feb 09 with a low CLV (-0.80) in a bearish quarterly context. This is aggressive institutional selling and a sign of further weakness.

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short on rallies to 20.00
- **Invalidation:** 22.09
---
### KYMR (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Feb 02 bar was strong, but Feb 09 shows volume remains average on a mid-range close while nearing historical climax levels on the monthly chart. Caution is warranted as demand may be exhausting.

**Key Levels:** 71.18, 86.18

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** High volume break of 86.20
- **Invalidation:** 76.51
---
### LSCC (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Upthrust

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Feb 09 bar features a very large spread and high volume (RelVol 2.01) but closed well off the highs (CLV 0.10). This indicates significant supply hidden within the rally, likely a bull trap.

**Key Levels:** 84.77, 108.08

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 97.00
- **Invalidation:** 108.08
---
### LTM (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Feb 09 saw massive volume expansion (RelVol 2.92) on a large down bar with a low CLV (-0.76). Supply has clearly entered the market and professionals are liquidating positions.

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short below 58.70
- **Invalidation:** 66.66
---
### MAT (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Panic selling volume on Feb 09 (RelVol 4.07). The huge spread down and extremely high volume indicate massive distribution and a breakdown of the previous support levels.

**Key Levels:** 14.75, 21.43

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** None - avoid
- **Invalidation:** 22.48
---
### MCO (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Feb 02 and Feb 09 showed heavy effort to fall with high volume. Despite the Stopping Volume algo detection, the lack of price recovery and continued downward pressure suggests supply remains in control.

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** None - Bearish Trend
- **Invalidation:** 452.04
---
### MNDY (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stock is in a free-fall with volume increasing on the downside (RelVol 4.59 on Feb 09). This is clear evidence of large-scale institutional selling; there is no demand visible.

**Key Levels:** 68.68, 92.73

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** None - avoid
- **Invalidation:** 80.90
---
### MSFU (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
High relative volume on the downside (Feb 09 RelVol 2.46) with a very low CLV. The stock is being heavily distributed and is consistently making new weekly lows.

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short below 27.10
- **Invalidation:** 30.79
---
### NFXL (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Stopping volume detected on the weekly but price continues to close near the low on high volume (CLV -0.68). Supply is not yet exhausted, and professionals are not yet aggressively supporting the price.

**Key Levels:** 19.30, 24.50

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for positive CLV on high volume
- **Invalidation:** 24.50
---
### NICE (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
High volume on Feb 09 (RelVol 1.66) resulted in a close on the dead low (CLV -0.92). This confirms monthly supply dominance and suggests significant further downside.

**Key Levels:** 103.10, 115.75

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short on rallies to 110.00
- **Invalidation:** 115.75
---
### OMF (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Strong volume on Feb 09 (RelVol 1.68) resulted in a large move down and a close near the low (CLV -0.82). This signals professional distribution and a continuation of the bearish quarterly context.

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short below 56.20
- **Invalidation:** 63.44
---
### ONB (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
Despite monthly supply dominance, the weekly chart shows price holding up. The Feb 09 bar is a moderate volume pullback, essentially testing the Jan 26 support. If volume remains low, an upward resolution is likely.

**Key Levels:** 23.37, 26.17

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 26.00
- **Invalidation:** 24.04
---
### OTIS (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result

**Smart Money Logic:**
High-volume churn on Jan 26, Feb 02, and Feb 09 (RelVol consistently > 1.6). Volume is very high but price is stuck in a range, suggesting a fierce battle between supply and demand with no clear winner yet.

**Key Levels:** 84.00, 93.58

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** High volume break of 93.60
- **Invalidation:** 85.28
---
### PAGP (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
Price is rising but the Weekly Relative Volume remains high (1.35x) while the spread is widening, which suggests professional selling into the strength. The algorithmic detection of Buying Climax combined with the extreme CLV (0.97) after a long trend indicates exhaustion.

**Key Levels:** 21.60, 20.70

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Failure to hold 21.00 on a low-volume test
- **Invalidation:** 21.75
---
### PGY (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stock is in a free fall with volume expanding on the down bars (RelVol 2.60). The very low CLV (-0.78) indicates no professional support is yet present to halt the decline.

**Key Levels:** 12.05, 15.51

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** None - Avoid catching a falling knife
- **Invalidation:** 16.00
---
### PHG (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result

**Smart Money Logic:**
A massive surge in volume (RelVol 2.81) resulted in a large spread but a close right in the middle (CLV -0.01). This indicates that as fast as Smart Money was buying, an equal or greater amount of supply was being dumped at the highs.

**Key Levels:** 33.43, 31.25, 29.13

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on break of 30.50
- **Invalidation:** 33.50
---
### PLTR (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Rejection at 42.00
- **Invalidation:** 47.00
---
### PRU (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Massive supply entered on the Feb 02 bar (RelVol 2.41). The subsequent week's bounce on 1.34 RelVol failed to close higher than the previous mid-point, indicating a lack of demand.

**Key Levels:** 98.80, 104.61

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short on break of 102.00
- **Invalidation:** 107.00
---

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Sell rallies toward 67.00
- **Invalidation:** 70.00
---
### PTC (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
High volume on Feb 02 and Feb 09 shows that buyers are entering. However, the quarterly context is bearish and the price hasn't cleared supply at 160.00.

**Key Levels:** 146.72, 162.92

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Successful test of 150.00 on low volume
- **Invalidation:** 146.00
---
### PTGX (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
Extremely low relative volume (0.38) on the most recent week suggests Smart Money has withdrawn interest. Price is drifting without conviction.

**Key Levels:** 80.20, 84.48

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for high volume effort bar
- **Invalidation:** 79.00
---
### QQQI (NEUTRAL)

Volume is consistent with the sideways/choppy SPY trend. No clear evidence of Smart Money accumulation or distribution.

**Key Levels:** 51.83, 54.67

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** None
- **Invalidation:** 51.50
---
### QTWO (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Volume doubled (RelVol 2.03) as price broke down. Low CLV (-0.50) confirms that the path of least resistance is currently down.

**Key Levels:** 51.34, 58.93

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short on rally to 55.00
- **Invalidation:** 60.00
---
### RARE (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Price broke the support of the previous four weeks on high volume (RelVol 1.28). This signifies a failure of demand.

**Key Levels:** 19.61, 24.67

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short below 20.00
- **Invalidation:** 23.50
---
### RF (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Upthrust / Supply Entry

**Smart Money Logic:**
After a high-volume push to 31.53, the Feb 09 week saw a reversal on high volume with a low CLV (-0.60). This is a classic 'hidden' upthrust indicating distribution at the highs.

**Key Levels:** 29.29, 31.53

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short below 29.50
- **Invalidation:** 31.60
---
### RGTI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
Price continues to drift lower on very low relative volume (0.52). There is a complete lack of professional buying interest.

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** None
- **Invalidation:** 18.50
---
### RKT (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Lateral Absorption

**Smart Money Logic:**
Volume is drying up near the lows of the range. No significant VSA signals to suggest an imminent breakout or breakdown.

**Key Levels:** 17.04, 21.19

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for RelVol > 1.5
- **Invalidation:** 17.00
---
### RTO (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
High RelVol (2.86) on the Feb 02 up-move resulted in an immediate reversal on high volume (1.51 RelVol) the following week with a low close. This is clear distribution.

**Key Levels:** 30.04, 32.77

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short below 30.40
- **Invalidation:** 32.80
---
### RVMD (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Overcoming Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
The massive gap down on Jan 26 on high volume shifted the trend. Subsequent volume has been low, indicating no 'V-shape' recovery interest from professionals.

**Key Levels:** 92.50, 99.58

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short below 93.00
- **Invalidation:** 100.00
---
### RYAAY (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

- **Invalidation:** 68.60
---
### SARO (BEARISH)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short below 29.50
- **Invalidation:** 31.20
---
### SATS (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Large spreads and high volume on down moves (RelVol 1.78) show that professionals are exiting. Narrower spread on Feb 09 with mid-close suggests a pause, but not a reversal.

**Key Levels:** 106.59, 117.86

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short on break of 111.00
- **Invalidation:** 118.00
---
### SPOT (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
Enormous spread and volume (RelVol 2.80) on the most recent week. While there is some buying (mid-close), the momentum of supply is too great to consider a long entry yet.

**Key Levels:** 405.00, 504.82

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for secondary test of 410.00
- **Invalidation:** 510.00
---

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** None
- **Invalidation:** 80.00
---
### SYF (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
High volume selling (RelVol 2.13) on Jan 26 was followed by a weak low-volume bounce and then another high volume drop on Feb 09.

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short below 71.00
- **Invalidation:** 76.00
---
### TROW (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

- **Entry Trigger:** Short below 38.00
- **Invalidation:** 41.00
---
### UNH (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Extreme distribution. RelVol of 2.97 on Jan 26 was a major liquidation event. Feb 09 saw a bounce on volume, but it remains within the context of massive supply overhead.

**Key Levels:** 266.29, 293.45

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** None
- **Invalidation:** 300.00
---
### USIG (NEUTRAL)

---
### VLTO (BEARISH)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short below 29.50
- **Invalidation:** 33.00
---
### VNT (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result

**Smart Money Logic:**
Massive volume (RelVol 1.92) on an up-attempt that failed to hold the highs (CLV -0.36). This shows significant supply overhead or professional selling into the move.

**Key Levels:** 38.79, 48.20

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on break of 41.00
- **Invalidation:** 48.50
---

**Key Levels:** 114.79, 119.33

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** None
- **Invalidation:** 119.00
---
### WGMI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Large volume effort resulted in a breakdown through the 44.00 support. The latest week shows very low volume, indicating a lack of buyers on the dip.

**Key Levels:** 34.99, 44.50

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short on minor rally
- **Invalidation:** 45.00
---
### WMG (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
The volume spike on Feb 02 (RelVol 2.34) with an off-low close suggests professional support. Feb 09 saw higher volume but a tighter spread, confirming absorption.

**Key Levels:** 26.42, 31.19

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Reclaim 30.00
- **Invalidation:** 28.00
---
### WRB (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** No Interest

**Smart Money Logic:**
Volume and spread are contracting. Smart Money is not active in this ticker currently. No trade setup.

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for RelVol > 1.2
- **Invalidation:** 67.00
---
### XYL (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short rallies to 132.00
- **Invalidation:** 138.00
---
### Z (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax / Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The ticker shows a massive surge in volume (RelVol 2.94) on a wide-spreading down bar. The very low Close-Locational Value (CLV -0.86) indicates the market closed near the bottom of its range, confirming that professional supply is currently overwhelming demand. While the high volume suggests a climax is occurring, the lack of a 'Stopping Volume' tail suggests the floor has not yet been established.

**Key Levels:** 42.50, 54.63, 63.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a 'Test' on low volume or a 'Spring' reversal to confirm supply exhaustion.
- **Invalidation:** 42.00
---
### ZM (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Effort No Result

**Smart Money Logic:**
ZM experienced a high-volume surge into the 92-97 range, but the price has struggled to close near its highs (CLV near 0 for multiple weeks). This 'Effort No Result' behavior suggests smart money is distributing into the retail demand. While the quarterly trend remains bullish, the weekly volume profile indicates a period of absorption or correction is required before further upside.

**Key Levels:** 97.58, 91.50, 86.40

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A high-volume breakout above 97.60 or a successful 'No Supply' test at 86.40 support.
- **Invalidation:** 86.00
