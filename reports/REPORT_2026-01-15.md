### MSTR (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Spring / Shakeout followed by Absorption and Effort to Rise

**Smart Money Logic:**
Smart money likely initiated aggressive selling/distribution during the Nov/Dec 2025 monthly downtrend, flushing out weak hands and creating a selling climax. Once the price reached a capitulation point (around 150), they stepped in to absorb the remaining supply, evidenced by the high volume during the 'Spring' and subsequent 'Tests' where prices held firm. The strong up bars on increasing volume across weekly and daily charts, particularly the latest daily bar with high volume closing near the high, indicate smart money is now actively marking up the price, confirming their accumulation phase and readiness to drive the price higher from the re-accumulated lows.

**Correlation:**
The monthly timeframe established a strong downtrend culminating in a potential selling climax in Nov/Dec 2025. The current monthly bar, with a low 'springing' below previous lows (149.75 vs 151.41) and a strong close in the upper half on below-average volume, signals absorption of supply at a macro level. The weekly chart confirms this with stopping volume preceding a clear 'Spring' bar (2026-01-05, low of 154 below prior week's open, closing flat on high volume) and a subsequent 'Effort to Rise' (current weekly bar, 2026-01-12) on very high volume, confirming strong demand. The daily timeframe provides granular confirmation, showing a precise 'Spring' on 2026-01-02 (low 149.75 under Dec's low 151.41), followed by successful 'Tests for Supply' on lower volume (2026-01-06, 2026-01-09), and a powerful 'Effort to Rise' on increasing volume in the last two bars (2026-01-13, 2026-01-14). This multi-timeframe alignment of a spring/shakeout, absorption, and demand coming in suggests a strong bullish reversal is underway.

**Key Levels:** Support at 149.75 (Monthly/Daily Spring Low), Immediate Resistance at 190-198 (Previous Weekly/Monthly Highs), Secondary Resistance at 250-260 (Oct/Nov 2025 consolidation area)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Look for a slight pullback to the 170-175 range on decreasing volume ('No Supply Test') as an optimal entry point, anticipating a retest and breakout of the 190-198 resistance. Alternatively, a decisive break and close above 198 on very high volume could confirm further upside momentum.
- **Volume Req:** For continued upward movement, demand should remain dominant. Look for high to very high volume on up bars and significantly decreasing volume on any pullbacks ('No Supply Tests'). A breakout above 198 would require exceptional volume to confirm conviction.
- **Invalidation:** A daily close below the multi-timeframe spring low of 149.75 would invalidate the bullish setup, suggesting the selling pressure is not yet exhausted and further downside is probable.
- **Exit Trigger:** Target the 198-200 level for initial profit-taking. Subsequent targets include 250 and 320. A significant wide spread down bar on very high volume (indicating supply re-emerging) or failure to sustain momentum above key resistance levels would warrant an exit.

## 👀 Watch/Monitoring
### MSFT (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Continuing Down-Thrust / Weakness (Monthly & Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Smart Money initiated significant distribution from the 550+ highs in mid-2025. Recently, they are actively pushing the price lower, absorbing any attempts by weaker hands to buy on dips (evident in the failed weekly/daily rallies with high volume but poor closes, such as the weekly bar ending 2026-01-05). The current wide-spread down moves on increasing or above-average volume, particularly on the weekly and daily, suggest continued distribution and a clear intent to drive prices further down. The lower-than-average monthly volume on the latest down bar indicates a lack of urgent selling climax but a persistent absence of demand, allowing Smart Money to continue their operations without significant resistance. The breakdown of significant support levels confirms their control and the ongoing downtrend.

**Correlation:**
The Monthly chart shows a significant downtrend developing from mid-2025 highs (553.5), breaking prior support levels. The latest monthly bar (2026-01-01) is a wide-spread down, closing near its low (459.38) on significantly below-average volume (244M vs 436M SMA), indicating weakness and a lack of underlying demand, but not yet a selling climax. The Weekly chart reinforces this bearish sentiment with successive wide-spread down bars, notably the current week (2026-01-12) closing at its low (459.38) on slightly above-average volume (108M vs 105M SMA), confirming strong selling pressure. Previous weekly rallies (like the one ending 2026-01-05) failed to close strong despite high volume, demonstrating significant supply absorption. The Daily chart mirrors this weakness, with the last two bars (2026-01-13 & 2026-01-14) being wide-spread down on above-average volume, closing at new lows (459.38). Rallies on the daily (e.g., 2026-01-07, high 489.70) were met with heavy supply at resistance, leading to reversals. This multi-timeframe alignment confirms a dominant bearish trend with persistent selling pressure.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Support at 457.17 (current low), Minor Resistance at 470.00 (previous daily swing low, now broken), Resistance at 475.00 (where daily rallies were rejected), Strong Resistance at 483.00-490.00 (area where daily/weekly rallies failed on supply), Major Resistance at 505.00-510.00 (previous weekly congestion before the sharp fall), Next major support below 457.17 around 390.00-400.00 (monthly lows from early 2025)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A break and close below the current low of 457.17 on strong volume (confirming continuation of down-thrust) OR a weak rally (narrow spread up bar on low volume - 'No Demand') into the 465-470 resistance zone, followed by a wide spread down bar on high volume.
- **Volume Req:** For a downside continuation, sustained high or increased volume on down moves and low or diminishing volume on rallies. For a potential reversal, very high volume on a down move with a relatively small spread and a close away from the low ('Selling Climax') or a wide spread up bar on very high volume ('Effort to Rise').
- **Invalidation:** A daily close above 475.00 would invalidate the immediate bearish pressure and indicate a potential short-term reversal. A stronger invalidation would be a daily close above 490.00.
- **Exit Trigger:** A wide spread up bar closing near its high on very high volume after a significant move down (Sign of 'Stopping Volume' or 'Selling Climax') OR a clear rejection of lower prices (e.g., a 'Shakeout' bar with high volume but strong close off the lows) OR confirmation of a failed down-thrust by price closing above a resistance level (e.g., 475) on strong volume. For a short position, exit if the invalidation level is breached.
