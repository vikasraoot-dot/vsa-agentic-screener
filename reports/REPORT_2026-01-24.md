## 🚀 Ready for Entry
### AEO (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort Down with Result (Bearish Continuation)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar (W5) printed a wide spread and closed at the extreme low, showing clear dominance of supply, despite not having ultra-high volume. This action confirms the weakness suggested by the monthly Buying Climax warning.

**Key Levels:** 24.08 (W5 Low Support), 25.44 (W4 Close/Support), 26.70 (W5 High/Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and sustained trade below 24.08 (W5 Low).
- **Invalidation:** Close above 26.69 (W5 High)
---
### AEVA (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Distribution Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The aggressive rally in W3 (high volume) was met by immediate supply in W4 (Effort No Result). W5 confirms supply dominance with a wide spread and extreme low close on high volume, signaling institutional sellers are actively dumping inventory near the 22.62 highs.

**Key Levels:** 22.62 (Supply High), 17.45 (W4 Low/Support), 15.76 (W5 Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 15.76 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 20.60 (W5 High)
---
### AGIO (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply/Demand Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
Following a confirmed monthly Stopping Volume phase, the weekly charts show strong demand (W5 closed high) after a low volume shakeout (W4). The pullback resistance was met with low volume selling, suggesting supply exhaustion in the 26.25 area. Ready for markup.

**Key Levels:** 26.25 (Confirmed Support/Shakeout Low), 29.10 (Immediate Resistance), 30.04 (W1 High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 29.10 with increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 26.25
---
### AMBA (BULLISH (Counter-trend setup))
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (W4) followed by No Supply (W5)

**Smart Money Logic:**
W4 showed significant institutional buying (Stopping Volume) at the lows (64.00) on ultra-high volume. W5, the next bar, is a low volume test back toward that level, confirming the lack of aggressive follow-through selling (No Supply). This sets up a potential counter-trend rally.

**Key Levels:** 64.00 (Stopping Volume Low/Support), 70.77 (Immediate Resistance), 66.75 (W5 Open)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close above 68.73 (W4 close) on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 64.00
---
### AMZU (BULLISH (Counter-trend setup))
**VSA Status:** Successful Test/No Supply (Demand Reassertion)

**Smart Money Logic:**
W3 showed major demand absorption, and W5 confirmed the successful test of this demand zone (36.35 low), closing strongly near the high (37.05). Low volume on the pullback (W4/W5 open) suggests supply exhaustion. Ready for markup against the quarterly trend.

**Key Levels:** 36.35 (Demand Support), 40.40 (Recent High/Supply Resistance), 37.45 (W5 High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 37.45 (W5 High) on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 36.34 (W4 Low)
---
### ARE (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Persistent Demand/Markup Continuation

**Smart Money Logic:**
Strong bullish momentum confirmed across the last three weeks (W3-W5), with consistent high closes indicating relentless institutional demand driving the price upward. This confirms the success of the accumulation phase suggested by the monthly SV warning.

**Key Levels:** 56.00 (Immediate Support), 59.76 (Recent High/Target), 60.00 (Psychological Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 59.76 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 57.88 (W4 Close)
---
### ARES (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Aggressive Supply / Markdown Initiation

**Smart Money Logic:**
W5 shows extreme supply dominance (CLV -0.97) and a wide spread, signaling aggressive distribution following the hesitation in W4. This is a clear markdown phase initiation, confirming the monthly Buying Climax warning.

**Key Levels:** 155.74 (W5 Low), 166.43 (W4 Low Support), 177.72 (Distribution High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below 155.74 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 170.22 (W5 High)
---
### AS (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Sign of Strength / Successful Test of Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
W5 produced a strong Sign of Strength, closing at the high on good volume, immediately following a low-volume pullback (W4). This signifies demand reassertion and clearance of recent supply. Expect continuation toward previous highs (40.00).

**Key Levels:** 37.74 (W5 High/Target), 36.45 (W4 Low Support), 35.54 (W5 Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry on continuation above 37.74.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 36.45
---
### AVAV (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax Confirmation / Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The rally peaked in W4 following a massive Buying Climax (W3). W5 delivered extreme weakness, printing a massive spread and closing near the low on high volume, signifying powerful institutional distribution and immediate markdown initiation.

**Key Levels:** 408.25 (Climax High), 300.00 (W5 Low Support), 346.47 (W4 Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below 300.00 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 390.04 (W5 High)
---
### AXTI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Markdown Initiation

**Smart Money Logic:**
After a massive Buying Climax in W2/W3, institutional distribution was confirmed in W4. W5 is a strong bearish continuation bar, closing at the absolute low on high volume, signaling active markdown. The market is now vulnerable to significant downside.

**Key Levels:** 26.66 (Distribution High), 17.01 (W5 Low Support), 20.81 (W5 Open)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and sustained trade below 17.01.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 22.69 (W5 High)
---
### AZN (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Successful Test / Demand Reassertion

**Smart Money Logic:**
W4 saw massive institutional volume suggesting either distribution or absorption. W5, printing high volume and closing at the absolute high, confirms that the supply was absorbed (successful shakeout/test of demand). This re-establishes the bullish momentum toward 96+.

**Key Levels:** 92.78 (W4 Low Support), 96.51 (Recent High/Supply Target)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry on volume confirmation above 94.38 (W4 close).
- **Invalidation:** Close below 92.77 (W4 Low)
---
### BAH (BEARISH (Short-term reversal likely))
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result Up / Buying Climax Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
W5 showed high volume and a massive spread but failed to close strongly, indicating strong supply absorbed the buying effort near 109. This confirms the distribution phase signaled by the monthly Buying Climax. Expect a markdown phase.

**Key Levels:** 109.10 (Supply High), 96.73 (W5 Open/Support), 94.73 (W4 Low Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below 97.40 (W4 close) on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 109.10
---
### BANC (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Markdown Initiation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The strong confirmation of the monthly Buying Climax by W5 is evident: wide spread, high volume, and an extremely poor close (CLV -0.95). This confirms institutional distribution and the likely start of a significant markdown phase.

**Key Levels:** 19.88 (W5 Low Support), 21.61 (Recent High/Supply)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below 19.88 on high volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 21.09 (W4 High)
---
### BFH (BEARISH (Short-term reversal))
**VSA Status:** Aggressive Supply / Failed Stopping Volume Follow-through

**Smart Money Logic:**
Despite W4 showing massive buying volume (Stopping Volume), W5 delivered overwhelming supply, closing near the absolute low on good volume. This abrupt reversal suggests the high volume was absorbed by professional selling, initiating a markdown phase.

**Key Levels:** 68.57 (W5 Low Support), 74.17 (W4 High Resistance), 67.78 (W4 Shakeout Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below 68.57 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 73.76 (W5 High)
---
### BKKT (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Markdown Initiation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The strong momentum in W3/W4 was violently reversed in W5. The wide spread and near-low close on strong volume indicate significant institutional selling, confirming supply dominance. This negates the recent bullish phase.

**Key Levels:** 14.50 (W5 Low Support), 19.78 (W5 High/Resistance), 15.22 (W5 Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and sustained trade below 14.50.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 19.78
---
### BNS (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Demand Reassertion / Sign of Strength

**Smart Money Logic:**
The aggressive supply from W3 was quickly absorbed and negated by demand in W4 and W5. W5 closed strongly near the high on lower volume, confirming low resistance (No Supply) and sustained bullish intent, despite the SUPPLY_DOMINANCE flag.

**Key Levels:** 74.97 (Recent High/Target), 72.93 (W5 Low Support), 71.63 (W3 Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry on volume continuation above 74.97.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 73.47 (W4 close)
---
### BP (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Successful No Supply Test / Demand Reassertion

**Smart Money Logic:**
W3 showed institutional supply, but subsequent demand (W4) and the low volume rally (W5, closing high) indicate that the supply has been absorbed and resistance is minimal (No Supply). Setup for markup continuation.

**Key Levels:** 36.70 (W5 High/Resistance), 35.03 (Immediate Support), 34.06 (W4 Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close above 36.70 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 35.03
---
### BRBR (BULLISH (Counter-trend reversal))
**VSA Status:** Demand Reassertion / Accumulation Confirmed

This is a strong sign of demand entering the market, effectively reversing the preceding wide spread down bar ('2026-01-12') which had ultra-high selling pressure (CLV -0.92). The price action suggests Smart Money aggressively absorbed supply near the 63.44 low, indicating a potential reversal in the short term, especially following the Quarterly BEARISH_TREND and Monthly SUPPLY_DOMINANCE context.

### RGTI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result Down / Monthly Buying Climax Confirmed

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly context confirmed a BUYING_CLIMAX in January, evidenced by the large spread on high volume closing near the low (CLV -0.27) following previous distribution activity. The last weekly bar ('2026-01-19') is a wide spread down on elevated volume (RelVol 0.49), closing poorly (CLV -0.49). This wide down movement from the high of the week ($26.50) signals strong supply overcoming the bulls, aligning with the confirmed monthly reversal signal.

**Key Levels:** 22.41 (Immediate Support), 24.50 (Recent Consolidation Midpoint), 26.70 (Supply/Climax High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below 22.40 on confirming volume.

---
### RLI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Reverse Thrust Down (RTD) / Confirmed Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
RLI is in a Quarterly BEARISH_TREND, and the monthly context is WATCH_FOR_TEST following a potential Buying Climax. The last two weeks confirm supply dominance. The bar of '2026-01-19' is a wide spread down on high volume (RelVol 1.44), closing near the low (CLV -0.48), confirming weakness. This Reverse Thrust Down significantly breaks previous support levels ($60.00, $62.00) and confirms that the brief demand efforts in early January have failed.

**Key Levels:** 55.80 (Immediate Support), 60.00 (New Resistance), 63.74 (Supply Line)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on any low volume rally (No Demand) towards $58.00, or break below $55.80.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 60.00
---
### RTO (BULLISH (Caution))
**VSA Status:** High Volume Up Bar (Buying Climax or Thrust)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence shows a STOPPING_VOLUME signal, which suggests accumulation/reversal is in play, aligning with the Quarterly BULLISH_TREND. The most recent bar ('2026-01-19') is a wide spread UP bar on Ultra High Volume (RelVol 2.50), closing near the high (CLV 0.83). This is a strong thrust indicating professional demand entering, driving the price through resistance. While highly bullish, the volume spikes suggest climaxing activity, meaning a Test or a minor Shakeout is likely soon.

**Key Levels:** 31.54 (Immediate Support), 33.13 (Recent High), 30.76 (Last Major Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry on a successful low volume Test/pullback to $31.50-$32.00, or break above $33.15.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 30.76
---
### SA (BULLISH (Short-term extended))
**VSA Status:** Climactic Thrust Up

**Smart Money Logic:**
SA is in a Quarterly BULLISH_TREND. The most recent weekly bar ('2026-01-19') is an extremely wide spread UP bar on high volume (RelVol 1.006), closing mid-high (CLV 0.48). This aggressive move breaks clear of the recent consolidation range (30-32). The high volume confirms demand entry and breakout strength. The monthly context is WATCH_FOR_TEST, and this thrust may be the reaction to that test, signaling continuation.

**Key Levels:** 31.75 (Immediate Support/Breakout Zone), 37.99 (Recent High), 30.86 (Prior Close/Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry on a Test of the $32.00 zone on low volume, or a definitive move above $38.00.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 31.75

### SARO (NEUTRAL/BEARISH (Reversal Imminent))
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

The weekly sequence detected a BUYING_CLIMAX. The last weekly bar ('2026-01-19') is marked by Ultra High Volume (RelVol 3.69!) on a wide spread, but the CLV is very low (0.07). This indicates massive selling occurred near the high ($34.47) as Smart Money distributed heavily into the retail buying frenzy. This is a clear supply warning, despite the bullish quarterly context.

**Key Levels:** 31.22 (Immediate Support), 34.48 (Climax High/Supply), 30.77 (Key Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on break below 31.22 (low of the climax bar) on confirming volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 34.48
---
### STAA (BEARISH (Weakness Continuation))
**VSA Status:** Confirmed Selling Climax (SC) followed by Supply Continuation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence signaled STOPPING_VOLUME two weeks ago, but the follow-through was poor. The last bar ('2026-01-19') is a wide spread down on high volume (RelVol 0.96) closing on the low (CLV -0.92). This indicates supply is still dominating, pushing the price lower, negating the prior stopping volume signal and confirming continuation of the BEARISH_TREND. The recent monthly bar also closed extremely weak (CLV -0.96).

**Key Levels:** 19.06 (Immediate Low), 20.97 (Failed Support), 22.12 (Supply Zone)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on break and close below 19.05.

The market showed a wide spread down bar two weeks ago on ultra-high volume (RelVol 1.85, CLV 0.52), signaling potential stopping volume or a shakeout. However, the subsequent bar ('2026-01-19') is a wide spread down on elevated volume (RelVol 1.07), closing poorly (CLV -0.40). This RTD from the previous high confirms supply is dominant, pushing the price lower, breaking below the immediate support. The monthly bar also closed extremely weak (CLV -0.75).

**Key Levels:** 75.37 (Immediate Support), 80.19 (Failed Support/Resistance), 81.84 (Supply Zone)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on breakdown below 75.37, or on a low volume rally towards $78.00.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 80.19
---
### TFX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Confirmed Supply Continuation

**Smart Money Logic:**
TFX is in a Quarterly BEARISH_TREND and Weekly SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The last two weekly bars are characterized by wide spreads down on high volume (RelVol 1.61, 1.06), demonstrating strong selling pressure. The most recent bar ('2026-01-19') is a mid-spread bar closing near the low (CLV -0.06), slightly recovering but the overall price action indicates heavy supply presence, confirmed by the extremely weak monthly close (CLV -0.76). The high volume indicates Smart Money selling into previous demand zones.

**Key Levels:** 100.18 (Immediate Support), 107.06 (Resistance/Supply Line), 112.90 (Key Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on break below 100.18 on confirming volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 107.06
---
### USIG (NEUTRAL/BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply Detected (Tight Range)

**Smart Money Logic:**
USIG is consolidating in a very tight, slightly upward trending channel within a BULLISH_TREND quarterly context. The last bar ('2026-01-19') shows a tight spread on slightly below average volume (RelVol 0.94), closing strongly (CLV 0.94). This indicates successful demand entry and price controlled near the high. The lower volume confirms that supply is absent or being successfully absorbed/tested. Given the tight range, a breakout is likely imminent.

**Key Levels:** 51.65 (Consolidation Low), 52.12 (Consolidation High), 51.90 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close above 52.12.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 51.60
---
### VONG (BULLISH (Short-term))
**VSA Status:** Absorption/Test after Supply (Volume Contraction)

**Smart Money Logic:**
VONG is in a BEARISH_TREND but the monthly context is WATCH_FOR_TEST, suggesting accumulation might be occurring. The last weekly bar ('2026-01-19') is a narrow spread UP bar on high volume (RelVol 1.18), closing near the high (CLV 0.70). This suggests demand is absorbing recent supply (two weeks ago had high volume down). Importantly, volume dropped from the previous week's ultra-high selling volume, indicating supply exhaustion and successful professional intervention near the $117.63 lows.

**Key Levels:** 117.63 (Major Demand Zone), 120.94 (Immediate Resistance), 123.59 (Supply Zone)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 120.94, confirming demand strength.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 117.60
---
## 👀 Watch/Monitoring
### ABT (BEARISH (Short-term exhaustion likely))
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax/Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Extreme ultra-high volume and wide spread (W5) closing near the low signifies panic selling and major supply dumping. This is the culmination of the recent bearish move. Smart money will observe the reaction to this level. Given the magnitude, a reaction (bounce or test) is imminent.

**Key Levels:** 105.78 (Recent Low), 110.00 (Psychological), 121.00 (Previous Support/Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a successful Test of Supply (low volume bounce/consolidation near 106)
- **Invalidation:** N/A (Too volatile currently, wait for consolidation base formation)
---
### ABVX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Demand/Weak Reaction Rally

**Smart Money Logic:**
Following aggressive supply (W3, W4 on high volume), W5 shows a weak rally attempt (narrower spread, low volume, RelVol 0.66). This low volume reaction indicates a lack of follow-through demand, confirming the dominance of supply established earlier in January.

**Key Levels:** 113.64 (Recent Low Support), 125.86 (Immediate Resistance), 130.00 (Key Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Failure to hold 120 (mid-point of W5 spread) followed by renewed high volume selling.
- **Invalidation:** Break above 130.13 (W4 high) on high effort
---
### ACLX (BEARISH (Intermediate weakness))
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result Up / Major Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
An ultra-wide spread (W5) on high volume failed to maintain gains, closing near the low (67.7). This is a strong indication of institutional selling (distribution) absorbing demand near the 76.5 highs, contradicting the bullish quarterly trend.

**Key Levels:** 76.50 (Supply High), 66.00 (Previous Support/Resistance), 63.33 (W4 Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 66.00 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** A strong rally and hold above 70.00
---
### ACN (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Continuation / Potential No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
Strong bullish effort confirmed in W3 and W4 (high volume, high close). W5 shows decreasing relative volume during consolidation/slight pull-back, indicating Smart Money is not aggressively selling yet. Waiting for a low volume test of demand below 280.

**Key Levels:** 279.50 (Recent Demand Zone), 291.08 (Recent High), 258.00 (Major Support/W2 Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Low volume reaction back towards 279-280, followed by a Sign of Strength.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 273.00 (W4 Low)
---
### AIG (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Consolidation after Supply Dominance / Potential No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
W3 and W4 showed extreme selling climax/supply action on ultra-high volume, dropping price significantly (from 86 to 72). W5's low volume consolidation suggests a temporary pause, not strong buying. Expect selling to resume or a failed test of resistance.

**Key Levels:** 71.25 (Recent Low Support), 73.70 (Immediate Resistance), 76.00 (Test Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below 71.25 on high volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 76.04 (W4 High)
---
### AIQ (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Sign of Strength / Demand Reassertion

**Smart Money Logic:**
W5 showed a strong recovery, closing near the high, successfully overcoming the supply that appeared in W3/W4. This is a potential absorption and markup continuation, aligning with the bullish quarterly context.

**Key Levels:** 50.87 (W5 Low/Demand Test), 53.25 (Recent High/Supply Zone), 52.50 (W5 Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 53.25 on above-average volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 51.83 (W4 Low)
---
### AL (NEUTRAL (Bias Bullish))
**VSA Status:** Ultra-Low Volatility Consolidation / No Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
The price has been held in an extremely tight range (64.07-64.47) over five weeks on significantly reduced volume. This suggests professional accumulation or quiet holding pattern. The low volume indicates no aggressive supply in this range.

**Key Levels:** 64.07 (Consolidation Support), 64.47 (Consolidation Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 64.47 on high volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 64.00
---
### ALC (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Backing Up Action / Test of Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
Following the confirmed Stopping Volume signal (Monthly), the weekly action shows minor reactions (W2-W4) but no aggressive follow-through selling. W5 stabilized the price, suggesting the recent pullback is a successful test of demand. Demand is holding the 78-79 zone.

**Key Levels:** 77.88 (W4 Low Support), 82.50 (Recent High Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 81.65 (W4 high) on volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 77.00
---
### ALL (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax followed by Consolidation

**Smart Money Logic:**
Extreme supply pressure in W4 drove prices sharply lower (191-210 range, closed at 192). This climax aligns with the long-term bearish context. W5 shows high volume selling contained in a narrow range near the lows (191-196), indicating potential absorption, but the primary trend is still down.

**Key Levels:** 191.13 (Selling Climax Low Support), 196.09 (Immediate Resistance), 200.00 (Psychological Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below 191.13 on high volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 196.09
---
### AMH (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Consolidation/Test after Shakeout

**Smart Money Logic:**
The aggressive shakeout in W3 (high volume low) was followed by a Sign of Strength in W4. W5 consolidated these gains on average volume, indicating that supply is not aggressively stepping in to reverse the trend. The consolidation is likely preparatory for a markup continuation.

**Key Levels:** 32.65 (Recent High/Resistance), 31.50 (Immediate Support), 30.51 (W4 Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close above 32.45 (W4 high) on volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 31.50
---
### ARWR (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Demand / Reaction Rally after Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
W3 and W4 confirmed strong institutional supply. W5 is a wide spread recovery on reduced volume (RelVol 0.63). This low volume reaction indicates insufficient demand to overcome the recent distribution (No Demand), suggesting weakness will likely continue.

**Key Levels:** 61.65 (W5 Low Support), 68.44 (W4 High Resistance), 71.16 (W5 High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Failure to hold 67.00, followed by a close below 63.33 (W4 low).
- **Invalidation:** Close above 71.16
---
### AXTA (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** No Demand/Continuation Pause

**Smart Money Logic:**
W4 saw intense volume near the highs, suggesting potential breakout preparation. W5 shows a sharp reduction in volume (RelVol 0.61) while maintaining the price near the recent highs, confirming a lack of aggressive selling (No Demand). Ready for markup continuation.

**Key Levels:** 32.76 (Immediate Support), 34.20 (W5 High/Resistance), 33.61 (W5 Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 34.20 on renewed high volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 32.80 (W4 Low)
---
### BABX (NEUTRAL (Bias Bearish))
**VSA Status:** Volatile Consolidation / Effort No Result (W4)

**Smart Money Logic:**
W4 showed aggressive selling absorbing the rally near 49.31, confirmed by high volume and a poor close (Effort No Result). W5 is volatile but lacks the extreme volume seen in the supply phase, suggesting a standoff. The recent distribution limits immediate upside potential.

**Key Levels:** 49.31 (Distribution High), 42.82 (W5 Low Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 49.31 on high volume (bullish) OR break below 42.82 (bearish).
- **Invalidation:** N/A (Too wide range currently)
---
### BBIO (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Consolidation after Absorption/Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
W4's extreme volume and wide range (Stopping Volume alert) suggest institutional activity, likely absorption of supply. W5 is a low volume consolidation, acting as a successful test of demand and clearance of recent supply. Markup continuation is likely.

**Key Levels:** 79.88 (Supply Resistance), 73.77 (W5 Low Support), 70.95 (W4 Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 79.88 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 73.77
---
### BBT (NEUTRAL (Potential Pullback))
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result Up / Supply Presence

**Smart Money Logic:**
W5 showed strong effort (wide spread) but failed to maintain the high, closing near the middle. This Effort No Result indicates institutional selling/supply is active near the 29.62 high, suggesting the rally is exhausted and a pullback or reversal is likely.

**Key Levels:** 27.00 (W5 Low Support), 29.63 (Supply High), 27.48 (W4 Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Test of 27.00 with low volume and subsequent bounce (Test of Demand).
- **Invalidation:** Break and hold above 29.63
---
### BBWI (NEUTRAL (Bias Bearish))
**VSA Status:** No Demand / Failed Markup Continuation

**Smart Money Logic:**
Following strong markup bars (W3/W4), W5 is a wide-spread reaction down on significantly reduced volume (RelVol 0.44), closing poorly. This suggests a strong lack of interest (No Demand) following the highs, indicating a likely pullback or reversal, aligning with the Monthly Supply Dominance.

**Key Levels:** 21.58 (W5 Low Support), 23.73 (Recent High/Supply), 22.38 (W4 Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 21.58 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 23.73
---
### BE (NEUTRAL (Bias Bearish))
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result Up / Preliminary Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
W5 volume remained high, but the spread was wide and the close was poor (CLV -0.21) near the high (155.86). This signals institutional selling (Preliminary Supply) is absorbing the remaining demand. Expect a markdown or significant consolidation.

**Key Levels:** 137.76 (Immediate Support), 155.87 (Supply High), 144.00 (W5 Open)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close below 137.76 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** Break and hold above 155.87
---
### BEP (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Demand / Consolidation

**Smart Money Logic:**
W3 established strong supply pressure, aligning with the bearish monthly context. W5 shows low volume and narrow spread, suggesting demand has dried up after the initial rebound (No Demand). Supply is likely waiting above.

**Key Levels:** 27.48 (W5 Low Support), 28.97 (W5 High/Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 27.48 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 28.97
---
### BKSY (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Consolidation / No Supply Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
W4 indicated supply appearing near the highs (Effort No Result). W5 is a pullback on reduced volume, suggesting supply is easing (No Supply). Demand successfully held the 24.00 area. Continuation of the markup phase is expected after this pause.

**Key Levels:** 23.90 (W5 Low Support), 29.79 (Supply Resistance), 27.53 (W4 Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close above 29.79 on high volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 23.90
---
### BRKR (BEARISH (Short-term reversal))
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Consolidation

**Smart Money Logic:**
W4 showed aggressive institutional selling (distribution) near the highs (56.22), reversing the momentum. W5 is a pause on reduced volume, indicating the supply is temporarily resting. The aggressive high-volume markdown setup suggests imminent continuation downwards.

**Key Levels:** 46.82 (W5 Low Support), 56.22 (Distribution High), 53.50 (W5 High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below 46.82 on volume.

---
### BSY (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Demand / Consolidation

**Smart Money Logic:**
W4 confirmed institutional supply overwhelming demand near 40.65. W5 is a narrow consolidation on average volume, indicating a lack of renewed buying interest (No Demand). The bearish trend is likely to continue shortly.

**Key Levels:** 37.55 (W5 Low Support), 40.66 (Supply Resistance), 38.73 (W4 Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 37.55 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 40.66
---
### BWIN (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Reassertion / Weakness Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
W5 showed clear supply dominance with a wide spread and low close (CLV -0.75), immediately reversing the strength seen in W3/W4. This confirms the presence of institutional sellers, aligning with the bearish context.

**Key Levels:** 24.89 (W5 Low Support), 26.81 (W5 High/Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 24.89 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 26.81
---
### BXSL (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Demand / Range Weakness

**Smart Money Logic:**
The failure to break out above 27.00 despite high volume efforts (W3) suggests supply absorption is active. W5's low volume, weak close confirms a lack of aggressive demand (No Demand), aligning with the overall bearish trend. Expect a break down from the recent consolidation range.

**Key Levels:** 25.90 (W5 Low Support), 27.06 (Range High/Resistance), 25.56 (W4 Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below 25.90 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 26.65 (W4 High)
---
### CCOI (BEARISH (Counter-trend failure likely))
**VSA Status:** No Demand / Weak Markup

**Smart Money Logic:**
Despite recent bullish price action (W3-W5), the volume remains critically low, indicating a severe lack of follow-through demand (No Demand). This vulnerability, especially in the context of a confirmed monthly Buying Climax, suggests sellers are waiting for a breakdown.

**Key Levels:** 22.79 (W5 Low Support), 25.05 (W5 High/Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below 22.79 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 25.05
---
### CELC (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result (W4) / Weak Reaction Rally (W5)

**Smart Money Logic:**
W4 showed aggressive supply absorption (Effort No Result) near 116, confirming the monthly Supply Dominance. W5 is a low volume, weak attempt at recovery (No Demand/Failed Test). Expect markdown continuation from institutional sellers.

**Key Levels:** 116.44 (Supply High), 103.00 (W5 Low Support), 106.96 (W4 Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below 103.00 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 112.69 (W5 High)
---
### CMPO (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Followed by Weakness)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Massive volume spike on 01/12 (RelVol 3.54) indicated aggressive distribution by Smart Money into retail excitement. Subsequent high volume/low CLV bar (01/19) confirms supply dominance following the climax.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 25.95, Support: 24.28

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 24.28 (Low of 01/19 bar).
- **Invalidation:** Above 25.95
---
### CPNG (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Strong Bearish Continuation)

**Smart Money Logic:**
High volume has consistently driven price lower (01/12 RelVol 2.07, low CLV -0.61). No stopping volume is evident, confirming institutional dumping and markdown continuation.

#### Action Plan

- **Invalidation:** Above 23.65
---
### CRBG (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result / Redistribution (Range Bound)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The price is trapped in a tight range after a strong rally. High volume (01/12) failed to expand the range or close strongly, suggesting ongoing distribution/redistribution by Smart Money in a bearish quarterly context.

**Key Levels:** Range High: 31.50, Range Low: 29.35

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short on break below 29.35.
- **Invalidation:** Above 31.50
---
### DOW (NEUTRAL/BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result / Potential Distribution

**Smart Money Logic:**
The rally attempted on 01/12 and 01/19 struggled (high volume, poor CLV), indicating supply pressure neutralizing demand near the 29.00 level. Expect a reactionary dip to clear this supply.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 29.09, Support: 26.07

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry below 27.57.
- **Invalidation:** Above 29.09
---
### DUOL (NEUTRAL/BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Preliminary Stopping Volume (Reactionary Demand)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Following a deep markdown (01/12), the week 01/19 showed strong rejection of the lows (142.10) on high volume (RelVol 0.96), closing aggressively near the high. This signals initial Smart Money absorption.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 170.09, Support: 142.10

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Buy above 161.28 or a low volume test of 147.00 area.
- **Invalidation:** Below 142.10
---
### FER (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Upthrust/Struggle (Consolidation/Pullback anticipated)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The market is range bound after a major monthly shakeout (Dec 2025). Recent weekly bars show struggle and poor closes (01/05, 01/19) near the highs, suggesting supply needs further clearance despite the bullish quarterly context.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 68.54, Support: 65.55

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a successful low volume test (No Supply) around 66.00.
- **Invalidation:** Below 64.30
---
### GNTX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result / Supply Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
High volume on 01/12 (RelVol 1.21) failed to produce a strong upward result (CLV -0.01). This neutralizes demand and suggests distribution at the highs. Subsequent weakness confirms supply entry.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 24.79, Support: 23.34

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short upon break below 23.34.
- **Invalidation:** Above 24.79
---
### GWRE (NEUTRAL/BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Preliminary Stopping Volume (Reactionary Demand)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Following aggressive markdown (01/12), the bar on 01/19 saw institutional demand step in aggressively, rejecting the low of 154.50 and closing strongly (CLV 0.74) on high volume. Expect a counter-trend rally.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 185.07, Support: 154.50

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Buy on continuation above 160.85.
- **Invalidation:** Below 154.50
---
### HPE (NEUTRAL/BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Preliminary Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
After severe markdown, the 01/19 bar saw high volume reject the low (20.07) and close in the mid-range (CLV 0.04). This indicates institutional absorption and a potential temporary halt to the markdown.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 22.71, Support: 20.07

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a successful No Supply test or break above 21.93.
- **Invalidation:** Below 20.07
---
### HRMY (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Confirmation / Weak Rally

**Smart Money Logic:**
The strong reversal on 01/12 (low CLV -0.34) confirms supply entering the market. The subsequent bounce on 01/19 occurred on low volume (RelVol 0.57), suggesting supply remains overhead and the markdown is likely to continue.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 39.40, Support: 35.16

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short on break below 35.16.
- **Invalidation:** Above 39.40
---
### INVH (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Test of Demand / Successful Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
Confirmed Stopping Volume (01/05 absorption followed by 01/12 strong demand). The latest bar (01/19) is a slight pullback on lower volume (RelVol 0.70), indicating a potentially healthy test of demand before continuation.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 28.34, Support: 25.29

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Buy above 27.78 or upon a definitive No Supply signal near 27.00.
- **Invalidation:** Below 25.29
---
### KDP (NEUTRAL/BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result / Potential Redistribution

**Smart Money Logic:**
High volume on 01/12 failed to produce an upward result, closing near the low (CLV -0.82). This signals supply absorbing demand in a tight range, consistent with distribution capped by the monthly Buying Climax alert.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 28.36, Support: 27.07

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short upon break below 27.07.
- **Invalidation:** Above 28.36
---
### LQDA (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Upthrust / Effort No Result

**Smart Money Logic:**
High volume on 01/12 failed to maintain the high spike (41.56), resulting in a poor close (CLV -0.01). This Upthrust suggests supply is absorbing demand at the peak, leading to distribution despite the recent bullish run.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 42.46, Support: 37.67

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short on break below 37.67.
- **Invalidation:** Above 42.46
---
### MAN (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Confirmation / Weak Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
The reversal on 01/12 (low CLV -0.39) confirmed supply entry. The subsequent bounce on 01/19 lacked volume conviction (RelVol 0.67) and closed weakly (CLV 0.30), indicating supply is still in control for a short-term markdown.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 31.61, Support: 28.82

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short on break below 28.82.
- **Invalidation:** Above 31.61
---
### OC (NEUTRAL/BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Upthrust / Potential Distribution

**Smart Money Logic:**
Following a strong markup phase, the price spiked to a new high (126.91) on 01/19 but immediately reversed, closing poorly (CLV 0.27). This indicates supply is entering the market (Upthrust).

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 126.92, Support: 119.91

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short on break below 122.02 (01/19 open).
- **Invalidation:** Above 126.92
---
### QQQI (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Distribution in Trading Range (Chop)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stock is tightly range-bound. High volume on 01/12 with a flat close (Effort No Result) suggests supply is capping price movement, indicative of distribution within the 52.78-54.19 trading range.

**Key Levels:** TR Resistance: 54.19, TR Support: 52.78

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short on decisive break below 52.78.
- **Invalidation:** Above 54.19
---
### RARE (BULLISH (Short-Term Rebound Potential))
**VSA Status:** Demand Test after Selling Climax (SC)

**Smart Money Logic:**
RARE experienced a massive Selling Climax (SC) in December, confirmed by the huge monthly volume (RelVol 2.57) and wide spread down, but the subsequent January monthly bar showed a reduction in spread and increased CLV (0.42), indicating demand absorption. The last weekly bar ('2026-01-19') closed strong (CLV 0.74) on elevated volume (RelVol 1.13), suggesting a successful reaction/test of the demand base established after the SC. This is a follow-through move confirming underlying strength amidst the BEARISH_TREND context.

**Key Levels:** 22.00 (Immediate Support/Test Zone), 25.09 (Recent High Resistance), 34.00 (Major Supply Zone)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Sustained break and hold above 24.60 (High of the last two reaction weeks).
- **Invalidation:** Close below 22.00
---
### RF (NEUTRAL/WEAKENING)
**VSA Status:** Weak Close on Elevated Volume (Effort No Result Down)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Despite being in a BULLISH_TREND quarterly context, the last two weekly bars show concerning weakness. The week of '2026-01-12' had elevated volume (RelVol 0.87) but closed poorly (CLV -0.32). The most recent week ('2026-01-19') saw high volume (RelVol 0.68) on a wide spread down (1.73), closing near the low (CLV -0.73). This is classic Effort No Result Down (or potentially Upthrust after Distribution on the highest weekly bar volume of the last 5 weeks on '01-12'), suggesting smart money is distributing into rallies or failing to support the price aggressively. Requires confirmation of supply dominance.

**Key Levels:** 27.25 (Immediate Support/Test Zone), 28.52 (Mid-range Resistance), 29.26 (Key High Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on break below 27.25, targeting previous support.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 28.61 (High of preceding weak bar)

### RGLD (BULLISH (Caution advised))
**VSA Status:** Climactic Demand/Continuation Thrust

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stock is in a strong BULLISH_TREND and the last three weekly bars show significant upward thrust on high volume, confirming strong demand absorption and continuation. The last bar ('2026-01-19') is a very wide spread UP bar on high volume (RelVol 0.83) closing near the high (CLV 0.93), pushing prices aggressively toward $300. While extremely bullish, the consecutive wide spreads suggest climatic activity (potential Buying Climax), meaning we must watch for immediate signs of professional selling (Upthrust/Reverse Thrust Down).

**Key Levels:** 265.12 (Immediate Support), 274.89 (Last Open/Minor Support), 293.95 (Recent High/Target)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A small pullback (Test) to 270-275 area on low volume, or a decisive break above 294.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 265.00

### RKT (NEUTRAL/WEAKENING)
**VSA Status:** Supply Absorption / Pullback in Uptrend

**Smart Money Logic:**
Following the strong rally three weeks ago (high volume, high CLV 0.92), the market is now reacting to that strength. The last week ('2026-01-19') saw wide spread down on strong volume (RelVol 0.637) closing mid-low (CLV -0.49). This suggests profit-taking or supply entering. However, given the Quarterly BULLISH_TREND, this bar might represent a test of the demand established below $22. If demand holds, the market could spring back up. The volume is high enough to suggest Smart Money involvement, likely distributing temporarily.

**Key Levels:** 20.53 (Strong Support), 22.42 (Previous Low Support), 24.36 (Major Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry on No Demand bar formation near 20.53, or short entry on sustained break below 20.50.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 20.50

### SPOT (NEUTRAL (Awaiting Confirmation))
**VSA Status:** Demand Test after Selling Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
SPOT is deep in a Quarterly BEARISH_TREND, recently experiencing Supply Dominance. The last two weekly bars show climatic selling, but the most recent bar ('2026-01-19') is a narrow spread UP bar on high volume (RelVol 1.29), closing near the high (CLV 0.70). This suggests significant absorption of supply and a successful first test of the prior lows (491.29). We need a second, lower volume test (No Supply) to confirm accumulation before considering a significant long entry.

**Key Levels:** 491.30 (Major Low/Accumulation Zone), 516.98 (Immediate Resistance), 539.37 (Supply Line)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry on confirmed No Supply signal above $491.30, targeting $539.37.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 490.00
---
### TRU (NEUTRAL/WEAKENING)
**VSA Status:** Test of Supply (Successful Retracement)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly context signaled a STRONG STOPPING_VOLUME, suggesting accumulation. The last weekly bar ('2026-01-19') is a wide spread down on average volume (RelVol 0.57), closing near the low (CLV -0.045). This bar appears to be a downside Test following the rally two weeks prior. The volume is not climatic, suggesting controlled selling or profit taking, not a full abandonment. Given the strong monthly stopping volume, we must monitor for demand to re-emerge.

**Key Levels:** 81.71 (Support/Test Low), 86.22 (Immediate Resistance), 89.12 (Supply Zone)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Long entry on a No Supply bar or break above 86.36.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 81.70

### WGMI (NEUTRAL/BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Pullback/Test after Strong Rally

**Smart Money Logic:**
WGMI is in a BULLISH_TREND with a recent monthly BUYING_CLIMAX warning. The previous week showed a massive thrust up on high volume. The current week ('2026-01-19') is a wide spread down bar on above-average volume (RelVol 0.86), but it managed to close mid-high (CLV 0.37). This suggests a strong effort to shake out weak holders after the initial thrust, but the price held up well above the open, showing underlying support. This is likely a Test in preparation for continuation, rather than immediate distribution.

**Key Levels:** 45.11 (Immediate Support/Test Low), 48.68 (Last Open Support), 51.78 (Recent High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and hold above 50.00.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 45.10
---
### WRB (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Confirmed Supply Continuation

**Smart Money Logic:**
WRB is in a BEARISH_TREND and Monthly SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The last three weekly bars show decreasing spread and volume but prices continually closing in the lower half (CLV consistently negative: -0.73, -0.71, -0.31). The last bar ('2026-01-19') is a narrow spread down bar on average volume (RelVol 0.80) closing mid-low. This indicates persistent weakness and a failure to rally significantly against the existing supply, confirming the continued presence of distribution/supply.

**Key Levels:** 66.50 (Immediate Support), 68.63 (Last Open/Resistance), 71.08 (Supply Line)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on break below 66.50, or rally towards 68.00 on low volume (No Demand).
- **Invalidation:** Close above 68.44
