## 🚀 Ready for Entry
### AGIO (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume Test/Rally

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly context is BEARISH, but the Monthly chart suggests Stopping Volume in November/December. The last week is a strong up bar, closing near the high (CLV 0.60) on below-average volume (RelVol 0.63). This suggests demand is returning after the low volume Test of $26.25, confirming the prior strength is being tested and absorbed. The price is showing strength relative to its prior down moves.

**Key Levels:** 26.25 (Key Test Level/Support), 29.10 (Immediate Resistance), 30.04 (Prior Swing High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 29.10 on increased volume (long entry).
- **Invalidation:** 26.25 (Close below low of the test area)
---
### AIG (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Confirmed Weakness

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last two weekly bars show heavy selling. The weekly bar two weeks ago had extremely high volume (RelVol 1.80) with a wide spread down, closing near the low (CLV -0.92) - a stopping/selling climax event. The subsequent week was a narrow-spread down bar on lower volume (RelVol 0.73) with a close near the low (CLV -0.13), failing to bounce. This confirms supply dominance and lack of demand absorption. The Quarterly trend is BEARISH.

**Key Levels:** 75.05 (Immediate Resistance), 71.25 (New Low/Support), 87.29 (Major Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 71.25 on volume (short entry).
- **Invalidation:** 76.04 (Close above the high of the reaction bar)
---
### ALC (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume Test/Re-accumulation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart confirmed Stopping Volume in January. The last three weeks show a sequence of lower CLV bars followed by a positive test: the last bar is an up bar with a neutral/positive CLV (0.045) on average volume (RelVol 0.74). The market successfully dipped below $78 and sprang back, suggesting absorption. This looks like a healthy re-accumulation phase within a BULLISH Quarterly trend.

**Key Levels:** 82.50 (Resistance), 78.26 (Immediate Support/Spring), 76.74 (Stopping Volume Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 81.65 on volume (long entry).
- **Invalidation:** 77.88 (Close below prior week's low)
---
### ALL (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Confirmed Weakness

**Smart Money Logic:**
Similar to AIG, this stock exhibits clear supply. Two weeks ago was a massive down bar on extreme volume (RelVol 2.04), closing near the low (CLV -0.94), indicating Selling Climax/Distribution. The subsequent week (last week) was an inside bar on high volume (RelVol 0.90) with a narrow spread, failing to rebound significantly and closing neutrally (CLV 0.01). This suggests demand is failing to push price higher after the supply spike. Quarterly trend is BEARISH.

**Key Levels:** 215.00 (Distribution Peak), 191.13 (Selling Climax Low/Support), 203.82 (Intermediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 191.13 on volume (short entry).
- **Invalidation:** 196.09 (Close above the high of the reaction bar)
---
### AMBA (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result (Supply)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stock has been attempting a weak rally since the major drop in November. The January rally (RelVol 1.81) resulted in a wide down bar closing near the low (CLV -0.88), classic Effort No Result. The last bar, on average volume (RelVol 0.74), was also a wide down bar closing near the low (CLV -0.36). This confirms persistent supply in a BEARISH Quarterly Context. Demand is weak below $71.40.

**Key Levels:** 71.40 (Immediate Resistance), 65.24 (Immediate Support), 64.00 (Major Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 65.24 on volume (short entry).
- **Invalidation:** 70.77 (Close above prior week's high)
---
### AMH (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume Test/Absorption

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly chart indicates Stopping Volume in January, supported by a high volume spike (RelVol 2.52) resulting in a wide spread down bar, but closing well off the lows (CLV 0.14). The following week confirmed demand with a strong close (CLV 0.90). The last week is a low volume Test (RelVol 0.95) with a narrow spread and neutral close (CLV 0.07). This sequence suggests absorption is successful and the market is preparing for an advance in line with the BULLISH Quarterly Context.

**Key Levels:** 32.65 (Resistance), 31.50 (Immediate Support/Test Level), 30.51 (Stopping Volume Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 32.41 on volume (long entry).
- **Invalidation:** 31.50 (Close below the low of the test bar)
---
### ARE (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Sign of Strength (SOS)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Following a potential Monthly Stopping Volume (CLV 0.55), the last two weekly bars are excellent Signs of Strength. Wide spread up, closing near the high (CLV 0.90 then 0.96), on above-average volume (RelVol 1.20, 0.95). This indicates strong professional demand absorbing prior supply and pushing the price higher, confirming the BULLISH Quarterly Context. The range break is confirmed.

**Key Levels:** 59.76 (New High/Resistance), 56.01 (Immediate Support), 53.15 (Spring/Test Level)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Pullback to 57.00 (lower risk) or break above 59.76 (higher risk long entry).
- **Invalidation:** 56.00 (Close below the consolidation support)
---
### ARES (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Confirmed Distribution

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart shows a Buying Climax. The last weekly bar is a wide spread down bar on average volume (RelVol 0.64), closing near the absolute low (CLV -0.97). This signals major weakness and confirmed distribution after the $177 peak. The high volume spike in December (RelVol 3.08) led to a massive failure in January (Monthly CLV -0.99). Smart money is selling into the rally.

**Key Levels:** 177.72 (Distribution Peak), 155.74 (New Low/Support), 167.22 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 155.74 on volume (short entry).
- **Invalidation:** 170.22 (Close above the last reaction high)
---
### AS (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Test/Sign of Strength

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly context is BULLISH, despite a confirmed Monthly Supply Dominance in December (CLV -0.22) followed by a neutral January close (CLV 0.04). The last weekly bar is a strong up bar on increased volume (RelVol 0.80), closing near the high (CLV 0.98). This is a strong rebound from the low, suggesting demand has absorbed supply. This looks like a successful Test of the range bottom/demand level.

**Key Levels:** 38.73 (Immediate Resistance), 35.54 (Test Low/Support), 36.12 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 38.73 on volume (long entry).
- **Invalidation:** 35.54 (Close below the low of the test bar)
---
### AVAV (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Confirmed Distribution

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart flags a Buying Climax. The last two weeks saw extreme volatility following a massive SOS bar on 1/5. The latest bar is a wide spread down on high volume (RelVol 1.44), closing near the absolute low (CLV -0.82). This is a severe reversal and confirms distribution near the highs of $408. Smart money is dumping shares after the euphoric rise.

**Key Levels:** 408.25 (Distribution Peak), 300.00 (Immediate Support), 346.47 (Intermediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 300.00 on volume (short entry).
- **Invalidation:** 390.04 (Close above the high of the distribution bar)
---
### AXTI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Severe Reversal

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart indicates a Buying Climax, amplified by a spectacular high volume spike in January (RelVol 3.82) that led to an immediate reversal. The last weekly bar is a massive wide spread down on high volume (RelVol 1.28), closing near the absolute low (CLV -0.86). This is a clear Supply Dominance event, completely engulfing the prior week's gains. This confirms major distribution at the top.

**Key Levels:** 26.66 (Distribution Peak), 17.01 (New Low/Support), 22.69 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 17.01 on volume (short entry).
- **Invalidation:** 22.69 (Close above the high of the supply bar)
---
### AZN (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume Test/Confirmed Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart suggests Stopping Volume. The week of 1/12 saw extremely high volume (RelVol 3.30) resulting in a wide spread down bar, but the close was neutral/negative (CLV -0.11), indicating selling absorption. The last bar is a strong rebound on quiet volume (RelVol 1.08), wide spread up, closing near the high (CLV 0.97). This confirms the absorption was successful and the price is ready to move higher, validating the BULLISH Quarterly Context.

**Key Levels:** 96.51 (Resistance), 89.04 (Stopping Volume Low/Support), 90.14 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 94.65 on volume (long entry).
- **Invalidation:** 90.00 (Close below the opening of the last SOS bar)
---
### BANC (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Confirmed Distribution

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart CONFIRMED_STRONG a Buying Climax. The last weekly bar is a wide spread down bar on above-average volume (RelVol 0.97), closing near the absolute low (CLV -0.96). This is an immediate and strong reversal from the $21.61 peak. This confirms that smart money has distributed their holdings and the previous SOS bars were climactic buying.

**Key Levels:** 21.61 (Distribution Peak/Resistance), 19.89 (Immediate Support), 19.11 (Major Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 19.89 on volume (short entry).
- **Invalidation:** 20.80 (Close above prior week's close)
---
### BBWI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Reversal

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart confirmed Supply Dominance. The last weekly bar is a wide spread down on lower volume (RelVol 0.46), closing near the low (CLV -0.13). This confirms the prior week's drop was met with follow-through weakness. Despite the BULLISH Quarterly trend, the institutional distribution confirmed in December/January (Monthly CLV -0.18) suggests a short-term reversal or major top.

**Key Levels:** 23.73 (Resistance/Peak), 21.58 (Immediate Support), 22.48 (Intermediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 21.58 on volume (short entry).
- **Invalidation:** 23.27 (Close above prior week's close)
---
### BFH (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume Test/Selling Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart suggests Stopping Volume, but the last weekly bar contradicts demand. The week of 1/12 was a high volume bar (RelVol 2.26) with a wide spread down, but closed strongly off the low (CLV 0.86) - a potential spring. However, the last bar is a wide spread down on much lower volume (RelVol 0.73), closing near the absolute low (CLV -0.91). This suggests the bounce failed immediately, and supply re-emerged heavily. The stopping volume was likely weak. Despite BULLISH Quarterly Context, VSA signals strong short-term weakness.

**Key Levels:** 74.17 (Intermediate Resistance), 68.57 (New Low/Support), 67.78 (Major Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 68.57 on volume (short entry).
- **Invalidation:** 73.76 (Close above the high of the weak bar)
---
### BKKT (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Confirmed Distribution

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last two weeks represent a classic failure after a sharp rally. The week of 1/12 was an Effort to Rise on high volume (RelVol 1.05), closing strongly (CLV 0.78). However, the immediate reaction last week was a wide spread down bar on average volume (RelVol 0.78), closing near the low (CLV -0.72). This signals heavy professional selling (Distribution) immediately overwhelming the prior demand. The overall Quarterly trend is BEARISH.

**Key Levels:** 22.11 (Distribution Peak/Resistance), 14.50 (New Low/Support), 15.50 (Intermediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 14.50 on volume (short entry).
- **Invalidation:** 19.78 (Close above the high of the supply bar)
---
### BRZE (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Confirmed Distribution

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart confirmed a Buying Climax. The week of 1/12 was a massive down bar on extreme volume (RelVol 1.55), closing near the low (CLV -0.95), confirming major distribution/Selling Climax. The latest bar attempts a rebound but closes only slightly positive (CLV 0.40) on high volume (RelVol 1.21), failing to overcome significant resistance. This indicates supply still dominates, consistent with the BEARISH Quarterly Context.

**Key Levels:** 30.45 (Intermediate Resistance), 22.66 (New Low/Support), 34.53 (Distribution Peak)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 22.66 on volume (short entry).
- **Invalidation:** 26.17 (Close above the high of the reaction bar)
---
### CADE (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Confirmed Distribution

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart flags a Buying Climax. The last weekly bar is a wide spread down on high volume (RelVol 1.13), closing near the absolute low (CLV -0.98). This is a strong signal of professional distribution overwhelming demand, reversing the rally from the previous weeks. The move into $46.74 appears exhausted. The sharp, high-volume rejection confirms the short-term weakness.

**Key Levels:** 46.74 (Distribution Peak/Resistance), 42.88 (New Low/Support), 44.50 (Intermediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 42.88 on volume (short entry).
- **Invalidation:** 44.87 (Close above prior week's high)
---
### CAI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume Failure / Confirmed Weakness

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart shows a Stopping Volume being watched, but the last weekly bar signals failure. The week of 1/12 saw extremely high volume (RelVol 2.05) with a wide spread down, closing neutrally (CLV -0.03), suggesting potential stopping volume. However, the next bar is a wide spread down on significantly lower volume (RelVol 1.08), closing near the absolute low (CLV -0.76). This confirms that demand failed to absorb the selling, and supply is driving the price lower, aligning with the BEARISH Quarterly Context.

**Key Levels:** 29.00 (Resistance), 24.74 (New Low/Support), 26.23 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 24.74 on volume (short entry).
- **Invalidation:** 26.96 (Close above the high of the supply bar)
---
### CNQ (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Strength Confirmation (Following Stopping Volume)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The deep pullback on 01/05 was met with significant Stopping Volume (RelVol 2.046, CLV 0.354), indicating strong institutional demand around 30.13. Immediate continuation in the following weeks confirms the strength of this buying. Smart money is now pushing the price higher in line with the bullish quarterly trend.

**Key Levels:** 36.28 (Resistance), 34.00 (Immediate Support), 30.13 (SV Major Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Breakout above 36.30 (weekly high) with high volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 34.00
---
### CNXC (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Sign of Strength (SOS) / Continuation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The wide spread, high volume rally on 01/12 marked a major Sign of Strength (SOS) confirming the bullish quarterly context. The subsequent week consolidated the gains, closing strongly near highs on lower volume, indicating that supply is currently light and Smart Money maintains control.

**Key Levels:** 44.78 (Resistance), 42.00 (Immediate Support), 37.85 (SOS Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and hold above 44.78.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 40.00
---
### FFIV (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (BC) / No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
The rally attempt on 01/12 was met with powerful selling pressure (high volume, poor CLV), signaling a Buying Climax near 280.75. The subsequent week, 01/19, confirmed this weakness with a down move on low volume (No Demand), indicating Smart Money distribution is complete or underway, leading to a high probability of a correction.

**Key Levels:** 280.75 (Major Resistance), 257.18 (Key Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and hold below 257.18 with confirming volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 275.15
---
### FIBK (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Weakness / Supply Reappearance

**Smart Money Logic:**
After reaching highs near 38.78, two successive weeks (01/12 and 01/19) confirmed supply entering the market. The wide spread down on 01/19, closing poorly (CLV -0.498), signals that sellers are taking control, indicating a short-term correction or the onset of distribution, consistent with the Monthly Buying Climax flag.

**Key Levels:** 38.78 (Resistance), 35.95 (Key Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 35.95 with volume confirmation.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 38.00
---
### FISV (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Successful Test / No Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
The high volume sell-off on 01/12 was immediately negated by a strong rally on 01/19. Crucially, this rally was achieved on low volume (RelVol 0.703) with a strong close (CLV 0.959), indicating that Smart Money successfully tested the market and found no willing sellers (No Supply). This sets the stage for a mark-up phase.

**Key Levels:** 70.41 (Resistance), 65.97 (Test Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Breakout above 70.41 with volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 65.97
---
### FRPT (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Sign of Strength (SOS) / Mark-Up Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
A strong, wide spread UP bar on 01/19, supported by high volume, confirms institutional commitment (SOS) and the strong continuation of the mark-up phase, following the confirmed monthly Stopping Volume. Demand is clearly dominant.

**Key Levels:** 72.99 (Resistance), 64.20 (Immediate Support), 60.97 (Major Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and hold above 73.00.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 64.20
---
### GBCI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (BC) / Upthrust

**Smart Money Logic:**
The bar on 01/19 displays classic climactic selling: high volume on a wide up spread with a weak close (CLV -0.321). This indicates major distribution by Smart Money near 50.92, overwhelming the bullish momentum. A short-term correction is highly probable.

**Key Levels:** 50.92 (Major Resistance), 47.86 (Immediate Support), 45.94 (Major Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 47.86 with volume confirmation.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 50.92
---
### GE (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Confirmed Weakness

**Smart Money Logic:**
The effort up on 01/05 resulted in an Upthrust (poor CLV). This weakness was confirmed dramatically on 01/19 with massive volume and a wide down spread closing near lows, signaling aggressive Supply Dominance by Smart Money. Continuation of the bearish move is expected toward previous support areas.

**Key Levels:** 332.79 (Resistance), 290.07 (Key Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and hold below 290.07.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 316.36
---
### GKOS (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Confirmed Weakness

**Smart Money Logic:**
The bar on 01/19 is a clear sign of weakness. Despite pushing up to 130.23, the price closed near the lows with a wide down spread, indicating heavy institutional distribution (Buying Climax/Upthrust). This aggressive selling negates the prior week's strength and suggests a sharp correction is imminent.

**Key Levels:** 130.23 (Major Resistance), 118.25 (Key Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and hold below 118.25.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 121.63
---
### IMAX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Weakness / Failed Rally

**Smart Money Logic:**
The strong Sign of Strength (SOS) on 01/12 was immediately negated by aggressive selling on 01/19. The wide down spread and poor close (CLV -0.825) confirms that supply quickly overwhelmed the brief institutional buying, indicating continued bearish control consistent with the quarterly trend.

**Key Levels:** 37.61 (Resistance), 34.30 (Key Support), 33.00 (Major Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 34.30 with confirming volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 37.61
---
### INVH (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Successful Test (No Supply)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Following the strong Sign of Strength (SOS) on 01/12, the market experienced a low volume pullback (01/19, RelVol 0.753), signaling a successful test where supply dried up. This confirms Smart Money absorption and prepares the groundwork for a continued mark-up, overriding the quarterly bearish trend in the short term.

**Key Levels:** 27.78 (Resistance), 26.94 (Immediate Support), 25.29 (SV Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and hold above 27.78.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 26.94
---
### IONQ (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Despite recent attempts to rally, the high volume, wide spread down bar on 01/19, closing near lows (CLV -0.635), confirms institutional selling is aggressively driving the price lower. Supply dominance is confirmed, aligning with the overall bearish quarterly trend and monthly climax signal.

**Key Levels:** 54.24 (Resistance), 45.69 (Key Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and hold below 45.69.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 51.91
---
### IOT (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Reappearance / Failed Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
Despite a high volume bounce on 01/12 (Stopping Volume), the weakness returned immediately on 01/19 with high volume (RelVol 1.034) driving the price lower and closing poorly. This suggests Smart Money distribution continues, overwhelming any initial buying attempts. The bearish quarterly trend remains intact.

**Key Levels:** 35.87 (Resistance), 31.25 (Major Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 31.25 with confirmation.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 34.90
---
### IREN (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Sign of Strength (SOS) / Continuation

**Smart Money Logic:**
Aggressive institutional buying on 01/12 established a strong Sign of Strength (SOS). The follow-through on 01/19, maintained on high volume (RelVol 1.024) and a strong close, confirms continuation in the mark-up phase, aligning with the bullish quarterly trend. Demand is dominant.

**Key Levels:** 58.75 (Resistance), 54.95 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and hold above 58.75.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 54.95
---
### ITT (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result Up (Distribution)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The bar on 01/19 showed a large price spread and solid volume but closed nearly flat (CLV 0.017), indicating major Effort No Result. This confirms that institutional selling absorbed demand aggressively near 187.65, signaling distribution is underway, supported by the monthly Supply Dominance flag.

**Key Levels:** 187.65 (Resistance), 180.48 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 180.48 with volume confirmation.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 187.65
---
### JPM (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Confirmed Weakness

**Smart Money Logic:**
The massive volume downside move on 01/12 confirmed Supply Dominance. This weakness was validated on 01/19 with another wide down bar closing near the lows (CLV -0.834). Smart Money is aggressively selling, confirming the bearish quarterly context and initiating a markdown phase.

**Key Levels:** 326.86 (Resistance), 296.51 (Key Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and hold below 296.51.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 311.15
---
### KEY (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result Up (Distribution)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Three consecutive weeks of high volume failing to push price sustainably higher, climaxing with the 01/19 bar (wide spread, high volume, nearly flat close). This indicates major institutional distribution (Effort No Result/Upthrust) near 22.07, setting up for a markdown phase, confirmed by the Monthly Supply Dominance signal.

**Key Levels:** 22.07 (Major Resistance), 20.97 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 20.97 with volume confirmation.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 22.07
---
### KYMR (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Weakness Confirmed / No Demand Rally

**Smart Money Logic:**
The sharp reversal and down bar on 01/12 confirmed supply dominance, likely initiating a markdown. The follow-up rally on 01/19 was weak (low CLV, low volume), signaling a lack of committed demand (No Demand). This validates the bearish reversal signal from the Monthly Buying Climax.

**Key Levels:** 76.71 (Resistance), 69.41 (Key Support), 66.21 (Major Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 69.41 with volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 74.77
---
### LHX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (BC) - Confirmed Early

**Smart Money Logic:**
The extreme volume and poor CLV on 01/12 signal a powerful Buying Climax near 361.59, marking the end of the mark-up phase and the start of distribution. Smart Money aggressively sold into retail enthusiasm. The subsequent week failed to negate this weakness.

**Key Levels:** 361.59 (Major Resistance), 340.28 (Key Support), 332.88 (Major Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and hold below 340.28.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 361.59
---
### MOD (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Strength Confirmation / Accumulation Phase D

**Smart Money Logic:**
Following the major Selling Climax on 01/05, the subsequent two weeks showed strong institutional buying (SOS sequence). The latest bar (01/19) confirms the continuation of strength, despite slightly lower volume, suggesting successful absorption and that the mark-up phase is underway, aiming to reverse the bearish quarterly trend.

**Key Levels:** 150.75 (Resistance), 132.80 (Immediate Support), 111.18 (SV Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and hold above 150.75.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 132.80
---
### NICE (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Successful Test / Absorption

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weakness shown on 01/12 (supply entry) was immediately negated by a strong, wide-spread rally on 01/19. This follow-through, achieved on average/lower volume and closing strongly (CLV 0.541), suggests a successful test/absorption phase. Smart Money has cleared the immediate supply and maintained bullish control.

**Key Levels:** 118.37 (Resistance), 109.30 (Test Low/Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and hold above 118.37.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 109.30
---
### OKLO (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Weakness Confirmed / Markdown

**Smart Money Logic:**
The rally attempt culminated in a Buying Climax on 01/05. Subsequent weeks, especially 01/19, confirmed bearish control with strong selling pressure (high volume, poor CLV), pushing the price into a clear markdown phase, validating the overall bearish context.

**Key Levels:** 107.60 (Resistance), 86.02 (Key Support), 115.72 (BC High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and hold below 86.02.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 97.00
---
### OZK (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Confirmed Weakness

**Smart Money Logic:**
The huge volume, wide down spread bar on 01/19, closing near the low, confirms aggressive institutional selling (Supply Dominance). This signifies a major reversal point following the preceding rally, indicating that Smart Money has entered a markdown phase from the 49.69 high.

**Key Levels:** 49.69 (Major Resistance), 45.77 (Key Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and hold below 45.77.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 48.47
---
### PGY (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Weakness / No Demand Rally

**Smart Money Logic:**
The high volume sell-off on 01/12 confirmed institutional supply. The following rally attempt on 01/19 was weak (low volume, poor CLV), signaling No Demand. This confirms the ongoing bearish control, consistent with the quarterly trend and monthly supply warning.

**Key Levels:** 25.43 (Resistance), 21.62 (Immediate Support), 20.62 (Major Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and hold below 21.62.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 23.50
---
### QQQI (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Strength Confirmation / Absorption

**Smart Money Logic:**
The failure to close strongly on 01/12 was immediately followed by a powerful bounce on 01/19 (CLV 0.730), confirming that demand successfully absorbed the interim supply. The high volume confirmation indicates Smart Money commitment to continue the mark-up, overriding the earlier minor warning signs.

**Key Levels:** 54.19 (Resistance), 52.96 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and hold above 54.19.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 52.96
---
### RF (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result Down

**Smart Money Logic:**
Despite a BULLISH Quarterly context, the last two weekly bars show concerning weakness. The 01/12 bar was a down close on high volume (RelVol 0.87) with CLV -0.32, indicating supply entry. The latest bar (01/19) attempted to rally, but closed weakly (CLV -0.735) on high volume (RelVol 0.68), resulting in an Effort No Result Down against the underlying uptrend structure. This suggests Smart Money is distributing or shorting aggressively near the high 28s.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 28.61 (Recent high), Support: 27.25 (Latest low, key support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below 27.25 with elevated volume.
- **Invalidation:** Above 28.65 (Above recent weekly high)
---
### RGLD (STRONGLY BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Strong Sign of Strength/No Supply Confirmation Needed

**Smart Money Logic:**
This is a picture of exceptional strength in a BULLISH trend. The last three weekly bars are massive up bars, all closing near their highs (CLV > 0.77) on high volume, confirming strong demand and commitment from Smart Money. The latest weekly bar (01/19) had the widest spread and highest CLV, despite slightly lower RelVol (0.836), indicating sustained momentum and potential markdown of sellers. The monthly candle also shows extreme strength (CLV 0.779, wide spread).

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 293.99 (Latest high), Support: 274.89 (Latest weekly open/minor pullback level)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry on a shallow pullback/Test of 275-280 zone with diminished volume.
- **Invalidation:** Below 265.00 (Below prior week's close)
---
### RLI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Confirmed Weakness/No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
The market is under pressure (Quarterly BEARISH, Monthly BUYING_CLIMAX watch). The last four weekly bars are down bars, all closing near or below the midpoint on high volume relative to the spread (wide spreads, negative CLVs). The latest bar (01/19) is a very wide spread down bar, closing near the low (CLV -0.485) on very high volume (RelVol 1.45), which confirms heavy selling pressure and supply follow-through. The price structure indicates continuous distribution and weakness.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 60.35 (Prior weekly high), Support: 55.80 (Latest low, primary bearish target)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and hold below 55.70.
- **Invalidation:** Above 60.50 (Above recent minor resistance)
---
### RTO (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** High Volume Upthrust/Buying

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BULLISH. The weekly chart shows strong demand accumulation. The last bar (01/19) is a wide spread UP bar closing near the high (CLV 0.839) on extreme volume (RelVol 2.51), confirming powerful demand. This week is classified as STOPPING_VOLUME/Sign of Strength, marking the end of the prior minor correction and an aggressive mark-up phase. Smart Money is aggressively buying.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 33.13 (Latest high, next target), Support: 31.54 (Prior weekly close, initial support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry upon consolidation/Test near 32.00 or break above 33.13.
- **Invalidation:** Below 30.76 (Below low of the high volume up bar)
---
### SA (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Strong Sign of Strength

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BULLISH. The latest weekly bar (01/19) is a highly significant wide spread UP bar, closing near the high (CLV 0.48) on high volume (RelVol 1.019). This move broke significantly above prior weekly resistance (32.30 area). Although the CLV isn't extreme, the wide spread and high volume confirm strong buying commitment, signaling a break out of a supply zone, despite the Monthly SUPPLY_DOMINANCE warning.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 37.99 (Latest high, immediate target), Support: 31.75 (Breakout level support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry on a test of 32.30 or continuation above 38.00.
- **Invalidation:** Below 31.70 (Failure to hold breakout support)
---
### SARO (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly chart shows extreme behavior classified as a BUYING_CLIMAX. The latest bar (01/19) is a massive volume spike (RelVol 3.72) on a wide spread UP bar, but the closing is significantly off the high (CLV 0.073). Smart Money is aggressively selling/distributing into this high volume rally. This suggests a failure of the momentum despite the BULLISH quarterly trend.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 34.48 (Climax high), Support: 31.22 (Low of Climax bar)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and sustained close below 31.20, confirming distribution.
- **Invalidation:** Above 34.50 (Failure of Selling Climax thesis)
---
### STAA (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Follow-Through

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly chart is confirming severe weakness in a BEARISH quarterly trend. The market was already watching for Stopping Volume, but the latest bar (01/19) provided the opposite: a wide spread DOWN bar closing near the low (CLV -0.927) on moderately high volume (RelVol 0.96). This is clear supply continuation, suggesting failure of the prior Stopping Volume attempts and a continued markdown phase.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 21.27 (Prior consolidation high), Support: 19.06 (Latest low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and hold below 19.00 with follow-through volume.
- **Invalidation:** Above 21.00 (Requires significant rally attempt to invalidate)
---
### SYF (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Continuation/Effort No Result Up

**Smart Money Logic:**
The market attempted a rally (01/12 wide up bar on high volume, VSA status STOPPING_VOLUME). However, the latest weekly bar (01/19) is a wide spread DOWN bar closing heavily into the low (CLV -0.402) on high volume (RelVol 1.15). This failure suggests the previous week's buying was absorbed by major supply, and the mark-down is continuing, dominating the current BULLISH quarterly context. Smart Money is distributing heavily near the recent highs.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 80.19 (Prior weekly close), Support: 74.95 (Recent low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below 74.90.
- **Invalidation:** Above 80.20 (Recapturing prior demand close)
---
### TFX (STRONGLY BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Continuation/No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly chart shows relentless supply pressure (SUPPLY_DOMINANCE status). The last two weeks featured sharp down moves on high volume. The latest bar (01/19) is an UP bar attempt, but the spread is wide, volume is high (RelVol 1.09), and the bar closes poorly (CLV -0.063). This suggests selling pressure is overwhelming any attempt to rally, indicating 'No Demand' on the bounce. This confirms supply control and a potential markdown continuation. Quarterly trend is BEARISH.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 107.06 (Latest weekly high), Support: 100.18 (Latest low, key psychological level)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and hold below 100.00.
- **Invalidation:** Above 107.50 (Above recent supply area)
---
### USIG (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply/High Volume Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
This is a low volatility, tight consolidation zone, but the underlying context is BULLISH Quarterly. The latest bar (01/19) is an UP bar closing strong (CLV 0.944) on moderately high volume (RelVol 0.96). The price structure shows demand absorption around 51.65. The high CLV suggests smart money is pressing the price higher, despite the prior week's high volume down close. The range is extremely tight, indicating controlled movement.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 52.12 (Recent high), Support: 51.65 (Recent low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close above 52.15 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** Below 51.60 (Break of tight support range)
---
### VONG (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Spring/Shakeout

**Smart Money Logic:**
Despite the BEARISH quarterly trend (ETFs often lag), the weekly chart shows positive VSA characteristics. The 01/12 bar was a wide spread down bar on extreme volume (RelVol 2.51), piercing below the 121.32 support level. The latest bar (01/19) is a sharp UP reversal, closing strong (CLV 0.709) on lower volume (RelVol 1.18). This setup resembles a Spring or Shakeout: trapping bears below support, followed by a quick reversal. Smart Money is absorbing supply and marking up.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 123.59 (Prior consolidation high), Support: 117.63 (Spring low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry upon closing above 121.50 (confirming spring action).
- **Invalidation:** Below 117.60 (Failure of the spring)
---
### WRB (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Continuation/No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BEARISH. The last four weekly bars show consistent supply presence. The latest bar (01/19) is a narrow spread UP bar closing in the middle (CLV -0.318) on average volume (RelVol 0.84). This attempts a rally off the low but fails to show meaningful demand commitment, qualifying as 'No Demand'. This confirms the dominance of supply and sets up a continuation of the markdown phase.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 68.32 (Latest weekly high), Support: 66.50 (Latest weekly low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below 66.50 on volume confirmation.
- **Invalidation:** Above 68.35 (Invalidates No Demand thesis)
---
## 👀 Watch/Monitoring
### ABVX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Reversal

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence indicates a Buying Climax CONFIRMED_EARLY. The previous high volume weeks (RelVol 1.73, 1.93) resulted in closing off the highs, followed by the most recent bar (RelVol 0.66) which failed to maintain the uptrend, showing a sharp drop from Open ($119.88) and closing neutrally, but off the highs. The overall Quarterly trend is BEARISH, making Buying Climax reliable. Smart money is distributing near the highs ~$130-148, which peaked in early January. The recent consolidation (low RelVol) is likely a temporary reaction.

**Key Levels:** 130.13 (Intermediate Resistance), 113.64 (Immediate Support), 108.95 (Major Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below the most recent weekly low (113.64) on increased volume (short entry).
- **Invalidation:** 130.13 (Close above intermediate resistance)
---
### ACLX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Although the Quarterly context is BULLISH, the last weekly bar exhibited high volume (RelVol 1.51) with an extremely wide spread up, yet the close was near the absolute low (CLV -0.67). This is classic Supply Dominance (High Effort, Poor Result), indicating selling absorption near the week's high of $76.50. This confirms the Monthly SUPPLY_DOMINANCE status. Prior week's close at $68.94 failed immediately.

**Key Levels:** 76.50 (Selling Climax High), 66.00 (Immediate Support), 60.35 (Major Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 66.00 (short entry).
- **Invalidation:** 76.50 (Close above the high of the supply bar)
---
### ACN (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Neutral/Stopping Volume Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly chart flagged Stopping Volume in January (CLV 0.37, average RelVol). The last week was an inside bar on lower volume (RelVol 0.78) with a narrow spread and a neutral close (CLV 0.05). This suggests a pause after the significant up move from $260 to $289. The structure needs to confirm whether the prior stopping volume leads to a full Test (low volume pullback) or if supply re-emerges.

**Key Levels:** 291.09 (Recent High/Resistance), 272.22 (Immediate Support), 258.00 (Stopping Volume Low/Major Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 289.00 on strong volume (long entry) OR sharp drop below 272.22 (short opportunity).
- **Invalidation:** 291.09 (Short-term high)
---
### AIQ (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Test/Sign of Strength

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart shows Stopping Volume being watched for a Test. The last weekly bar is a significant Sign of Strength: wide spread up, closing near the high (CLV 0.80) on average volume (RelVol 0.90). This confirms demand absorption after the prior week's low CLV (-0.28). The price is moving back towards the high of the range ($53.25) under quiet accumulation, which aligns with the BULLISH Quarterly Context.

**Key Levels:** 53.25 (Resistance), 51.83 (Immediate Support), 50.87 (Major Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 53.25 on high volume (long entry).
- **Invalidation:** 51.22 (Close below the open of the SOS bar)
---
### AL (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Ultra Low Volume / Weak Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly chart indicates a Buying Climax, but the weekly volume levels are extremely low (RelVol 0.22 to 0.71), suggesting minimal institutional interest. The spreads are very narrow, oscillating between $64 and $64.47. The last bar is an up bar on low volume, closing near the high (CLV 0.47). This quiet activity at the high of the range suggests either tight accumulation or simply a lack of conviction (professional absence). Until a wider spread/higher volume bar appears, the structure is drifting.

**Key Levels:** 64.47 (Range High), 64.07 (Range Low), 63.42 (Monthly Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 64.50 on volume (long entry) or break below 64.07 (short entry).
- **Invalidation:** 64.00 (Close below range support)
---
### AMZU (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result (Rally Failure)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The January rally spiked on volume (RelVol 1.08) but immediately reversed (CLV 0.94 to CLV -0.59), signaling supply near $40. The most recent bar is an up bar on lower volume (RelVol 0.75) with a high CLV (0.80), but it failed to surpass the prior week's high ($40.40). This looks like an upthrust or a minor rally failure within the larger BEARISH Quarterly Context. Needs more volume or a clear high-volume break of $40 to confirm strength.

**Key Levels:** 40.40 (Resistance/Upthrust), 37.05 (Immediate Support), 33.08 (Major Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 36.35 on volume (short entry) OR strong break above 40.40 (long entry).
- **Invalidation:** 40.40 (Close above the high of the trading range)
---
### ARWR (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Failure

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence confirmed Supply Dominance. The week of 1/5 saw massive volume (RelVol 2.19) with a wide spread down, closing near the low (CLV -0.51), confirming professional supply. The latest bar attempts a rebound but closes neutrally (CLV 0.13) on quiet volume (RelVol 0.63) after a wide spread up. This suggests the rally failed to absorb the massive supply from the previous drop. The January Monthly CLV is negative (-0.23).

**Key Levels:** 71.16 (Immediate Resistance), 61.65 (Immediate Support), 60.62 (Distribution Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 61.65 on volume (short entry).
- **Invalidation:** 71.16 (Close above the high of the last rally attempt)
---
### AXTA (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Neutral/Absorption

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart suggests Stopping Volume, indicating potential absorption. The last two weekly bars show a high CLV (0.90, then 0.19) on solid volume (RelVol 1.35, then 0.62). The price is holding firm near the range high ($34.20). The slightly lower CLV last week suggests some profit-taking or minor supply, but demand remains in control, especially given the BULLISH Quarterly Context.

**Key Levels:** 34.20 (Resistance), 32.76 (Immediate Support), 31.61 (Major Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 34.20 on high volume (long entry).
- **Invalidation:** 32.76 (Close below the low of the last two weeks)
---
### BABX (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume/Rally Attempt

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH, but the stock is attempting to reverse. The January monthly bar shows a positive CLV (0.38) despite the BEARISH context. The last weekly bar is a wide spread up on lower volume (RelVol 0.84), closing in the middle (CLV 0.15). The prior week was a high volume spike (RelVol 1.32) which closed weakly (CLV -0.06). Volatility suggests indecision, but the price is attempting to rally off the 41.00 level. Needs confirmation of demand strength.

**Key Levels:** 53.35 (Resistance), 41.00 (Immediate Support), 35.25 (Monthly Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 50.00 on strong volume (long entry) OR sharp drop below 41.00 (short entry).
- **Invalidation:** 41.00 (Close below support)
---
### BAH (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart flags a Buying Climax. The weekly sequence shows strong upward movement, culminating in the last bar which is extremely wide spread up on the highest recent volume (RelVol 1.06), but the close is significantly off the high (CLV 0.13). This is classic Buying Climax/Effort No Result, suggesting professional supply met the buying effort near $109. The prior high volume bar also closed strongly (CLV 0.88), indicating a shift in momentum.

**Key Levels:** 109.10 (Climax Peak/Resistance), 93.28 (Immediate Support), 96.73 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 96.00 on volume (short entry).
- **Invalidation:** 109.10 (Close above the climax bar high)
---
### BBIO (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume Test/Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart indicates Stopping Volume. The week of 1/12 saw high volume (RelVol 2.03) with a wide spread down, yet the close was neutral (CLV 0.18), showing absorption. The last bar is a narrow-spread up bar on lower volume (RelVol 0.89), with a neutral/positive CLV (0.08). This suggests a positive Test (low volume pullback absorbed successfully) and continued institutional interest within a BULLISH Quarterly Context.

**Key Levels:** 81.32 (Resistance), 73.77 (Immediate Support), 70.95 (Stopping Volume Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 79.88 on volume (long entry).
- **Invalidation:** 73.77 (Close below the low of the test bar)
---
### BBT (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result (Supply)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart flags a Buying Climax. The last weekly bar is a wide spread up on average volume (RelVol 0.75), but the close is significantly off the high (CLV -0.04). This suggests supply absorption near the $29.62 high (Effort No Result). The overall structure is consolidating near the top of the range. Needs a clear break or strong selling confirmation.

**Key Levels:** 29.63 (Resistance/Climax), 27.00 (Immediate Support), 26.47 (Prior Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 27.00 on volume (short entry).
- **Invalidation:** 29.63 (Close above the high of the supply bar)
---
### BE (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume Test/Rally Continuation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart indicates Stopping Volume, suggesting accumulation after a massive volume spike in November/December. The latest weekly bar is a wide spread down on high volume (RelVol 0.67), closing off the lows (CLV -0.21). This looks like a Test or natural reaction following the powerful SOS bar two weeks prior (CLV 0.88). The price is holding above the significant low of $128.45, confirming demand dominance in the short term, aligning with the BULLISH Quarterly Context.

**Key Levels:** 155.87 (Resistance), 137.76 (Immediate Support), 128.45 (Major Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Strong rebound above 145.00 on volume (long entry).
- **Invalidation:** 137.76 (Close below the low of the test bar)
---
### BEP (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Neutral/Supply Emergence

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart confirmed Supply Dominance. The last three weeks show indecision. The week of 1/5 was a wide spread down on high volume (RelVol 0.78), closing near the low (CLV -0.78), confirming supply. The following week reversed strongly (CLV 0.40). The last bar is a narrow spread up bar on lower volume (RelVol 0.52) with a neutral close (CLV 0.16). The market is fighting within a range, but the overall Quarterly trend is BEARISH.

**Key Levels:** 28.97 (Resistance), 27.48 (Immediate Support), 26.71 (Major Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 28.97 (long) or break below 27.48 (short).
- **Invalidation:** 28.97 (Close above range high)
---
### BHF (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Neutral/Weakness at Highs

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart indicates a Buying Climax. The last three weeks show low volume action (RelVol ~0.44-0.66) and narrow spreads, trading near the high of $65.36. The last bar is a narrow spread down bar closing near the low (CLV -0.44), suggesting minor profit-taking or supply. Given the BEARISH Quarterly context and Monthly Climax signal, this quiet supply suggests difficulty moving higher, but no immediate collapse.

**Key Levels:** 65.36 (Resistance), 63.96 (Immediate Support), 64.50 (Intermediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 63.96 on volume (short entry).
- **Invalidation:** 64.70 (Close above recent high)
---
### BKSY (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax Test/Weakness

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart flags a Buying Climax. The recent weekly bars show strong up movement, culminating in a wide spread up bar on average volume (RelVol 0.92) two weeks ago, with a low CLV (0.18), suggesting initial supply absorption. The last week is a wide spread up bar on quiet volume (RelVol 0.74), also closing neutrally (CLV 0.14). This suggests continued weakness near the high $29.79. The bullish movement lacks conviction.

**Key Levels:** 29.79 (Resistance/Climax), 23.90 (Immediate Support), 25.65 (Intermediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 23.90 on volume (short entry).
- **Invalidation:** 29.47 (Close above the high of the last two weeks)
---
### BNS (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Short-term Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence indicates Supply Dominance. The week of 1/5 was a wide spread down bar on high volume (RelVol 1.88), closing near the low (CLV -0.60), confirming supply. The last two weeks are low volume (RelVol 1.27, 0.74) up bars with positive CLV, suggesting a short-term test of supply is being performed. The test is currently succeeding as price is rising quietly. Given the BULLISH Quarterly Context, this could be a minor shakeout.

**Key Levels:** 74.98 (Resistance), 72.93 (Immediate Support/Test Level), 71.63 (Supply Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 74.98 on high volume (long entry).
- **Invalidation:** 72.93 (Close below the low of the test area)
---
### BP (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence confirmed Supply Dominance. The last two weeks show effort by demand failing to maintain momentum. Two weeks ago, volume was high (RelVol 1.38), but the close was neutral (CLV 0.18). The last bar is a strong up bar on lower volume (RelVol 0.81), closing near the high (CLV 0.78), but it failed to exceed the prior swing high of $36.29, suggesting limited demand interest after the massive supply bar on 1/5 (CLV -0.37, RelVol 1.85). Short-term supply is present.

**Key Levels:** 36.71 (Resistance), 35.03 (Immediate Support), 33.40 (Major Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 35.03 on volume (short entry).
- **Invalidation:** 36.71 (Close above the last high)
---
### BRBR (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Neutral/Demand Returning

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH, but the stock is showing signs of potential accumulation. The previous three weeks were dominated by supply (CLV -0.99, 0.26, 0.56). However, the last weekly bar is a wide spread up on high volume (RelVol 1.03), closing strongly (CLV 0.66). This is a strong rebound from the low, suggesting demand is returning and absorbing selling. This is a potential stopping volume effect, contrary to the Monthly Supply Dominance.

**Key Levels:** 28.26 (Immediate Resistance), 24.65 (Immediate Support), 21.67 (Major Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 28.26 on volume (long entry).
- **Invalidation:** 24.65 (Close below the low of the SOS bar)
---
### BRKR (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume Test/Rally Failure

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart flags Stopping Volume, but the short-term view is weak. The week of 1/12 was a high volume Selling Climax/Stopping Volume (RelVol 1.06, CLV -0.86). The next bar (last week) was an inside bar on quiet volume (RelVol 0.70), but it closed neutrally (CLV 0.05). The failure to rebound strongly after a high-volume climax suggests a weak reaction by demand. Given the BEARISH Quarterly Context, this failure to rally is concerning.

**Key Levels:** 53.50 (Immediate Resistance), 46.82 (Stopping Volume Low/Support), 56.22 (Distribution Peak)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 46.82 on volume (short entry).
- **Invalidation:** 53.50 (Close above the high of the reaction bar)
---
### BSY (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Indecision

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart flags Supply Dominance. The last two weekly bars show tight consolidation below $40 on quiet volume (RelVol 1.03, 0.82). The last bar is a wide spread up bar, closing neutrally (CLV 0.17). This indicates neither supply nor demand is dominant, keeping the market trapped in a tight range. Given the BEARISH Quarterly Context, low volume at resistance is generally unfavorable for bulls.

**Key Levels:** 40.66 (Resistance), 37.55 (Immediate Support), 38.64 (Intermediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 37.55 on volume (short entry) OR break above 40.66 on volume (long entry).
- **Invalidation:** 40.66 (Close above range high)
---
### BWIN (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Neutral

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart suggests Supply Dominance. The last weekly bar is a wide spread down bar on average volume (RelVol 0.91), closing near the low (CLV -0.75). This is strong evidence of professional selling emerging again after a failed rally attempt the previous week (CLV 0.68). The rally into $27.01 appears exhausted. Price is testing the lower end of the recent trading range.

**Key Levels:** 27.01 (Resistance), 24.89 (Immediate Support), 23.35 (Major Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 24.89 on volume (short entry).
- **Invalidation:** 26.81 (Close above the high of the last supply bar)
---
### BXSL (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart flags Supply Dominance. The week of 1/5 was a high volume bar (RelVol 1.03) with a wide spread up, yet closed neutrally (CLV 0.04), indicating supply absorption/Effort No Result. The next week was a low volume test (RelVol 0.83) that closed strongly (CLV 0.74). However, the last bar reverses this entirely: narrow spread down on quiet volume (RelVol 0.76), closing near the low (CLV -0.59). This suggests the prior weak buying climax is leading to selling confirmation, amplified by the BEARISH Quarterly Context.

**Key Levels:** 26.94 (Resistance), 25.90 (Immediate Support), 25.42 (Major Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 25.90 on volume (short entry).
- **Invalidation:** 26.94 (Close above the high of the recent range)
---
### CALM (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence confirmed Supply Dominance. The week of 1/5 was a major supply bar (RelVol 2.24, CLV -0.76). The following week bounced back strongly (CLV 0.97). The last bar is a wide spread up bar on lower volume (RelVol 1.17), closing strongly (CLV 0.35). This suggests a struggle for control. The price is challenging the supply area around $82.80, but the overall Quarterly trend remains BEARISH.

**Key Levels:** 82.80 (Resistance), 75.72 (Immediate Support), 71.92 (Major Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 82.80 on volume (long entry) OR failure to hold 78.00 (short entry).
- **Invalidation:** 75.72 (Close below the low of the SOS bar)
---
### CMPO (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Test/Absorption (Following Stopping Volume)

**Smart Money Logic:**
High volume Stopping Volume (01/05) established strong professional interest. The subsequent pullback/consolidation (01/19 & 01/26) occurred on decreasing volume, confirming that selling pressure has dried up temporarily (No Supply condition forming). This absorption phase favors continuation of the bullish quarterly trend.

**Key Levels:** 25.95 (Recent High/Resistance), 24.09 (Immediate Support), 18.38 (Major Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Weekly close above 25.95 with above average volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 24.09
---
### CORT (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Sign of Strength (SOS) / Accumulation

**Smart Money Logic:**
Despite the bearish quarterly trend, extreme high volume selling (12/29) marked a potential major accumulation climax (Stopping Volume) at 32.99. The subsequent massive wide spread up bar on 01/19 (RelVol 1.92) is a strong Sign of Strength, indicating aggressive absorption and a potential reversal into Phase D of accumulation. Requires confirmation via a successful test.

**Key Levels:** 44.84 (Immediate Resistance), 37.50 (Anticipated Test Area), 32.99 (Major Accumulation Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Successful low volume test of 37.50, then break above 44.84.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 34.54
---
### CPNG (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Confirmed Weakness

**Smart Money Logic:**
The volume profile (RelVol > 2.0 on 01/12) coupled with a wide down spread and weak close confirms institutional selling (Supply Dominance). The trend continuation on 01/19, closing near lows, validates ongoing bearish pressure in line with the quarterly trend. No sign of stopping volume or professional buying yet.

**Key Levels:** 23.65 (Resistance), 19.69 (Key Support), 20.78 (Current Area)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 19.69 with increased volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 21.50
---
### CRBG (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result Up (Distribution)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Despite two weeks of relatively high volume (01/12, 01/19), the price action shows narrow movement and weak closes (CLV near zero). This suggests professional selling pressure is absorbing demand around the 30.00-31.50 range, consistent with the Monthly Buying Climax signal and the quarterly bearish trend.

**Key Levels:** 31.50 (Resistance), 29.80 (Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 29.80 on high volume (Short trigger).
- **Invalidation:** Close above 31.50
---
### CSGP (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result Up / Accumulation Cycle

**Smart Money Logic:**
The extreme volume and volatility (01/05 Selling Climax followed by 01/12 Sign of Strength) indicate a major shift/base formation. The latest bar (01/19) shows supply reappearing (high volume, poor CLV), suggesting this area is still under contention. Smart Money is consolidating, requiring more absorption/testing.

**Key Levels:** 67.79 (Resistance), 62.81 (Immediate Support), 57.01 (Accumulation Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Low volume test near 62.81 or breakout above 67.80 with volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 62.810
---
### CTRA (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (BC) - Confirmed Early

**Smart Money Logic:**
The bar on 01/12 displayed extreme volume and wide spread up, yet closed poorly (CLV -0.457), signaling a Buying Climax where Smart Money distributed shares into rising enthusiasm. This is a warning sign of an impending correction or Distribution phase, despite the overall bullish quarterly trend.

**Key Levels:** 28.48 (Climax High), 26.00 (Key Support), 24.68 (Major Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close below 26.00 with confirmation of supply.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 28.48
---
### DOW (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result Up (Potential Distribution)

**Smart Money Logic:**
While the quarterly trend is bullish, the move towards 28.52 hit resistance, evidenced by the high volume, poor CLV bar on 01/12 (Effort No Result). This suggests Smart Money may be distributing in this range, consistent with the Monthly Supply Dominance signal. Price needs to consolidate or show a clear test.

**Key Levels:** 29.09 (Resistance), 26.30 (Key Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for breakout confirmation above 29.10 or reversal below 26.30.
- **Invalidation:** Range-bound; requires clear trigger.
---
### DUOL (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume/Reaction Rally

**Smart Money Logic:**
Extreme high volume selling on 01/12 confirmed Supply Dominance and a potential selling climax at 147.70. The following week showed a strong, wide-spread reaction rally (CLV 0.446), indicating professional buying entered the market. This is likely Phase A or B of accumulation, but the bearish quarterly trend dictates monitoring for a successful test of the lows.

**Key Levels:** 161.28 (Resistance), 147.70 (SV Low/Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Successful low volume test near 147.70.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 147.00
---
### ENR (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Weakness / Supply Reappearance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The strong bar on 01/05 was immediately followed by two weeks of decline, closing poorly near lows on average volume. This sequence (Strength -> Weakness) suggests supply entered the market (distribution/profit-taking) near 21.90, leading to a likely short-term correction toward major support.

**Key Levels:** 21.90 (Resistance), 19.63 (Immediate Support), 18.92 (Major Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 19.63 with confirmation.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 21.00
---
### FER (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Strength Confirmation / Consolidation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The price established good strength (01/12), but the latest bar shows slightly lower volume and a moderate close (CLV 0.284), indicating temporary demand slowdown or absorption near the recent high of 68.54. Given the bullish quarterly trend, this is a pause, but the monthly supply signal requires careful monitoring of the 68.54 resistance.

**Key Levels:** 68.54 (Resistance), 66.61 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 68.54 with volume confirmation.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 66.61
---
### GNTX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result Up / Supply Reappearance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The high volume on 01/12 coupled with a flat/weak close signals Effort No Result, suggesting supply entered near 24.53. This weakness was followed up by a down bar on 01/19, indicating Smart Money is distributing or allowing a pullback toward lower support levels.

**Key Levels:** 24.79 (Resistance), 23.34 (Key Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 23.34 with volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 24.53
---
### GWRE (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Sign of Strength (SOS)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The volatile drop on 01/12 was met with extreme institutional buying, which confirmed on 01/19 with a high volume, wide UP spread, and strong close (SOS/Stopping Volume). This suggests a potential major reversal and accumulation phase against the quarterly bearish trend. The 158.80 area is now major support.

**Key Levels:** 187.54 (Resistance), 160.85 (Immediate Support), 158.80 (SV Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Successful low volume test near 160.85, then break above 187.54.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 158.80
---
### HDB (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Deceleration of Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
The market underwent strong Supply Dominance on 01/05. While volume remained high on 01/19 (RelVol 1.274), the price action narrowed and closed away from the low (CLV 0.090), suggesting institutional supply is stalling or Smart Money is absorbing in the 31.34 area. Accumulation is likely beginning.

**Key Levels:** 32.66 (Resistance), 31.34 (SV Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Weekly close above 32.66.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 31.34
---
### HPE (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Reaction Rally

**Smart Money Logic:**
The price dropped into the monthly Stopping Volume level (20.07) on 01/19 and immediately saw a wide-spread rebound on average volume, confirming institutional support. This suggests the market is starting Phase B of accumulation, attempting to reverse the quarterly bearish trend.

**Key Levels:** 21.93 (Resistance), 21.44 (Immediate Support), 20.07 (SV Low)

### HRMY (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Weakness / No Demand Rally

**Smart Money Logic:**
Institutional selling aggressively drove the price down on 01/12 (Weakness signal). The subsequent rally on 01/19 lacked volume support (No Demand, RelVol 0.581), indicating that professional demand is absent and the move higher is likely a short-covering bounce before the price tests lower support levels near 35.16.

**Key Levels:** 39.40 (Resistance), 36.22 (Immediate Support), 35.16 (Major Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 36.22 with confirming volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 38.00
---
### KDP (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Test/Absorption (Consolidation)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The price is in a tight range, with a sharp downside move (01/12) immediately countered by a strong rally (01/19). This action suggests institutional absorption is taking place near the 27.32 support level, preparing for a potential move higher in line with the bullish quarterly trend. Demand is active at the lower end of the range.

**Key Levels:** 28.36 (Resistance), 27.32 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and hold above 28.36.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 27.32
---
### KVYO (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Reaction Rally

**Smart Money Logic:**
The price action suggests a powerful shakeout concluded near 23.00 on 01/12. The immediate wide-spread, high volume rally on 01/19 confirms professional buying (Stopping Volume action). This signals the start of an accumulation phase, attempting to reverse the quarterly bearish trend.

**Key Levels:** 26.73 (Resistance), 23.74 (Immediate Support), 23.00 (Major SV Low)

#### Action Plan

---
### LQDA (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result Up / Consolidation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The rally attempt on 01/12 resulted in an Effort No Result bar, indicating supply absorption near 41.57. The subsequent bullish bar (01/19) was on lower volume and failed to reclaim strength, suggesting consolidation or distribution against the overall bullish trend, especially considering the Monthly Supply Dominance flag.

**Key Levels:** 42.46 (Resistance), 37.67 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 42.46 with volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 37.67
---
### MAN (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Weakness / No Demand Bounce

**Smart Money Logic:**
The reversal bar on 01/12 confirmed supply entering the market near 31.61. The subsequent rally attempt on 01/19 was on lower volume and failed to achieve a strong close (No Demand). This sequence confirms that supply is overcoming demand, preparing for a markdown, consistent with the Monthly Supply Dominance flag.

**Key Levels:** 31.61 (Resistance), 29.40 (Immediate Support), 28.83 (Major Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 29.40 with volume.

### MSFU (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Sign of Strength

**Smart Money Logic:**
The price action suggests a powerful reversal after the shakeout on 01/12. The massive volume, wide spread up bar on 01/19, closing strongly, confirms institutional accumulation (Stopping Volume). This is a strong signal for a potential reversal into a mark-up phase.

**Key Levels:** 38.92 (Resistance), 36.67 (Immediate Support), 33.85 (SV Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and hold above 38.92.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 36.67
---
### NFXL (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax (Stopping Volume)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The extremely high volume bar on 01/19 signals a Selling Climax, where institutional buying absorbed massive supply near 23.15. Despite closing poorly relative to the open, the volume spike combined with the widest spread indicates a change of character and potential bottoming process, consistent with the weekly Stopping Volume alert.

**Key Levels:** 27.96 (Resistance), 23.15 (Major SV Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 27.96 with volume confirmation, or successful low-volume test.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 23.15
---
### OC (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result Up (Slowing Strength)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Following a strong SOS on 01/05, the subsequent weeks show increasing difficulty in sustaining momentum. The bar on 01/19 has a wide spread but low volume and a weak close (CLV 0.278), indicating Demand Exhaustion or institutional profit-taking near 126.92. Consolidation is likely.

**Key Levels:** 126.92 (Resistance), 122.02 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 126.92 with confirmation.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 122.02
---
### ONB (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result Up

**Smart Money Logic:**
The wide spread up bar on 01/19 failed to close strongly (CLV -0.298), indicating significant supply entered the market (Effort No Result) near 24.78. This suggests the mark-up phase is pausing or encountering distribution, aligning with the strong Monthly Supply Dominance signal.

**Key Levels:** 24.78 (Resistance), 23.26 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 24.78 with volume confirmation.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 23.26
---
### PSN (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result Up / Demand Exhaustion

**Smart Money Logic:**
Following a strong rally (SOS), the bar on 01/19 showed significant distribution signals: low volume on a wide up spread, resulting in a flat close (CLV 0.023). This confirms institutional supply is absorbing demand (Effort No Result), likely halting the upward move and setting up for consolidation or a markdown, consistent with the Monthly Supply Dominance.

**Key Levels:** 74.63 (Resistance), 70.74 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 70.74 with volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 74.63
---
### PTGX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result Up / No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
Following the strong weakness shown on 01/05, subsequent rallies (01/12 and 01/19) were met with resistance and lacked bullish follow-through (poor CLV, low volume). This confirms institutional supply is preventing a significant reversal, favoring continuation of the bearish quarterly trend.

**Key Levels:** 87.53 (Resistance), 79.87 (Immediate Support), 78.75 (Major Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 79.87 with volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 85.50
---
### QTWO (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Reversed Effort to Rise

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar (2026-01-19) shows a wide spread UP bar closing near the high (CLV 0.957) on high volume (RelVol 0.598). This is a strong sign of demand overcoming previous supply. The price is lifting off recent lows (63.43) after a significant monthly supply bar (Dec 2025). The bounce suggests accumulation, especially after the prior week's down bar closing near the low on high spread/volume, indicating potential exhaustion of sellers (Selling Climax characteristics, though not strictly classified as such). The current move up is an initial strong sign of smart money buying interest.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 70.24 (Previous weekly high), Support: 63.44 (Recent low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and hold above 70.00 on increasing bullish volume.
- **Invalidation:** Below 63.40 (Weekly low)
---
### RARE (NEUTRAL/BULLISH Watch)
**VSA Status:** Supply Absorption/Test in Zone

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly context is SUPPLY_DOMINANCE, but the weekly sequence shows significant volatility following a potential Selling Climax (2025-12-29 wide up bar on extreme volume). The last weekly bar (2026-01-19) is an UP bar closing near the high (CLV 0.747) on slightly above average volume (RelVol 1.13). This confirms short-term demand is present. The recent price action (last 4 weeks) is basing between 22 and 25, suggesting absorption of the massive volume from the 12/29 week.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 25.10 (Recent consolidation high), Support: 22.00 (Consolidation low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Sustained break and close above 25.10 (Potential Sign of Strength).
- **Invalidation:** Below 21.90 (Break of short-term base)
---
### RGTI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax Follow-Through

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly context suggests a BUYING_CLIMAX WATCH. The last weekly bar (01/19) is a wide spread DOWN bar, closing near the low (CLV -0.49) on high volume (RelVol 0.50). This confirms weakness after an earlier rally attempt failed (01/12 bar closed off its high). The market is failing to hold high prices, suggesting professional supply is dominating, selling into strength (distribution). The overall quarterly trend is BEARISH, reinforcing the supply pressure.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 26.50 (Recent high), Support: 22.41 (Recent consolidation low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and sustained close below 22.40 on follow-through volume.
- **Invalidation:** Above 24.80 (Above prior resistance failure)
---
### RKT (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result Down

**Smart Money Logic:**
Following a large bullish move (01/05 week, wide up bar, high volume), the last two weeks indicate supply. The 01/12 bar closed off the high on high volume (CLV -0.157). The latest bar (01/19) is a down bar closing near the low (CLV -0.496) on high volume (RelVol 0.644). This is a clear Effort No Result to the downside, implying smart money is selling into the rally, confirming the monthly SUPPLY_DOMINANCE watch status. This looks like a minor shakeout/distribution phase following the Sign of Strength.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 23.41 (Consolidation high), Support: 20.53 (Latest weekly low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below 20.50.
- **Invalidation:** Above 23.50 (Above recent distribution area)
---
### RVMD (NEUTRAL/BEARISH Watch)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result Down (Testing Area)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Following a massive Sign of Strength (01/05 week, extreme volume, CLV 0.868), the last two weeks are concerning. The 01/12 bar was a reversal, closing slightly off the high (CLV 0.24). The 01/19 bar is an Effort No Result down, a wide spread bar that failed to close strongly (CLV 0.100), despite the high volume (RelVol 1.06). This indicates that the rally is being met with significant supply (distribution/test of supply). The monthly CLV is negative, supporting the distribution thesis.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 124.49 (Recent high), Support: 113.33 (Prior weekly low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below 113.30, confirming supply control.
- **Invalidation:** Above 124.50 (Breakout continuation)
---
### SPOT (NEUTRAL/BULLISH Watch)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax/Reversal Attempt

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BEARISH, reflected in recent supply dominance (01/05 and 01/12 wide down bars on high volume, indicating panic selling). The latest bar (01/19) is a reversal attempt: an UP bar closing strong (CLV 0.706) on high volume (RelVol 1.31). This may be Stopping Volume/Selling Climax behavior, especially after a sharp drop. Smart Money may be initiating accumulation. Confirmation of demand is needed.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 548.55 (Prior weekly high), Support: 491.30 (Selling Climax low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Test down to 500-505 zone on low volume (No Supply) or break above 517.00.
- **Invalidation:** Below 491.00 (Continuation of bearish trend)
---
### TRU (NEUTRAL/BULLISH Watch)
**VSA Status:** Indecision/No Supply (Testing)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly context is strong (STOPPING_VOLUME CONFIRMED_STRONG), suggesting accumulation is underway. The last weekly bar (01/19) is a down bar but on below-average volume (RelVol 0.59) and a relatively narrow spread compared to prior weeks. The close is near the middle (CLV -0.045). This suggests a potential 'Test for Supply' after the strong reversal in the prior two weeks. Smart Money might be pausing before initiating the mark-up phase in line with the bullish quarterly trend.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 86.95 (Prior weekly high), Support: 81.71 (Recent low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close above 86.95 with increasing volume, or a clear UP bar on low volume next week.
- **Invalidation:** Below 81.70 (Failure of accumulation base)
---
### WGMI (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Absorption/Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly context is BULLISH. The monthly is currently in a BUYING_CLIMAX watch, suggesting distribution/shakeout is possible. However, the latest weekly bar (01/19) is an UP bar closing near the high (CLV 0.376) on below-average volume (RelVol 0.86). This suggests demand is present, and the prior week's high volume move up (01/12) is being digested successfully. This looks like a quiet test of supply after the strong prior movement.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 51.78 (Recent high), Support: 45.11 (Latest low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close above 51.80 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** Below 45.00 (Break of consolidation low)

## Other
### ABT (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar shows an extremely wide spread down bar on extraordinarily high volume (RelVol 2.57). This is a clear sign of professional selling (Effort) that resulted in a close near the low, confirming weakness (No Result for buyers). The price crashed from ~$121 to ~$107. The Quarterly context is BEARISH, amplifying this signal. Monthly data confirms a sharp January sell-off with high volume and a deep CLV of -0.74.

**Key Levels:** 120.93 (Prior Low/Support), 105.78 (New Low/Initial Support), 125.76 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Failure to breach 110.00 on any pullback (short entry).
- **Invalidation:** 121.15 (Close above the prior week's close)
---
### AEO (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax/Demand Failure

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart shows a Buying Climax. The last weekly bar closed near the absolute low (CLV -0.95) on average volume (RelVol 0.68), representing a strong down move immediately after testing the prior high resistance ~$26.70. This signifies a failed attempt by buyers to continue the rally and confirms the presence of supply. The January Monthly CLV is extremely bearish (-0.96).

**Key Levels:** 26.69 (Immediate Resistance), 24.08 (Immediate Support), 23.88 (Monthly Low/Major Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 24.08 on volume (short entry).
- **Invalidation:** 26.70 (Close above the high of the last supply bar)
---
### AEVA (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result (Supply)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart shows a Buying Climax after a massive volume spike in January. The last weekly bar is a wide spread down, closing near the absolute low (CLV -0.98), despite average volume (RelVol 1.23). This is clear Supply Dominance. The rally into $22.62 appears exhausted, and professional selling is overwhelming demand. The weekly sequence has CONFIRMED the SUPPLY_DOMINANCE status.

**Key Levels:** 22.62 (Resistance/Climax Peak), 15.76 (Immediate Support), 12.30 (Major Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Pullback to 17.50 without strong follow-through or break below 15.76 (short entry).
