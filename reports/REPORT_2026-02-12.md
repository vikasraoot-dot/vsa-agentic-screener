### RGTI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Failure)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Very low conviction in the recent bounce. Monthly chart shows a buying climax being followed by heavy selling. Lack of professional volume on rallies.

**Key Levels:** 14.83 (Support), 18.38 (Resistance), 17.63 (Pivot)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 15.75
- **Invalidation:** 18.40
---
### RKT (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
Volume is non-existent on the weekly rally attempts. Professional money is not participating, and monthly supply dominance remains the primary factor.

**Key Levels:** 17.05 (Support), 20.30 (Resistance), 18.25 (Pivot)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 18.20
- **Invalidation:** 20.35
---
### RVMD (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Failure)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Monthly buying climax detection. The weekly bounce is on extremely low volume (0.38 RelVol), indicating a dead cat bounce with no real institutional buying.

**Key Levels:** 93.02 (Support), 101.93 (Resistance), 113.33 (Pivot)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Loss of 93.70
- **Invalidation:** 99.60
---
### RYAAY (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Very weak CLV (-0.86) on the latest bar with declining price. Stopping volume detected earlier was failed, and supply has re-taken control of the market.

**Key Levels:** 64.64 (Support), 70.71 (Resistance), 72.56 (Supply)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 64.60
- **Invalidation:** 70.75
---
### RYN (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Price is unable to sustain any rally. High volume selling in Jan (RelVol 3.7) has left an overhang of supply. Latest weekly bars show a negative CLV and weak closes.

**Key Levels:** 22.04 (Support), 22.98 (Resistance), 24.01 (Major Supply)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 22.00
- **Invalidation:** 23.00
---
### SA (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
The recent up-move on the weekly timeframe occurred on extremely low relative volume (0.39), suggesting a lack of professional participation. Combined with monthly Supply Dominance, this looks like a weak rally intended to trap late buyers.

**Key Levels:** 34.41, 30.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 30.65
- **Invalidation:** 34.50
---
### SATS (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Following a monthly Buying Climax, the weekly chart shows heavy supply on Jan 26. The recent low-volume bars indicate a lack of buying support rather than a successful test.

**Key Levels:** 132.25, 106.60

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 106.60
- **Invalidation:** 118.00
---
### SONY (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
Consistent supply dominance and a bearish quarterly trend. The recent rally to 22.95 occurred on low relative volume, indicating smart money is not supporting higher prices.

**Key Levels:** 21.18, 23.22

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Failure to hold 22.00
- **Invalidation:** 23.25
---
### SPOT (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
Extremely high volatility with a massive shakeout bar on Feb 02. The recovery on Feb 09 shows high volume absorption, but the spread remains too wide for a safe entry.

**Key Levels:** 405.00, 504.50

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Successful low-volume test of 420.00
- **Invalidation:** 405.00
---
### SSNC (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Overcoming Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
Large effort to push down on Feb 02 with very high volume. The follow-through on Feb 09 shows the market is still weak despite early signals of stopping volume.

**Key Levels:** 70.89, 81.50

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 70.89
- **Invalidation:** 77.50
---
### SYF (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Heavy selling volume throughout January. While volume has slightly decreased, the price action remains heavy with no significant demand bars or tests visible.

**Key Levels:** 71.56, 75.82

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 71.50
- **Invalidation:** 76.00
---
### TROW (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort vs Result (Bearish)

**Smart Money Logic:**
A major breakdown on Feb 02 with high volume confirms professional selling. The subsequent low-volume churn at the lows suggests a lack of buying power.

**Key Levels:** 91.70, 103.60

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 91.70
- **Invalidation:** 98.00
---
### TRU (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Potential No Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
A large sell-off followed by a very narrow spread bar on lower volume. This could be 'No Supply', but the bearish quarterly context requires a strong confirmation bar.

**Key Levels:** 65.23, 75.70

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wide spread up-bar closing above 76.00
- **Invalidation:** 65.00
---
### UBER (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Clear downward sequence on high relative volume. The latest bar shows a very low CLV (-0.83), indicating that sellers remain in control and no support has formed.

**Key Levels:** 70.65, 80.05

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 70.65
- **Invalidation:** 75.00
---
### UGI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Upthrust

**Smart Money Logic:**
A classic trap: high volume breakout in late January was immediately met with heavy supply (Upthrust) on Feb 02. Current volume is low, signifying No Demand.

**Key Levels:** 36.57, 41.34

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 36.57
- **Invalidation:** 39.00
---
### UNH (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
Following a significant breakdown, the price is retracing on low volume. Professional money is not participating in this bounce, likely leading to further downside.

**Key Levels:** 266.29, 286.93

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 269.80
- **Invalidation:** 281.00
---
### USIG (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Low Activity

**Smart Money Logic:**
The ticker shows extremely narrow spreads and low volume fluctuations. Typical of an income fund with no distinct professional accumulation or distribution signs currently.

**Key Levels:** 51.43, 52.10

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** None
- **Invalidation:** 51.40
---
### VONG (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

Steady distribution evidenced by falling prices on decent relative volume. No stopping volume or significant demand bars are present in the recent history.

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 117.00
- **Invalidation:** 119.50
---
### WGMI (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** No Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
After heavy selling in late January, volume has dried up completely (RelVol 0.34). This indicates supply is gone, but we are awaiting demand to step in.

**Key Levels:** 34.99, 45.06

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wide spread up-bar on high volume
- **Invalidation:** 34.99
---
### WPM (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** No Demand Rally

**Smart Money Logic:**
Massive volatility with a huge up-bar on Feb 09, but it occurred on lower relative volume. This suggests the move may be a reaction rather than sustained professional buying.

**Key Levels:** 130.33, 160.36

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Successful test of 140.00 on low volume
- **Invalidation:** 130.00
---
### Z (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Aggressive selling with increasing relative volume (2.09). Sellers are clearly in control, and price is closing consistently at the bottom of the range.

**Key Levels:** 44.02, 62.66

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 44.00
- **Invalidation:** 54.00
---
### ZM (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Effort No Result

**Smart Money Logic:**
Very high volume on Jan 26 failed to push the price significantly higher, and the subsequent bars are churning. This indicates smart money is selling into the retail demand.

**Key Levels:** 79.77, 97.58

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 88.60
- **Invalidation:** 96.50
