## 🚀 Ready for Entry
### ACLX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Pseudo Market Top

**Smart Money Logic:**
Massive effort for no result. Relative volume exploded to 9.63x, yet the price spread was extremely narrow (0.63) with a negative CLV. This indicates professional distribution where huge sell orders are meeting retail buy orders at the high.

**Key Levels:** 114.26, 113.62, 71.25

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 113.60
- **Invalidation:** 114.50
---
### ACN (BULLISH)

**Key Levels:** 188.73, 208.72, 224.22

#### Action Plan

- **Invalidation:** 82.00
---

- **Invalidation:** 312.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 448.00
- **Invalidation:** 366.00

- **Invalidation:** 26.80
---
### BCE (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Professional Buying on Dip

Despite the 'Supply Dominance' algo status, the last week showed a strong recovery (CLV 0.79) on decent volume. The move lower in early Feb was likely a 'Shakeout' to clear weak hands before higher prices.

**Key Levels:** 26.49 (Resistance), 24.97 (Support)

- **Entry Trigger:** Move above 26.40
- **Invalidation:** 25.50
---
### BEP (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply on Pullback

**VSA Status:** Upthrust / Supply Entering

### BHP (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

- **Entry Trigger:** Successful test of 57.50 with low volume
- **Invalidation:** 57.00

- **Entry Trigger:** Break of 21.30
- **Invalidation:** 23.46

### EXPE (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
After a significant Bearish Trend, the most recent week shows a strong recovery in Close-to-Low Value (CLV 0.83) on high relative volume. This indicates professionals are beginning to absorb supply at lower levels, though a successful test is needed for a bullish reversal.

**Key Levels:** 185.34, 215.69, 236.85

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A successful test of the 185 support level on low volume or a break above 221 with high volume.

---
### FER (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly context is bullish and price is trending higher. However, weekly volume is significantly lower than average (RelVol 0.71), suggesting the current move lacks professional conviction or is a 'drift' higher. Monthly strength remains the anchor.

- **Invalidation:** 71.00

### FFIV (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Test in a Consolidation

**Smart Money Logic:**
Price is moving sideways with declining volume (RelVol 0.76). This indicates a lack of supply but also a lack of aggressive demand. The stopping volume on the monthly chart suggests long-term support is building.

**Key Levels:** 266.08, 278.39, 285.00

- **Invalidation:** 265.00

---
### FIGR (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
Extreme panic selling visible in the RelVol of 2.25 with a close near the lows. While this volume spike often precedes a bounce (Climax), the lack of support structure makes it too dangerous for bulls.

- **Invalidation:** 24.50

- **Invalidation:** 115.00

- **Invalidation:** 8.00

---
### KLAR (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax

### OMF (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Significant supply is present as evidenced by the high relative volume on downward moves. The wide spreads on the monthly and weekly charts, combined with closes near the lows (CLV -0.35 to -0.81), indicate that smart money is liquidating and there is little aggressive buying to support the price.

**Key Levels:** 53.59, 58.02, 65.34

**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly chart shows a Buying Climax with extremely high CLV (0.99) but at the end of an extended move. Weekly volume is tapering off as price grinds higher, suggesting a lack of professional follow-through and a potential 'upthrust' scenario.

### PB (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

### PHG (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

- **Entry Trigger:** Low volume test of the 29.50 level.
- **Invalidation:** 28.40
---
### PLTU (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Extreme downward momentum on high relative volume. Although the most recent week showed a recovery close (CLV 0.83), the overall monthly context is heavily skewed toward supply. Likely a 'dead cat bounce'.

### RYAAY (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

Significant volume into the lows (RelVol 1.84 monthly) followed by a recovery close. Last week's volume was high but the close was neutral-to-strong, indicating absorption of selling pressure.

**Key Levels:** 21.13, 25.07, 27.07

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Low volume test of 23.50 or break of 26.20.
- **Invalidation:** 21.13

### WGMI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Volume increases on down moves and rallies occur on decreasing volume ('No Demand'). The monthly sequence remains bearish despite the stabilization in price.

**Key Levels:** 34.99, 39.88, 46.62

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Rejection at 41.50.
- **Invalidation:** 44.17
---
### WHR (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort to Fall

**Smart Money Logic:**
Massive increase in volume (RelVol 3.8) on a very wide spread down bar. Closing near the low (CLV -0.82) confirms that supply is overwhelming demand and professional money is aggressively selling or shorting the breakdown.

**Key Levels:** 84.49, 66.85, 68.43

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 66.85 or weak rally to 75.00 with low volume
- **Invalidation:** 85.84
---
### WRB (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** No Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stock is drifting upwards on very low relative volume (0.60). While the trend is bullish, the lack of effort (volume) suggests a lack of professional participation. This is often a 'No Supply' test, but requires a demand spike to confirm.

**Key Levels:** 69.95, 73.07, 67.25

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** High volume wide spread up-bar exceeding 73.07
- **Invalidation:** 68.45
---
### WTRG (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
Extreme volume (RelVol 3.58) on the most recent week with price failing to close near the high (CLV 0.18). This suggests 'Effort No Result' where supply is being unloaded into a retail buying surge.

**Key Levels:** 40.87, 38.65, 37.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Failure to hold 39.00 or break below 38.65
- **Invalidation:** 40.87
---
### XYL (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Weak Rally

**Smart Money Logic:**
A major high-volume down move on Feb 9th (RelVol 2.46) has not been corrected. The subsequent two weeks show low-spread, low-effort movement, indicating a lack of buying interest following the supply dump.

**Key Levels:** 123.56, 131.95, 142.49

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 126.42
- **Invalidation:** 132.00
---
### Z (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
Massive volume at the lows (RelVol 2.95 and 1.94) followed by narrowing spreads suggests professional 'Bottom Fishing' or absorption. However, the price has not yet shown a 'Sign of Strength' (SOS) to confirm a reversal.

**Key Levels:** 41.91, 47.31, 54.97

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Successful test of 42.00 on very low volume or break above 47.31
- **Invalidation:** 41.90
---
### ZM (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort to Fall

**Smart Money Logic:**
Total collapse in price on extremely high volume (RelVol 2.59) and a very poor close. This is a clear 'Sign of Weakness' (SOW). Professional money is exiting, and there is no evidence of stopping volume yet.

**Key Levels:** 72.69, 90.54, 96.52

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short on weak rally to 80.00 or break of 72.00
- **Invalidation:** 90.54
