## 🚀 Ready for Entry
### ABVX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Severe Reversal

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly chart is categorized as a CONFIRMED_EARLY Buying Climax. After three weeks of massive spreads and high volume, the last two weeks show extreme weakness. The latest weekly bar (RelVol 0.73, Spread 14.02) closes near the absolute low (CLV -0.975), indicating relentless supply following the peak. This confirms the initial climax absorption has failed, and a significant markdown phase is likely initiating from the quarterly BEARISH_TREND context.

**Key Levels:** Major Resistance: 125.00 (Last week's high), Immediate Support: 108.95 (Prior low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and hold below the prior swing low (108.95).
- **Invalidation:** 125.00 (A move back into the climax high area would negate the markdown setup)
---
### ACWX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Reversal

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the weekly sequence shows a BUYING_CLIMAX (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The last five weekly bars show shrinking spreads and progressively higher volume, classic signs of distribution near a peak. The last bar printed high volume (RelVol 2.22) with a wide spread, but closed near the low (CLV -0.684). This confirms sellers aggressively stepped in at the high (72.33). The high volume suggests heavy supply overcoming demand.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 72.33, Support: 70.49

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and hold below 70.49 on strong volume.
- **Invalidation:** 72.33 (If the high is exceeded, the climax is negated)
---
### ADP (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Heavy Selling

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BEARISH. The last weekly bar is a wide spread down bar, closing near the low (CLV -0.62) on ultra-high volume (RelVol 1.84). This is classic Supply Dominance, indicating strong selling pressure. This action also confirms the monthly bar's negative CLV (-0.742) and high volume. Smart Money is aggressively selling this relief rally attempt.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 260.24, Immediate Support: 243.68

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and hold below 243.68 (low of the decisive supply bar).
- **Invalidation:** 252.69 (If the price recovers the open of the last major supply bar)
---
### AEM (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Climactic Selling

**Smart Money Logic:**
Despite a BULLISH quarterly trend, the last weekly bar is extremely bearish. It features an ultra-wide spread (36.48) and ultra-high volume (RelVol 2.03), closing near the low (CLV -0.89). This represents climactic selling/supply dominance, wiping out all gains from the previous weeks. This aggressive markdown signals a major short-term shift, likely driven by significant institutional unloading, potentially setting up a major correction or trading range.

**Key Levels:** Major Resistance: 225.00, Immediate Support: 188.52

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on break and hold below 188.52, or on a low-volume retest of 200-205.
- **Invalidation:** 215.95 (Recovery above previous high invalidates the supply absorption thesis)
---
### AEO (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Effort No Result Down

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the monthly is marked by a WATCH_FOR_TEST Buying Climax (-0.84 CLV on the monthly chart). The last two weekly bars are definitively bearish: wide spread down, high volume, and closing near the lows (CLV -0.95 and -0.42). The final bar has high volume (RelVol 0.85) but a narrow spread, still closing poorly. This is clear supply overcoming demand, confirming the distribution hinted at in the monthly chart.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 24.36, Support: 22.89

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and hold below 22.89.
- **Invalidation:** 26.70 (Price recovery above the peak of the latest aggressive selling wave)
---
### AEVA (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Sharp Reversal

**Smart Money Logic:**
A classic blow-off top scenario is evident here (RelVol 3.54, Spread 8.75 in the second week). The subsequent weeks show rapid distribution, culminating in the last bar which is a wide spread down, closing near the low (CLV -0.836) on high volume (RelVol 1.36). This high volume selling pressure confirms the SUPPLY_DOMINANCE signal and the massive absorption of demand. The quarterly trend may be bullish, but this stock is entering a severe markdown phase.

**Key Levels:** Major Resistance: 22.62, Immediate Support: 12.50

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on a break below 12.50.
- **Invalidation:** 15.81 (Recovery above the open of the last supply bar)
---
### AGI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Climactic Selling

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly context is BEARISH, despite recent relief rallies. The last weekly bar is a significant warning sign: ultra-high volume (RelVol 2.23) and a wide spread down, closing near the low (CLV -0.835). This is textbook Supply Dominance, indicating large-scale selling and a likely climax to the downside movement, confirming the prior weekly bar's low volume rally (Effort No Result Up). The rally attempt failed, and the markdown is continuing aggressively.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 44.39 (Last open), Support: 36.16

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a low-volume retest failure (No Demand) near 38.00, or confirmed break below 36.16.
- **Invalidation:** 45.18 (If price recovers and exceeds the high of the supply bar)
---
### AIQ (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Effort No Result Up

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the monthly shows a BUYING_CLIMAX WATCH_FOR_TEST. The last weekly bar is high volume (RelVol 0.84) with a wide spread, but it closed near the low (CLV -0.803), reversing sharply from the high (53.93). This is a strong Effort No Result Up, confirming institutional distribution/supply at the highs. This suggests the climax identified on the monthly chart is playing out.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Resistance: 53.94, Support: 51.75

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and hold below 51.75.
- **Invalidation:** 53.94 (The high of the supply bar)
---
### AMBA (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Markdown Continuation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH. The last weekly bar is a wide spread down, closing near the low (CLV -0.678) on moderate volume (RelVol 0.89). This confirms continued supply pressure, consistent with the SUPPLY_DOMINANCE signal. The high volume bars two and three weeks ago (Stopping Volume attempts) failed, and the price is now moving lower. Smart Money is actively selling, pushing the price towards the lows set earlier in the month (63.08).

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 69.05, Immediate Support: 63.08

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and hold below 63.08 on increased volume.
- **Invalidation:** 69.25 (If the price recovers the prior high of the failure bar)
---
### AMKR (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Climax Reversal

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the monthly chart shows a BUYING_CLIMAX WATCH_FOR_TEST. The last weekly bar is a wide spread down bar, closing near the low (CLV -0.773) on moderate volume (RelVol 1.04). This confirms the presence of aggressive supply, likely distributing shares near the highs (55.17-54.20). The strong rejection from the high suggests the buying climax is confirmed and a markdown phase is underway.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 52.56, Immediate Support: 47.79

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and hold below 47.79 on strong volume.
- **Invalidation:** 55.17 (If price recovers the climax high)
---
### APH (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Climactic Selling

**Smart Money Logic:**
Despite a BULLISH quarterly trend, the last weekly bar shows climactic selling. It features ultra-high volume (RelVol 2.49) and a massive spread (27.04), closing poorly near the low (CLV -0.698). This is significant Supply Dominance, indicating large-scale institutional distribution after a multi-week rally attempt (weeks 2 and 3). This is likely a sharp reversal initiating a markdown or a wide distribution range.

**Key Levels:** Major Resistance: 167.04, Immediate Support: 140.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on a confirmed break below 140.00.
- **Invalidation:** 157.54 (Recovery above the prior week's high)
---
### ARES (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Markdown

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH, and the monthly chart shows a BUYING_CLIMAX WATCH_FOR_TEST, likely indicating distribution. The last two weekly bars are definitively bearish. The prior week had a massive spread down (14.48) closing near the low (CLV -0.979). The latest bar confirms weakness with ultra-high volume (RelVol 1.37) and a wide spread down, closing in the bottom half (CLV -0.126). This confirms aggressive supply and markdown continuation.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 155.10, Immediate Support: 145.46

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and hold below 145.46.
- **Invalidation:** 155.74 (The low of the prior supply bar)
---
### AS (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance Continuation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH, and the monthly shows SUPPLY_DOMINANCE WATCH_FOR_TEST. The last weekly bar is a wide spread down, closing near the low (CLV -0.788) on moderate volume (RelVol 1.01). This confirms supply dominance. The strong rally attempt last week (CLV 0.98) was immediately rejected and sold off, indicating Smart Money distribution at 37.72-38.91 levels, continuing the markdown. The stock is weak.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 38.91, Immediate Support: 36.36

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and hold below 36.36 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** 37.74 (Recovery above the low of the rejection bar)
---
### ATO (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Markdown

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH, and the weekly shows a BUYING_CLIMAX WATCH_FOR_TEST (implying distribution). The last two weekly bars confirm the supply pressure. The prior week was high volume (RelVol 1.77) wide spread down, closing near the low (CLV -0.58). The latest bar is ultra-high volume (RelVol 2.82), moderate spread, and closes in the lower half (CLV -0.22). The massive volume confirms aggressive selling, and the poor close indicates supply is dominant, continuing the markdown.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 169.40, Immediate Support: 164.40

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and hold below 164.40.
- **Invalidation:** 170.73 (If the price recovers the high of the prior supply bar)
---
### AU (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Climactic Selling

**Smart Money Logic:**
Despite a BULLISH quarterly trend, the last weekly bar is extremely weak, confirming the SUPPLY_DOMINANCE signal. It is a massive spread down (24.42) on ultra-high volume (RelVol 2.02), closing near the absolute low (CLV -0.878). This is climactic selling, effectively reversing the strong four-week rally leading up to 115.81. Smart Money has aggressively distributed shares, confirming a major reversal or the start of a deep correction.

**Key Levels:** Major Resistance: 115.81, Immediate Support: 91.39

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on a break below 91.39, or on a low-volume retest of 100.00.
- **Invalidation:** 107.60 (Recovery above the prior week's high)
---
### AVAV (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Markdown Continuation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stock has experienced a classic blow-off top (Climax Bar 3 weeks ago: RelVol 2.09, Spread 103.40, CLV 0.876). The subsequent two weeks are decisive supply bars: massive spread down, high volume, closing near the absolute lows (CLV -0.827 and -0.926). This rapid markdown confirms the monthly BUYING_CLIMAX and the BEARISH quarterly context. Smart Money is aggressively selling, and a major downtrend is confirmed.

**Key Levels:** Major Resistance: 392.86 (Last rally high), Immediate Support: 276.76

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on break and hold below 276.76.
- **Invalidation:** 321.04 (Recovery above the high of the current supply bar)
---
### AXTI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax Failure / Markdown

**Smart Money Logic:**
Both weekly and monthly signals point to a BUYING_CLIMAX WATCH_FOR_TEST, confirming massive distribution after a significant run-up (RelVol 3.82 in week 2). The recent action shows a sharp markdown attempt (CLV -0.86 in week 4). The last bar, though on moderate volume (RelVol 1.94), is wide and closes poorly (CLV 0.18), failing to recover the open. This aggressive, volatile action confirms that the markdown from the climax is underway. Smart Money is unloading.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 20.38, Immediate Support: 15.85

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and hold below 15.85.
- **Invalidation:** 22.69 (Recovery above the low high of the climax breakdown)
---
### BABX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Effort No Result Up

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH, and the monthly shows SUPPLY_DOMINANCE WATCH_FOR_TEST. The last weekly bar is high volume (RelVol 1.36) with a wide spread, but closed near the low (CLV -0.88). This is a strong Effort No Result Up, confirming that supply is overwhelming demand, despite the recent volatile rally (41.00 to 53.35). Smart Money is likely distributing into the enthusiasm. The markdown is confirmed.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 53.11 (High of the distribution bar), Support: 46.36

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and hold below 46.36 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** 53.35 (If the climax high is breached)
---
### BAH (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Climactic Selling

**Smart Money Logic:**
Despite a BULLISH quarterly trend, the monthly shows a BUYING_CLIMAX WATCH_FOR_TEST. The last weekly bar is definitive: ultra-high volume (RelVol 1.92) and a massive spread down (15.80), closing near the low (CLV -0.845). This is climactic selling, effectively reversing the prior four-week rally. Smart Money has aggressively distributed shares near the 109.10 high. This signals a major reversal and the start of a markdown phase.

**Key Levels:** Major Resistance: 109.10, Immediate Support: 87.20

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on a break below 87.20, or on a low-volume retest of 95.00.
- **Invalidation:** 103.00 (Recovery above the open of the supply bar)
---
### BEP (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Demand Continuation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the monthly shows SUPPLY_DOMINANCE WATCH_FOR_TEST. However, the last weekly bar is strong: high volume (RelVol 1.41) and a wide spread up, closing in the upper half (CLV 0.408). This bar reverses the weakness seen in the prior two high-volume bars (Suggesting stopping volume/shakeout occurred earlier). The latest move shows strong demand returning, overcoming the recent supply and closing near the high. This is accumulation confirmation.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Resistance: 30.51, Support: 28.21

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Long entry on a breakout above 30.51.
- **Invalidation:** 28.21 (Break below the low of the demand bar)
---
### BHP (BEARISH WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax Reversal / Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the weekly shows a BUYING_CLIMAX WATCH_FOR_TEST. The last weekly bar saw ultra-high volume (RelVol 2.15) and a wide spread, but closed significantly off the high (CLV -0.673), rejecting the high of 74.98. This is a clear Effort No Result Up, confirming large institutional supply (distribution) at the highs. This action is reversing the four-week rally, suggesting a markdown phase is imminent.

**Key Levels:** Major Resistance: 74.98, Support: 67.51

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on break and hold below 67.51, or a failed low-volume retest of 70.00.
- **Invalidation:** 74.98 (If the price recovers the climax high)
---
### BKKT (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Markdown Continuation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH. The monthly chart shows BUYING_CLIMAX WATCH_FOR_TEST. The stock experienced an explosive move (2 weeks ago: RelVol 1.05, CLV 0.788) followed by two consecutive sharp reversals with high CLV negatives (-0.727, -0.669). The last bar saw moderate volume (RelVol 0.60), wide spread down, closing poorly. This suggests persistent supply and lack of demand, confirming the failure of the prior rally and continuation of the markdown phase.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 15.61, Immediate Support: 12.95

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and hold below 12.95 on strong volume.
- **Invalidation:** 19.78 (Recovery above the low high of the failure bar)
---
### BKSY (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax Failure / Markdown

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the monthly shows a BUYING_CLIMAX WATCH_FOR_TEST. The stock experienced three strong rally weeks (CLV > 0.14). The last bar shows a sharp reversal: high volume (RelVol 1.09) and a wide spread down, closing near the absolute low (CLV -0.916). This is a strong Supply Dominance signal, confirming that the high (29.79) was a climax and Smart Money is now initiating a markdown phase, likely failing the bullish quarterly trend in the short term.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 28.30, Immediate Support: 21.80

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and hold below 21.80.
- **Invalidation:** 28.30 (Recovery above the open of the supply bar)
---
### BL (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Context is BEARISH. The last weekly bar (2026-01-26) shows extremely high volume (RelVol 2.08) on a very wide spread down (9.19). The closing location (CLV -0.815) is near the low, confirming strong selling pressure and significant supply entering the market. This large move down on effort confirms the weakness signaled by the prior weekly supply sequence. This looks like a continuation of the monthly bearish trend (CLV -0.865 for Jan 2026).

**Key Levels:** 53.08 (Prior Low Close), 45.62 (Current Weekly Low Support), 56.70 (Recent Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 45.62 on confirmation of supply.
- **Invalidation:** 54.81 (Above the high of the last supply wave)
---
### BRKR (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax / Extreme Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Context is BEARISH. The Monthly sequence shows Stopping Volume, but the last weekly bar (2026-01-26) is extremely bearish: very wide spread down (6.96) on high volume (RelVol 1.007) closing near the low (CLV -0.781). This massive downward effort suggests heavy supply or a final capitulation phase (Selling Climax). Given the bearish quarterly trend, the odds favor supply continuation until accumulation is definitively confirmed. The prior Stopping Volume needs a successful test, which this bar is clearly not.

**Key Levels:** 50.49 (Recent Rally High), 43.53 (Current Weekly Low Support), 47.84 (Prior Swing Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** If short, entry below 43.53. If looking for reversal, wait for a low volume Test or No Supply bar near 43.53.
- **Invalidation:** 50.49 (Above the high of the last supply move)
---
### BROS (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Climactic Selling

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Context is BEARISH. The last weekly bar (2026-01-26) shows climactic volume (RelVol 2.89) on a very wide spread down (9.73), closing near the low (CLV -0.745). This is unmistakable climactic selling, suggesting panic or forced liquidation. Given the overall bearish trend, this could mark a Selling Climax, but the immediate indication is extreme supply overwhelming demand. Price needs to hold 53.15 and show immediate demand response, which is not currently present.

**Key Levels:** 62.88 (Immediate Resistance), 53.15 (Climax Low Support), 63.95 (Prior Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry below 53.15. If looking for accumulation, waiting for a clear low volume test of 53.15.
- **Invalidation:** 62.88 (Above the recent high)
---
### BRZE (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Monthly) / Extreme Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Context is BEARISH. The Monthly sequence showed a Buying Climax, which is now confirmed early. The weekly bar (2026-01-26) shows high volume (RelVol 1.77) on a wide spread down (5.39), closing near the absolute low (CLV -0.974). This is the definition of Supply Dominance and confirms the distribution phase signaled by the Monthly Buying Climax. The price drop is accelerating on increasing volume, indicating strong downward momentum.

**Key Levels:** 26.14 (Immediate Resistance), 20.75 (New Low Support), 34.53 (Major Resistance/Climax high)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 20.75 or retest of 23.00 with low volume failure.
- **Invalidation:** 26.14 (Above the high of the supply bar)
---
### BSY (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Context is BEARISH, and the Monthly sequence reinforces this with Supply Dominance. The last weekly bar (2026-01-26) shows above-average volume (RelVol 1.2) on a wide spread down (4.58), closing near the low (CLV -0.725). This is a clear sign of weakness and supply continuation, accelerating the bearish trend. Smart Money is clearly selling, forcing price lower.

**Key Levels:** 39.07 (Immediate Resistance), 34.49 (New Low Support), 40.66 (Prior High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 34.49 on supply confirmation.
- **Invalidation:** 39.07 (Above the high of the supply bar)
---
### BWIN (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Context is BEARISH, and the Monthly sequence confirms Supply Dominance. The last weekly bar (2026-01-26) shows high volume (RelVol 1.46) on a wide spread down (3.99), closing near the low (CLV -0.969). This is strong confirmation of supply dominance and continuation of the bearish trend, potentially breaking below key support levels.

**Key Levels:** 25.85 (Immediate Resistance), 21.86 (New Low Support), 24.66 (Prior Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 21.86 on sustained volume.
- **Invalidation:** 25.85 (Above the high of the supply bar)
---
### BXSL (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Context is BEARISH, reinforced by the Monthly Supply Dominance sequence. The last weekly bar (2026-01-26) shows high volume (RelVol 1.05) on a wide spread down (0.92), closing near the low (CLV -0.826). This confirms strong selling pressure pushing the price down toward new lows, consistent with the overall bearish trend and supply dominance.

**Key Levels:** 26.50 (Immediate Resistance), 25.58 (New Low Support), 26.28 (Prior Swing High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 25.58 on sustained volume.
- **Invalidation:** 26.50 (Above the high of the supply bar)
---
### CAI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Extreme Selling

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Context is BEARISH, and the weekly sequence shows Supply Dominance. The last weekly bar (2026-01-26) has very high volume (RelVol 1.96) on a wide spread down, closing extremely near the low (CLV -0.986). This is an exceptionally strong confirmation of supply dominance, driving the price towards new lows. The selling pressure is accelerating and intense.

**Key Levels:** 26.85 (Immediate Resistance), 23.14 (New Low Support), 29.32 (Prior High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 23.14 on confirmation of supply.
- **Invalidation:** 26.85 (Above the high of the supply bar)
---
### CALM (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Demand Confirmation (Absorption)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Context is BULLISH. The weekly sequence flagged Supply Dominance previously, but the latest weekly bar (2026-01-26) shows high volume (RelVol 1.51) on a wide spread up, closing near the high (CLV 0.463, mid-upper range). This strong upward close on high volume, following climactic action (Stopping Volume/Demand entering in prior weeks), suggests successful absorption of selling and a strong continuation of demand, overriding the recent supply warnings. The monthly CLV (0.791) also shows strength.

**Key Levels:** 84.88 (New High/Resistance), 79.85 (Immediate Support), 71.92 (Monthly Low Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A low volume pull back (Test/No Supply) toward 80.35, or break above 84.88.
- **Invalidation:** 79.85 (Below the low of the last up-bar)
---
### CALX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Climactic Selling

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Context is BEARISH. The weekly sequence shows strong Supply Dominance. The last weekly bar (2026-01-26) exhibits extremely high volume (RelVol 3.38) on a massive spread down (13.07), closing extremely near the low (CLV -0.935). This is massive institutional selling or a major capitulation (Selling Climax). Given the bearish quarterly trend, this signals intense weakness and potential for new lows unless immediate reversal signals appear.

**Key Levels:** 57.32 (Immediate Resistance), 44.25 (Climax Low Support), 61.91 (Prior High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry below 44.25 on confirmation. Wait for low volume Test before considering a long reversal.
- **Invalidation:** 57.32 (Above the high of the climax bar)
---
### CCOI (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Demand Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Context is BULLISH, though the Monthly sequence indicates a Buying Climax. The last weekly bar (2026-01-26) is a narrow spread bar on below-average volume (RelVol 0.56) that closes near the high (CLV 0.406). The prior week was also an up-close on low volume. This combination suggests that the Smart Money activity (likely accumulation during the large monthly volatility) is now confirmed by modest demand effort pushing the price up without excessive expenditure (No Supply characteristics). This confirms demand strength.

**Key Levels:** 24.81 (Immediate Resistance), 23.09 (Immediate Support), 25.05 (Monthly High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 24.81 with renewed volume.
- **Invalidation:** 23.09 (Below the low of the last up-bar)
---
### CNXC (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Context is BULLISH, but the weekly sequence indicates Stopping Volume. However, the last weekly bar (2026-01-26) shows high volume (RelVol 1.43) on a very wide spread down (7.44), closing near the low (CLV -0.637). This massive rejection from the prior week's high confirms overwhelming supply entering the market, negating the bullish quarterly context for now. This is a severe shakeout or outright supply dominance.

**Key Levels:** 43.44 (Immediate Resistance), 36.00 (New Low Support), 44.78 (Monthly High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 36.00 on confirmation of supply.
- **Invalidation:** 43.44 (Above the high of the supply bar)
---
### CORT (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Upthrust

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Context is BEARISH. The monthly sequence shows a Buying Climax. The last weekly bar (2026-01-26) shows very high volume (RelVol 2.29) on a wide spread up, but the close is significantly off the high (CLV -0.401). This is a strong Upthrust or Effort No Result Up, confirming heavy supply entering the market near 47.06. This is consistent with distribution following the monthly Buying Climax, suggesting Smart Money is selling into the rally.

**Key Levels:** 47.06 (Upthrust/Resistance), 36.80 (Immediate Support), 44.84 (Prior Swing High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 36.80 on confirmation of supply.
- **Invalidation:** 47.06 (Above the Upthrust high)
---
### CSGP (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Effort No Result (Down)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Context is BEARISH, reinforced by both weekly and monthly Supply Dominance sequences. The last weekly bar (2026-01-26) shows high volume (RelVol 1.82) on a wide spread down, closing near the low (CLV -0.851). This is a strong confirmation of supply dominating the market, accelerating the downtrend. The Smart Money is decisively bearish, leading to new weakness.

**Key Levels:** 70.57 (Resistance/High), 60.77 (New Low Support), 67.95 (Prior Swing High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 60.77 on supply confirmation.
- **Invalidation:** 70.57 (Above the high of the supply bar)
---
### CTRA (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result (Up) -> Demand Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Context is BULLISH, though the weekly sequence flagged a Buying Climax early. The last weekly bar (2026-01-26) shows high volume (RelVol 1.36) on a wide spread up, closing near the high (CLV 0.796). This is strong demand confirmation, overriding the previous week's bearish signal (CLV -0.457). The market is confirming the continuation of the bullish trend, pushing past immediate resistance levels.

**Key Levels:** 29.06 (New High/Resistance), 27.00 (Immediate Support), 28.48 (Prior Swing High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 29.06 or a low volume pullback to 27.80.
- **Invalidation:** 27.00 (Below the low of the last strong demand bar)
---
### CVS (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Extreme Selling

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Context is BEARISH, and the weekly sequence shows Supply Dominance. The last weekly bar (2026-01-26) shows extreme volume (RelVol 2.48) on a massive wide spread down (13.31), closing significantly off the low (CLV -0.424). This is massive institutional selling or a Selling Climax. Although the CLV is off the low, the sheer volume spike suggests a profound bearish commitment. Given the bearish context, supply dominance is the primary read, but the climactic volume warrants caution and monitoring for a bounce.

**Key Levels:** 84.00 (Resistance/High), 70.69 (Climax Low Support), 82.61 (Prior High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry below 70.69 on confirmation. Or wait for volatility stabilization.
- **Invalidation:** 84.00 (Above the climax high)
---

**Smart Money Logic:**

**Smart Money Logic:**
Wk 5 shows maximum selling effort (1.69 RelVol) resulting in maximum downward result (4.95 spread, -0.91 CLV). This confirms significant institutional liquidation. Given the overall weakness, this SC is likely just a continuation signal until proven otherwise by a low-volume test and rally.

**VSA Status:** Effort No Result

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart shows a significant BUYING CLIMAX in 2026-01 (High volume, wide spread, CLV near low/mid-range at -0.14).

The last Weekly bar (2026-01-26) confirms this distribution with very high relative volume (1.63x) and a wide down spread, closing near the low (CLV -0.05). This is strong Supply overcoming previous demand efforts.

The most recent bar (2026-01-26) is the strongest evidence of Supply Dominance: extreme volume, wide down spread, closing at the absolute low (CLV -0.91). This confirms the distribution detected by the weekly algo and suggests the prior rally was likely an Upthrust into Supply.

**Key Levels:** 34.48 (Recent High/Supply), 30.77 (Last Week Low/Support Break), 28.62 (Monthly Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Continuation short below $30.77 or a rejection rally (Upthrust) back towards $32.99.
- **Invalidation:** $33.46 (Above last week's high)

### SATS (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Both the Monthly (Buying Climax, CLV -0.54) and the Weekly charts show extreme weakness. The last Weekly bar (2026-01-26) is a classic example of Supply Dominance: highest volume of the past 5 weeks (2.05x), widest spread down, and closing near the absolute low (CLV -0.67). This marks a sharp reversal from the Jan 19 bullish candle (CLV 0.49). Smart Money is liquidating heavily.

**Key Levels:** 132.25 (Monthly High/Climax), 109.57 (Last Week Low/Key Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on break below $109.57 or on a weak test back toward $126.00.
- **Invalidation:** $131.94 (Above last week's high/prevents Upthrust trap)
---
### SCZ (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
SCZ experienced a sudden influx of supply in the last Weekly bar (2026-01-26), indicated by high volume (1.95x) and a wide down spread closing near the low (CLV -0.82). This immediately followed a very strong bullish week (CLV 0.94), suggesting a reversal or Upthrust action above $82. This sudden shift in character on high volume confirms the Supply Dominance signal.

**Key Levels:** 83.66 (Last Week High/Upthrust), 81.58 (Last Week Low), 79.70 (Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on a close below $81.58 or if price tests $82.60 and fails on low volume.
- **Invalidation:** $83.67 (Above the high of the Supply bar)
---
### SONY (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH, and the latest Weekly bar (2026-01-26) confirms the ongoing downtrend severity. Volume is highest in the past 5 weeks (2.25x), accompanying a wide down spread and a close near the low (CLV -0.54). The Monthly chart also shows extreme bearishness (CLV -0.86 in Jan 2026). This is clear liquidation and confirmation of Smart Money controlling the downside.

**Key Levels:** 23.13 (Minor Resistance), 21.80 (Last Week Low/Current Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on a break below $21.80 or a failed rally attempt toward $23.10.
- **Invalidation:** $23.96 (Above the high of the Jan 19 supply bar)
---
### SPOT (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH. The last Weekly bar (2026-01-26) confirms the Supply Dominance detected by the algo. High relative volume (1.16x) leads to a wide down spread, closing in the lower half (CLV -0.47). The previous two weeks featured extreme volume and poor closes (CLV -0.91, -0.84), confirming persistent distribution. The recent bounce was weak, and supply is reasserting control.

**Key Levels:** 520.00 (Recent Supply/Resistance), 493.31 (Last Week Low/Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on breakdown below $493.31.
- **Invalidation:** $517.00 (Above the high of the weak rally week)
---
### STM (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last Weekly bar (2026-01-26) is a strong display of Supply Dominance, reversing the prior week's strength. Extreme relative volume (1.98x) and a wide spread down, closing near the low (CLV -0.79), indicates aggressive selling. This overwhelms the Quarterly BULLISH TREND and suggests major distribution is occurring near the highs ($30.41).

**Key Levels:** 30.41 (Recent High/Supply), 27.60 (Last Week Low/Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on a break below $27.60 or a weak rally towards $28.60.
- **Invalidation:** $29.37 (Above the high of the Jan 19 demand bar)
---
### SYF (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH. The last Weekly bar (2026-01-26) shows extreme volume (2.47x) on a very wide down spread, closing near the low (CLV -0.72). This is clear liquidation following an Upthrust attempt in early January, which failed spectacularly. The Monthly chart also confirms massive weakness (CLV -0.90). Supply is firmly in control.

**Key Levels:** 77.57 (Last Week High/Resistance), 71.86 (Last Week Low/Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on continuation below $71.86.
- **Invalidation:** $77.58 (Above the high of the supply bar)
---
### TRU (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result

**Smart Money Logic:**
Despite the Monthly chart detecting Stopping Volume, the last Weekly bar (2026-01-26) shows Effort Without Result down. High volume (1.01x) with a wide spread down, but the market closes near the low (CLV -0.87) confirming a strong push lower into the Quarterly BEARISH TREND. The massive volume on the last weekly bar suggests liquidation is accelerating, overwhelming any potential accumulation signaled previously.

**Key Levels:** 85.14 (Resistance), 78.60 (Last Week Low/Support), 81.71 (Minor Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on a break below $78.60.
- **Invalidation:** $84.16 (Above last week's open/minor resistance)
---
### TXT (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Despite the Quarterly BULLISH TREND, the last Weekly bar (2026-01-26) shows a decisive reversal marked by Supply Dominance. Very high relative volume (2.30x) on a wide down spread, closing poorly (CLV -0.34), reversing several weeks of upward movement. This indicates a major selling event by Smart Money likely forming a secondary distribution phase after the failure to hold the high ($96.98).

**Key Levels:** 96.98 (Recent High/Supply), 84.32 (Last Week Low/Critical Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on a break below $88.00, targeting the $84.32 low.
- **Invalidation:** $95.72 (Above the high of the supply bar)
---
### UNH (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH. The last Weekly bar (2026-01-26) is catastrophic: extreme volume (3.21x), massive spread down, and closing near the absolute low (CLV -0.82). This confirms a major liquidation event, likely related to bad news or institutional dumping, and severely violates the recent base formation. This is a follow-through to the prior Monthly weakness.

**Key Levels:** 357.87 (Recent High/Supply), 280.40 (Last Week Low/New Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on any weak rally toward $300 or continuation break below $280.40.
- **Invalidation:** $344.00 (Above the Jan 5 minor rally close)
---
### WGMI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart detected a Buying Climax. The last Weekly bar (2026-01-26) shows high relative volume (1.48x) on a wide down spread, closing near the low (CLV -0.82). This is a strong sign of Supply Dominance following the prior week's high volume but poor-closing bullish bar (Jan 19, CLV 0.37). The current action signals the climax/reversal is in play, overriding the Quarterly BULLISH TREND.

**Key Levels:** 52.01 (Recent High/Supply), 44.39 (Last Week Low/Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on continuation below $44.39 or a weak rally back toward $48.77.
- **Invalidation:** $51.06 (Above the close of the Jan 12 demand bar)
---
### WH (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH. The last Weekly bar (2026-01-26) shows a marked increase in volume (1.89x) with a wide down spread, closing poorly (CLV -0.34). This confirms the Supply Dominance detected by the algo and suggests strong institutional liquidation. The previous week's supply was already present (Jan 19, CLV -0.47). The immediate short-term trend is firmly down.

**Key Levels:** 77.30 (Resistance), 70.59 (Last Week Low/Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on break below $70.59.
- **Invalidation:** $77.52 (Above the Dec 29 high/prevents Upthrust trap)
---
### WPM (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last Weekly bar (2026-01-26) shows extreme volume (2.42x) and the widest spread of the past 5 weeks, closing near the low (CLV -0.89). This is a massive reversal following a strong uptrend and confirms a Buying Climax/Supply Dominance event. Smart Money is aggressively liquidating profits or distributing stock at these high levels, overriding the Quarterly BULLISH TREND, suggesting a major market top.

**Key Levels:** 160.36 (Climax High/Supply), 130.33 (Last Week Low/Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on a break below $130.33.
- **Invalidation:** $147.28 (Above the high of the prior bullish bar)
---
## 👀 Watch/Monitoring
### ABT (BEARISH (Short-term Relief))
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart shows extreme Supply Dominance (high volume, wide spread down, negative CLV: -0.666). The last Weekly bar confirms this massive move down (spread 5.12, RelVol 2.79) but closes in the upper half (CLV 0.574). This suggests professional buying (Stopping Volume) absorbing the panic selling after the prior week's ultra-high volume (RelVol 2.57) massive down bar (Spread 16.7). However, the overall monthly/quarterly context remains very weak (BEARISH_TREND, SUPPLY_DOMINANCE). Expect a test of supply, but the immediate major trend is down.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 110.39 (Last week's high), Support: 105.27 (Last week's low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for confirmation of successful absorption (No Supply Test) near 107.00/105.27, or confirmation of supply continuation below 105.27.
- **Invalidation:** 111.00 (If price closes strongly above this level, the VSA outlook flips bullish)
---
### ACLX (NEUTRAL/BEARISH WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Effort to Rise Failing

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the monthly sequence is under SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. Two weeks ago, there was high volume (RelVol 1.51) and a very wide spread, but the price closed poorly (CLV -0.676). This indicates Effort No Result Down (or heavy supply). The latest bar is lower volume (RelVol 1.12), small spread, but closes mid-range. While the price held 66.50 support, the preceding massive supply bar suggests Smart Money distributed near 76.50. Needs more evidence of absorption.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Resistance: 70.11, Major Support: 66.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** BULLISH: Confirmation of No Supply Test near 66.00. BEARISH: Break below 66.00 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** 76.50 (If supply is re-absorbed and highs are taken out)
---
### ACN (BEARISH (Monitor for Secondary Test))
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Shortening of the Thrust Down

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the monthly bar shows Stopping Volume is WATCH_FOR_TEST, driven by the last week's sharp downturn. The last weekly bar closed near its low (CLV -0.539) on high volume (RelVol 1.23) and a wide spread, indicating strong immediate supply pressure. This bar is a clear sign of weakness. While the monthly signal hints at prior buying, this weekly supply is dominating the immediate action. The setup looks like a Phase C breakdown within a wider trading range, testing the prior accumulation area.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Support: 257.37, Resistance: 284.59 (Last week's high)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on a confirmed break below 257.37, or wait for a low-volume reaction test back to 270.00.
- **Invalidation:** 286.57 (If price recovers and closes above the prior swing high)
---
### AGIO (NEUTRAL/BULLISH WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Rejection / Shortening of the Thrust Down

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stock is in a BEARISH quarterly trend, but the monthly chart shows a STOPPING_VOLUME WATCH_FOR_TEST. The last weekly bar is a wide spread down on moderate volume (RelVol 0.84), closing in the bottom half (CLV -0.67), suggesting immediate supply. However, the last few bars show reduced spread magnitude compared to the explosive moves in prior months (Nov/Dec). The buying climax/stopping volume suggested earlier may be initiating a new trading range. Needs a clear confirmation of buying strength (e.g., No Supply Test).

**Key Levels:** Immediate Resistance: 29.93, Support: 26.25

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** BULLISH: Low volume test near 27.00. BEARISH: Break below 26.25 on high volume.
- **Invalidation:** 26.25 (Break below this support confirms weakness)
---
### AHR (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax Rejection

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the stock is exhibiting Buying Climax behavior on both weekly and monthly charts. The latest weekly bar shows ultra-high volume (RelVol 4.37) but a narrow spread and a close near the middle (CLV 0.15). This massive volume with little progress indicates heavy supply meeting demand, potentially a Shakeout or a very aggressive Up-Thrust. Given the prior week's clear supply bar (CLV -0.71), this high-volume bar is likely absorption of demand, confirming the climax.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 48.04, Support: 45.37

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry below 45.37, confirming the supply.
- **Invalidation:** 48.80 (High of the previous supply bar must hold)
---
### AIG (NEUTRAL/BULLISH WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Supply Absorption

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly chart shows CONFIRMED_EARLY Supply Dominance, consistent with the BEARISH Quarterly context. However, the last weekly bar is key: high volume (RelVol 0.82) but closes near the high of its range (CLV 0.96). This is a potential Stopping Volume signal, absorbing the heavy selling from the prior two massive supply weeks (RelVol 1.80 and 1.74). Smart Money appears to be stepping in, halting the immediate markdown. This setup is highly volatile but suggests a potential short-term reversal or the formation of a base.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Resistance: 74.92, Support: 72.80 (The open of the stopping volume bar)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** BULLISH: Low volume test (No Supply) toward 72.80. Long entry on confirmed No Supply.
- **Invalidation:** 72.11 (If price breaks below the prior low on subsequent supply)
---
### AKAM (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Supply Rejection

**Smart Money Logic:**
The BULLISH quarterly trend is under pressure from a Weekly BUYING_CLIMAX WATCH_FOR_TEST. The last weekly bar saw ultra-high volume (RelVol 1.93) and a wide spread, but closed sharply off the high (CLV -0.731). This signifies strong supply entering the market, rejecting the high (104.98). This is a classic Up-thrust or Effort No Result Up, indicating distribution.

**Key Levels:** Major Resistance: 104.98, Support: 95.93

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on a confirmed low-volume rally failure (No Demand) back to 100.00, or a break below 95.93.
- **Invalidation:** 104.98 (If the price exceeds this climax high)
---
### AL (NEUTRAL/BULLISH WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Effort to Rise (Weakness)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stock is in a strong BULLISH Quarterly trend. The monthly chart shows a BUYING_CLIMAX WATCH_FOR_TEST, but the last weekly bar closed at the absolute high (CLV 1.0) on moderate volume (RelVol 0.84). This suggests continued strength into the end of the week. However, the range is extremely narrow across the last 5 weeks (all spreads < 0.3), suggesting institutional interest is low, or the stock is tightly held. The high CLV is positive, but the narrow action is cautious, possibly masking underlying weakness from the monthly climax context.

**Key Levels:** Support: 64.35, Resistance: 64.63

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Long entry on confirmed high volume breakout above 64.63.
- **Invalidation:** 64.06 (Break below the prior consolidation low)
---
### ALC (NEUTRAL/BULLISH WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Supply Absorption

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH. The monthly shows STOPPING_VOLUME WATCH_FOR_TEST. The last weekly bar is low volume (RelVol 0.73), small spread, closing mid-range/upper half (CLV 0.103). This indicates a lack of selling pressure after recent supply in the prior weeks. The pattern suggests professional action is holding the price within a tight range (79.80-81.93), potentially absorbing remaining supply before a push higher. The context suggests accumulation after a period of weakness.

**Key Levels:** Support: 79.81, Resistance: 81.93

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Long entry on a high volume breakout above 81.93.
- **Invalidation:** 78.26 (Break below the range support)
---
### ALL (BULLISH WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance Reversal / Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH, but the weekly setup is conflicting. Two weeks ago showed massive Supply Dominance (RelVol 2.04, CLV -0.949). The latest bar is a reversal: moderate volume (RelVol 0.97) and a wide spread up, closing near the high (CLV 0.715). This indicates strong professional buying (Stopping Volume) absorbing the earlier panic selling. This reversal on strong effort suggests the short-term low may be in, forming a spring/reversal action.

**Key Levels:** Support: 191.80 (Spring low), Resistance: 200.04

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a low-volume test (No Supply) towards 195.00. Long entry on confirmed NS.
- **Invalidation:** 191.80 (If the spring low is broken)
---
### AMH (NEUTRAL/BULLISH WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result Down / Secondary Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly chart shows STOPPING_VOLUME WATCH_FOR_TEST, which is positive within the BEARISH quarterly context. The last weekly bar is moderate volume (RelVol 1.20), narrow spread, and closes mid-range/low (CLV -0.052), indicating slight weakness, but crucially, the low (30.60) did not challenge the stopping volume low (28.85 from 3 weeks prior). This low volume reaction suggests sellers are losing interest (No Supply). This low-volume retest makes a potential spring/accumulation setup viable.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 32.45, Support: 30.60

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Long entry on confirmed No Supply behavior (low volume bounce from 30.60).
- **Invalidation:** 30.50 (Break below the low of the ST low volume test)
---
### AMZU (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance Continuation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH, and the monthly shows SUPPLY_DOMINANCE WATCH_FOR_TEST. The last weekly bar is a wide spread down, closing near the low (CLV -0.556) on moderate volume (RelVol 0.97). This confirms the supply pressure is still active, continuing the markdown from the prior high-volume rejection bar two weeks ago. Although the CLV is only moderately negative, the low volume rally attempt last week failed, confirming seller control.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 37.28, Support: 36.24

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on break below 36.24.
- **Invalidation:** 39.71 (High of the failed rally bar)
---
### APLS (NEUTRAL/BULLISH WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Shakeout

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stock is in a BULLISH quarterly trend. The monthly shows STOPPING_VOLUME WATCH_FOR_TEST. The last weekly bar is ultra-high volume (RelVol 3.11) with a wide spread down, closing mid-range (CLV 0.10). This follows a massive supply week (CLV -0.94, RelVol 1.54) that broke prior support. The current high-volume bar is likely a Shakeout, flushing out weak hands, with professionals aggressively accumulating at the lows (21.10). The context suggests accumulation or spring action.

**Key Levels:** Support: 21.10 (Shakeout low), Resistance: 23.79

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Long entry on confirmed follow-through buying (e.g., strong close above 23.79).
- **Invalidation:** 21.10 (Break below the shakeout low)
---
### ARE (BEARISH WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Effort No Result Down

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the monthly shows STOPPING_VOLUME WATCH_FOR_TEST. The last weekly bar is high volume (RelVol 1.67) and a wide spread down, closing near the low (CLV -0.546). This suggests significant supply entered the market and was absorbed, possibly marking a Selling Climax, but the close in the lower half indicates immediate supply dominance. Given the rally preceding this, Smart Money may be distributing. This bar is weak and necessitates caution.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 59.75 (High of the bar), Support: 53.14

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry below 53.14. BULLISH: Confirmed No Supply test near 53.14.
- **Invalidation:** 59.75 (If high is exceeded)
---
### ARWR (NEUTRAL/BULLISH WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Weak)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the weekly chart shows CONFIRMED_EARLY Supply Dominance. The aggressive selling bar three weeks ago (RelVol 2.19, CLV -0.51) was followed by two weeks of moderate volume (RelVol 0.63, 1.14). The last bar is a wide spread up on increased volume (RelVol 1.14), but the close is middling (CLV 0.18). This volume suggests professional buying, but the poor close shows supply resistance is still present. It’s an indication of Stopping Volume, but it needs follow-through buying to confirm accumulation.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 72.00, Support: 65.45

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Long entry on strong close above 72.00, or a low-volume test of 65.45.
- **Invalidation:** 63.33 (Break below the prior accumulation low)
---
### ASML (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax Reversal

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the weekly sequence shows a BUYING_CLIMAX WATCH_FOR_TEST. The stock has rallied strongly for four weeks. The last bar is climactic: ultra-high volume (RelVol 2.22) and a very wide spread, but closed significantly off the high (CLV -0.301). This is a strong signal of institutional supply entering the market (Effort No Result Up/Up-Thrust). The failure to hold gains on such high volume is a major sign of distribution near the 1493 peak.

**Key Levels:** Major Resistance: 1493.48, Support: 1385.16

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on a confirmed break below 1385.16 or failed retest of 1450.
- **Invalidation:** 1493.48 (If price recovers the climax high)
---
### AVNT (BEARISH WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Effort No Result Up

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BULLISH. The weekly chart confirms SUPPLY_DOMINANCE WATCH_FOR_TEST. The stock has been rallying with decreasing volume until the last bar. The latest weekly bar is ultra-high volume (RelVol 2.00) but a wide spread down, closing in the lower half (CLV -0.338). This signals strong selling pressure (Effort No Result Up/Up-Thrust) rejecting the high of 37.77. Smart Money is distributing after an extended rally.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 37.77, Support: 35.35

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on a break below 35.35 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** 37.77 (If the price exceeds this high)
---
### AXTA (NEUTRAL/BULLISH WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Rejection / Secondary Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH, though the monthly shows STOPPING_VOLUME WATCH_FOR_TEST. The last five weeks show tight, consolidating price action. The last weekly bar is moderate volume (RelVol 0.75), narrow spread, closing in the lower half (CLV -0.57), suggesting some supply rejection at the high (34.50). However, the overall lack of selling conviction below 33.33, and the low volume, suggests sellers are not aggressive. This could be a normal shakeout before an uptrend resumes.

**Key Levels:** Support: 33.33, Resistance: 34.50

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Long entry on confirmed breakout above 34.50.
- **Invalidation:** 32.80 (Break below the prior consolidation low)
---
### AZN (NEUTRAL/BEARISH WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Secondary Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the weekly shows STOPPING_VOLUME WATCH_FOR_TEST. The previous two weeks showed mixed signals: a massive volume down bar (RelVol 3.30) followed by a low volume rally (RelVol 1.08, CLV 0.97). The last bar is the Secondary Test: wide spread down, high volume (RelVol 1.31), closing poorly (CLV -0.83). This high volume selling pressure on the test suggests supply is still very present, potentially failing the accumulation attempt (Stopping Volume).

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 96.18, Support: 92.46 (Last week's low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on break below 92.46, confirming supply continuation.
- **Invalidation:** 92.95 (If price recovers the prior consolidation high)
---
### BANC (NEUTRAL/BEARISH WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Effort No Result Down

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the monthly signal is a CONFIRMED_STRONG Buying Climax. The last two weekly bars show conflicting signals within a narrow range. Two weeks ago was a strong supply bar (CLV -0.96, RelVol 0.97). The latest bar is low volume (RelVol 0.83), narrow spread, closing mid-range (CLV -0.16). This low volume reaction suggests No Demand, indicating weakness after the previous supply bar. This pattern supports the confirmed monthly climax distribution thesis.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 20.41, Support: 19.67

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on break below 19.67.
- **Invalidation:** 21.61 (High of the latest supply wave)
---
### BBIO (NEUTRAL/BULLISH WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Rejection / Potential Secondary Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH, and the weekly shows STOPPING_VOLUME WATCH_FOR_TEST. The price saw aggressive supply two weeks ago (RelVol 2.03, wide spread down) followed by a strong recovery last week (CLV 0.08, moderate volume). The latest bar is high volume (RelVol 1.11), narrow spread, closing mid-range/low (CLV -0.309). This volume increase without a clear markdown suggests supply is still present but being absorbed. The prior test (70.95) held, suggesting accumulation is underway.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 80.00, Support: 75.83

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Long entry on confirmed No Supply test near 75.83.
- **Invalidation:** 70.95 (Break below the low of the major Stopping Volume bar)
---
### BBT (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result Down / Lack of Conviction

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the monthly shows a BUYING_CLIMAX WATCH_FOR_TEST. The last five weeks show consolidating action in a narrow range (25.93-29.63). The last weekly bar is high volume (RelVol 1.20) but a narrow spread, closing poorly (CLV -0.07). This high volume with minimal gain suggests institutional supply is meeting demand, confirming the monthly climax idea. However, the price hasn't broken down aggressively yet, indicating a potential trading range is forming.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 29.09, Support: 27.71

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Breakout above 29.63 or breakdown below 27.71.
- **Invalidation:** 29.63 (High of the climax)

### BBWI (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Potential Stopping Volume (Weak)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the monthly shows SUPPLY_DOMINANCE WATCH_FOR_TEST. The last two weekly bars show high volume selling pressure (RelVol 0.80, Spread 1.59). The last bar closed mid-range/high (CLV 0.61) despite the prior week being weak (CLV -0.13). This suggests absorption occurred at the low (20.52). However, volume is not climactic, and the close is only moderate, indicating lack of conviction in either direction. Consolidation is likely here.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 22.11, Support: 20.52

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Long entry on confirmation above 22.11. Short entry below 20.52.
- **Invalidation:** 20.52 (If support breaks)
---
### BE (NEUTRAL/BULLISH WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Supply Rejection

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH, and the monthly shows STOPPING_VOLUME WATCH_FOR_TEST, confirming recent heavy selling. The last weekly bar is high volume (RelVol 1.02) and a wide spread, but it closed significantly off the low (CLV -0.034), indicating absorption of supply near 136.25. This stopping volume is acting as a shakeout after the explosive rally of the prior two weeks. The potential for a Secondary Test near the low is high.

**Key Levels:** Support: 136.25 (Shakeout low), Resistance: 167.57 (High of the climactic action)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a low-volume test (No Supply) toward 140.00. Long entry on confirmed NS.
- **Invalidation:** 136.25 (Break below the shakeout low)
---
### BFH (NEUTRAL/BULLISH WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Demand Rejection

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH, and the weekly shows STOPPING_VOLUME WATCH_FOR_TEST. A high-volume supply bar occurred two weeks ago (RelVol 2.26, CLV 0.86), which was a shakeout that reversed into strength. The last bar, though high volume (RelVol 1.54) and wide spread up, closed mid-range/high (CLV 0.44). This suggests strong demand is present, rejecting the low (68.07) and moving higher, indicating accumulation is in progress despite the bearish monthly CLV (-0.33).

**Key Levels:** Immediate Support: 68.07 (Shakeout Low), Resistance: 74.27

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Long entry on confirmed No Supply test near 69.50.
- **Invalidation:** 68.07 (Break below shakeout low)
---
### BHF (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Lack of Interest / Low Volatility

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH, but the monthly shows BUYING_CLIMAX WATCH_FOR_TEST. The price has been consolidating in an extremely tight range for five weeks (Spread < 1.0) on consistently low volume (RelVol < 0.67). The last bar is particularly narrow (0.40 spread) with low volume (RelVol 0.43) and a poor close (CLV -0.70). The tight price action suggests an equilibrium, but the low volume and poor close hint at slight underlying weakness in the absence of demand. Given the bearish quarterly context, this quietness is cautious.

**Key Levels:** Range Resistance: 64.69, Range Support: 63.80

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for definitive volume and spread expansion outside the current tight range.
- **Invalidation:** 63.79 (Break below range support)
---
### BKR (BEARISH WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax Reversal / Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the weekly sequence shows a BUYING_CLIMAX WATCH_FOR_TEST. The last weekly bar saw ultra-high volume (RelVol 1.87) and a wide spread, but closed significantly off the high (CLV -0.336), rejecting the 58.50 peak. This is a clear sign of massive supply entering the market (Effort No Result Up/Up-Thrust), confirming distribution after a multi-week rally. Expect a correction or the formation of a trading range.

**Key Levels:** Major Resistance: 58.50, Support: 54.82

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on confirmed break below 54.82 or a failed low-volume retest of 56.00.
- **Invalidation:** 58.50 (If the price exceeds the climax high)
---
### BNDX (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Effort No Result (Down)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Context is BULLISH, but the weekly sequence indicates a potential Buying Climax followed by monitoring for a test. The last weekly bar (2026-01-26) has high volume (RelVol 1.89) but a narrow spread and a CLV of -0.176 (closing slightly below mid-range). This suggests heavy effort to push the price higher met with commensurate selling/distribution, especially considering the prior week's ultra-high volume (RelVol 2.85) bar with a similar neutral close, confirming Stopping Volume/Climactic action weeks ago. This is a period of absorption/distribution.

**Key Levels:** 48.67 (Recent High/Resistance), 48.33 (Short-term support), 47.15 (Monthly Low Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A clear No Demand test on low volume, or a break below 48.33 with increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** 48.67 (Break above the recent high)
---
### BNS (NEUTRAL to BEARISH bias)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Context is BULLISH, but the weekly sequence shows Supply Dominance being watched. The last weekly bar (2026-01-26) shows high volume (RelVol 1.07) on a wide up-bar, but the close (CLV -0.586) is significantly off the high. This is weakness appearing on an attempt to rally. Despite the bullish quarterly context, this price rejection on high volume suggests professional selling (Upthrust/Effort No Result Up).

**Key Levels:** 76.56 (Recent High/Selling Zone), 74.24 (Immediate Support), 71.63 (Major Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A subsequent weekly bar closing below 74.24 on supply/volume confirmation.
- **Invalidation:** 76.56 (New high above resistance)
---
### BP (NEUTRAL to BEARISH bias)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Effort No Result Up)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Context is BULLISH, but the weekly sequence is confirmed early for Supply Dominance. The last weekly bar (2026-01-26) has very high volume (RelVol 1.48) and a wide spread up, but the close (CLV 0.168) is significantly off the high, suggesting a failed rally attempt (Effort No Result Up). Professional sellers absorbed the buying pressure near 38.89. This action confirms the current supply dominance.

**Key Levels:** 38.89 (Resistance/High of supply), 36.46 (Immediate Support), 35.03 (Key Swing Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A decisive break and close below 36.46, confirming the selling pressure.
- **Invalidation:** 38.89 (Break above the high of the supply bar)
---
### BRBR (NEUTRAL to BEARISH bias)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax / Failed Rally

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Context is BEARISH. The Monthly sequence indicates Stopping Volume, suggesting a potential bottom, but the recent weekly action is concerning. The second-to-last week (2026-01-19) showed a strong rally (CLV 0.665) on average volume (RelVol 1.03). However, the last weekly bar (2026-01-26) has high volume (RelVol 1.4) and closes significantly down (CLV -0.672). This failed rally/rejection on high volume indicates that the supply still dominates the market, overriding the Stopping Volume signal temporarily. The price failed to hold the high ground.

**Key Levels:** 27.11 (Immediate Supply/Resistance), 24.43 (Recent Support Low), 21.67 (Key Support/Stopping Volume Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below 24.43 on supply confirmation.
- **Invalidation:** 28.26 (Above the high of the failed rally)
---
### BVN (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Climactic Selling

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Context is BULLISH, but the weekly sequence indicates Supply Dominance. The last weekly bar (2026-01-26) shows extremely high volume (RelVol 1.95) on a very wide spread down (7.86), closing near the low (CLV -0.788). This massive influx of supply overwhelms the bullish context and represents heavy selling. Although the quarterly context is bullish, this climactic down move suggests a significant reversal or major shakeout is underway from the recent high (41.29).

**Key Levels:** 41.29 (Climax High Resistance), 33.43 (Climax Low Support), 39.39 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry below 33.43 if supply persists. Long entry only after a successful low volume Test near 33.43.
- **Invalidation:** 39.39 (Above the open of the supply bar)
---
### BXP (NEUTRAL to BULLISH bias)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Climactic Action)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Context is BEARISH. The weekly sequence is classified as Stopping Volume being watched. The last weekly bar (2026-01-26) features exceptionally high volume (RelVol 1.98) on a moderately wide spread down, but the close (CLV 0.081) is slightly above the low, suggesting some buying absorbed the selling pressure. This massive volume spike near the lows (62.75) indicates professional interest/accumulation (Stopping Volume). This suggests a potential turning point, but requires follow-up confirmation.

**Key Levels:** 66.30 (Immediate Resistance), 62.75 (Stopping Volume Low/Support), 68.02 (Prior Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Successful Test of 62.75 on ultra-low volume, or a strong up-bar clearing 66.30.
- **Invalidation:** 62.75 (Break below the Stopping Volume low)
---
### CADE (BEARISH (Extreme Volatility))
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Climactic Selling

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Context is BULLISH, but both weekly and monthly sequences point to Supply Dominance. The last weekly bar (2026-01-26) is highly climactic: extreme volume (RelVol 7.4) on a wide spread down, closing well off the low (CLV -0.484). This institutional selling is massive, indicating a major shakeout or climax in the selling. Despite the CLV not being at the absolute low, the sheer magnitude of volume suggests Smart Money dumping. This usually precedes a significant test or bounce, but the current verdict remains bearish due to the overwhelming supply shown.

**Key Levels:** 43.58 (Immediate Resistance), 41.60 (Climax Low Support), 46.74 (Prior High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for volatility to stabilize and look for a Test or No Demand signature near 41.60.
- **Invalidation:** 43.58 (Above the high of the climax bar)
---
### CBRL (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result (Down)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Context is BULLISH, but the Monthly sequence indicates Supply Dominance. The last weekly bar (2026-01-26) has average volume (RelVol 1.05) on a wide spread down (3.88), but the close is near the high (CLV 0.118). This suggests that while price dropped, demand stepped in to absorb selling, resulting in a slightly positive close on the week despite the large range. The prior week was a sharp rejection (CLV -0.876). Current bar suggests indecision/absorption in a zone of monthly supply.

**Key Levels:** 31.83 (Immediate Resistance), 27.95 (Immediate Support), 36.89 (Monthly High Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Clear break above 31.83 on strong volume (Demand) or a close below 27.95 on supply.
- **Invalidation:** 31.83
---
### CBSH (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Context is BULLISH, but the Monthly sequence signals Supply Dominance. The last weekly bar (2026-01-26) is a narrow spread bar on high volume (RelVol 1.58), closing mid-range (CLV 0.248). High volume on a small range indicates absorption or distribution. Given the previous week's supply signal (CLV -0.85), this week suggests Smart Money is pausing/fighting at the 52.64 level. The bullish quarterly trend is being challenged by supply.

**Key Levels:** 53.29 (Immediate Resistance), 51.56 (Immediate Support), 56.06 (Prior High/Supply Zone)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 53.29 on strong volume (Demand) or below 51.56 on supply.
- **Invalidation:** 51.56
---
### CDE (BEARISH (Extreme Volatility))
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Extreme Selling Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Context is BULLISH, but the weekly sequence shows Supply Dominance and the Monthly sequence showed a Buying Climax. The last weekly bar (2026-01-26) shows extreme volume (RelVol 2.43) on a massive spread down (7.75), closing near the absolute low (CLV -0.891). This is a definitive Selling Climax or massive supply dump, completely reversing the prior weeks' strong rallies. The massive volume confirms institutional participation in the selling. This action invalidates the recent bullish surge.

**Key Levels:** 27.77 (Climax High Resistance), 20.02 (Climax Low Support), 23.25 (Prior Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry below 20.02 if sustained. Long entry only after a low volume test near 20.02.
- **Invalidation:** 27.77 (The recent high)
---
### CELC (NEUTRAL to BEARISH bias)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Effort No Result Down)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Context is BULLISH, but the Monthly sequence indicates Supply Dominance. The last weekly bar (2026-01-26) shows high volume (RelVol 1.22) on a wide spread up, yet the close is well off the high (CLV -0.75). This constitutes an Upthrust/Effort No Result Up. The price made a high of 120.31 but was swiftly rejected, leaving a long upper wick. This rejection on increasing volume suggests heavy supply absorption near the highs, indicating strong resistance and potential distribution.

**Key Levels:** 120.31 (Resistance/High), 107.86 (Immediate Support), 103.84 (Prior Swing Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below 107.86 on supply confirmation.
- **Invalidation:** 120.31 (Break above the recent high)
---
### CIVI (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Effort No Result (Down)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Context is BEARISH, and the weekly sequence indicates a Buying Climax. The last weekly bar (2026-01-26) shows extreme volume (RelVol 4.44) on a moderate spread up, closing slightly below mid-range (CLV -0.421). This massive volume spike with relatively little spread increase suggests Smart Money distributing their shares into strong buying demand. This is a classic Effort No Result Up (or Buying Climax confirmation). Given the bearish quarterly trend, the odds favor a downside break.

**Key Levels:** 29.20 (Climax High Resistance), 26.64 (Immediate Support), 25.37 (Prior Low Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 26.64 on supply confirmation.
- **Invalidation:** 29.20 (Break above the climax high)
---
### CMPO (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Supply Rejection/Effort No Result (Down)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Context is BULLISH, but the weekly sequence indicates Stopping Volume. The last weekly bar (2026-01-26) shows high volume (RelVol 1.47) on a moderate spread down, closing slightly below mid-range (CLV -0.433). This is a reversal from the strong demand bar two weeks prior. The high volume selling suggests supply entering the market following the rally to 26.50. This is Effort No Result Down, confirming that the initial bullish move has been met with distribution.

**Key Levels:** 25.32 (Immediate Resistance), 22.88 (Immediate Support), 26.50 (High of rally)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 22.88 on supply for bearish confirmation. Break above 25.32 on demand for bullish continuation.
- **Invalidation:** 22.88
---
### CNQ (NEUTRAL to BEARISH bias)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result (Up)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Context is BULLISH, but the weekly sequence indicates Stopping Volume is being watched. The last weekly bar (2026-01-26) shows high volume (RelVol 1.36) on a wide spread up, closing well off the high (CLV 0.171). This is Effort No Result Up, suggesting professional selling absorbed the demand near 38.32. This supply entering the market challenges the bullish trend, converting the high area into a distribution zone.

**Key Levels:** 38.32 (Resistance/Supply Zone), 35.64 (Immediate Support), 34.10 (Key Swing Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below 35.64 on supply confirmation.
- **Invalidation:** 38.32 (Above the high of the Effort No Result bar)
---
### CPNG (NEUTRAL to BULLISH bias)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax / Demand Absorption

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Context is BEARISH, and both sequences show Supply Dominance. However, the last weekly bar (2026-01-26) shows extreme volume (RelVol 2.93) on a wide spread, yet closes well off the low (CLV 0.327). This massive volume near the lows suggests institutional buying absorbing supply (Selling Climax). This volume spike, relative to prior weeks, indicates a potential turning point despite the prevailing bearish trend. Smart Money appears to be accumulating.

**Key Levels:** 20.97 (Immediate Resistance), 18.55 (Climax Low Support), 22.87 (Prior Swing Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Successful low volume Test near 18.55. Long entry requires clearing 20.97.
- **Invalidation:** 18.55 (Break below the Climax low)
---
### CRBG (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Demand Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Context is BEARISH, but the Monthly sequence indicates a Buying Climax. The last weekly bar (2026-01-26) has low volume (RelVol 0.75) on a narrow spread, closing near the high (CLV 0.399). This lack of major selling pressure and upward movement suggests underlying demand is sufficient to hold the price up without major effort. Given the recent tight trading range and monthly climax signal, this suggests a period of re-accumulation/consolidation before a potential break higher, despite the bearish quarterly context.

**Key Levels:** 31.21 (Immediate Resistance), 29.94 (Immediate Support), 32.63 (Monthly High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 31.21 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** 29.94 (Below the low of the consolidation zone)
---
### FCX (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Effort No Result (Down)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Context is BULLISH, but the weekly sequence shows Supply Dominance. The last weekly bar (2026-01-26) shows extreme volume (RelVol 2.04) on a very wide spread down, closing well off the low (CLV -0.708). This massive volume indicates strong institutional selling (Supply Dominance) that overwhelmed the market. Although the bullish quarterly context suggests this could be a major shakeout, the immediate signal is weakness. The prior weeks had strong up moves, making this a violent reversal/distribution event.

**Key Levels:** 69.44 (Climax High Resistance), 58.66 (Immediate Support), 63.42 (Prior Open/Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a low volume test of 58.66 for a long entry, or a short entry below 58.66 if supply persists.
- **Invalidation:** 69.44 (Above the high of the supply bar)
---
### FER (NEUTRAL to BEARISH bias)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result (Up)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Context is BULLISH, but the Monthly sequence indicates Supply Dominance. The last weekly bar (2026-01-26) shows high volume (RelVol 0.807) on a wide spread up, but the close is significantly off the high (CLV -0.305). This is a potential Upthrust or Effort No Result Up, suggesting professional selling absorbed the demand near 69.81. This is a sign of distribution at current highs, challenging the bullish quarterly context.

**Key Levels:** 69.81 (Resistance/Supply Zone), 67.02 (Immediate Support), 65.55 (Prior Swing Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below 67.02 on supply confirmation.
- **Invalidation:** 69.81 (Above the high of the supply bar)
---
### FFIN (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Context is BULLISH, but the weekly sequence indicates Supply Dominance. The last weekly bar (2026-01-26) shows extremely high volume (RelVol 2.24) on a wide spread down, closing near the low (CLV -0.502). This high volume selling suggests a significant supply influx. While the close is only mid-range, the sheer volume on the down move is concerning and confirms supply dominance, overriding the immediate bullish quarterly context.

**Key Levels:** 33.66 (Immediate Resistance), 31.21 (Immediate Support), 34.57 (Prior High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 31.21 on supply confirmation.
- **Invalidation:** 33.66 (Above the high of the supply bar)
---
### FFIV (NEUTRAL to BEARISH bias)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Effort No Result (Up)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Context is BULLISH, but the weekly sequence indicates a Buying Climax, and the Monthly sequence shows Stopping Volume. The last weekly bar (2026-01-26) shows extremely high volume (RelVol 1.83) on a massive spread up (42.13), but closes well off the high (CLV -0.346). This is a profound Effort No Result Up, confirming heavy distribution near 303.98. Smart Money is selling into the peak buying, aligning with the Buying Climax signal.

**Key Levels:** 303.98 (Climax High Resistance), 261.85 (Immediate Support), 267.41 (Prior Swing High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 261.85 on supply confirmation.
- **Invalidation:** 303.98 (Above the climax high)
---
### FHB (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Context is BULLISH, but the weekly sequence indicates Supply Dominance. The last weekly bar (2026-01-26) shows extremely high volume (RelVol 2.29) on a wide spread down, closing slightly below mid-range (CLV -0.552). This high volume selling suggests strong supply entering the market, overcoming the recent attempts to rally. This action challenges the bullish quarterly trend and confirms institutional selling.

**Key Levels:** 28.11 (Immediate Resistance), 26.10 (Immediate Support), 28.35 (Prior High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 26.10 on supply confirmation.
- **Invalidation:** 28.11 (Above the high of the supply bar)
---
### FIBK (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Context is BULLISH, but the Monthly sequence indicates a Buying Climax. The last weekly bar (2026-01-26) shows high volume (RelVol 1.29) on a wide spread down, closing near the low (CLV -0.940). This is strong supply confirmation following the recent rally attempt, suggesting the distribution phase is kicking in (aligned with the monthly Buying Climax). The market is displaying weakness.

**Key Levels:** 38.41 (Immediate Resistance), 35.38 (New Low Support), 38.78 (Prior High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 35.38 on supply confirmation.
- **Invalidation:** 38.41 (Above the high of the supply bar)
---
### FISV (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Effort No Result Down)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Context is BULLISH, but the Monthly sequence indicates Supply Dominance. The last weekly bar (2026-01-26) shows high volume (RelVol 1.06) on a wide spread down, closing slightly below mid-range (CLV -0.595). This represents supply dominance challenging the bullish trend. High volume on a down move confirms professional selling. Although the spread isn't massive, the movement is a clear rejection of prior weeks' strength.

**Key Levels:** 67.91 (Immediate Resistance), 62.67 (Immediate Support), 70.41 (Prior High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 62.67 on supply confirmation.
- **Invalidation:** 67.91 (Above the high of the supply bar)
---
### FRPT (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Demand Confirmation / Upthrust

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Context is BULLISH, and the Monthly sequence indicates Stopping Volume. The last weekly bar (2026-01-26) shows high volume (RelVol 1.41) on a wide spread down, closing significantly off the high (CLV -0.257). This follows a week of strong demand (CLV 0.697). The reversal on high volume suggests that either supply has met the demand (Upthrust) or a short-term shakeout is occurring before continuation. Given the context, this indicates a period of temporary distribution/indecision near the highs.

**Key Levels:** 73.19 (Upthrust/Resistance), 67.64 (Immediate Support), 72.28 (Prior Open)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 67.64 on supply confirmation.
- **Invalidation:** 73.19 (Above the Upthrust high)
---
### GKOS (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Effort No Result Down)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Context is BULLISH, but the Monthly sequence indicates a Buying Climax. The last weekly bar (2026-01-26) shows high volume (RelVol 0.96) on a wide spread down, closing significantly off the low (CLV -0.549). This high volume on a down move suggests supply entering, but the inability to close strongly near the low suggests some demand absorption. The prior week was also a rejection (CLV -0.712) after a massive rally. This zone is likely distribution/consolidation.

**Key Levels:** 128.84 (Immediate Resistance), 116.63 (Immediate Support), 130.23 (Prior High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 116.63 on supply, or a clear high volume up move past 128.84.
- **Invalidation:** 128.84
---
### GNTX (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Context is BULLISH, but the Monthly sequence indicates Supply Dominance. The last weekly bar (2026-01-26) shows high volume (RelVol 1.64) on a wide spread down, closing near the low (CLV -0.243). The high volume selling suggests supply entering the market, successfully pushing the price lower, confirming the monthly supply signal. The wide spread down on volume is a clear sign of weakness.

**Key Levels:** 24.16 (Immediate Resistance), 22.31 (Immediate Support), 24.92 (Monthly High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 22.31 on supply confirmation.
- **Invalidation:** 24.16 (Above the high of the supply bar)
---
### HBM (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Effort No Result (Down)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Context is BULLISH, but the weekly sequence indicates Supply Dominance. The last weekly bar (2026-01-26) shows extremely high volume (RelVol 1.81) on a wide spread down, closing well off the low (CLV -0.874). This massive supply influx following the previous week's rally (CLV 0.654) suggests heavy distribution near the highs (28.74). The market is being overwhelmed by sellers, challenging the bullish trend severely.

**Key Levels:** 28.74 (Resistance/Supply Zone), 23.34 (Immediate Support), 25.97 (Prior Open/Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 23.34 on supply confirmation.
- **Invalidation:** 28.74 (Above the high of the supply bar)
---
### HDB (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Possible Accumulation)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Weekly chart shows a sharp sell-off (Wk 2) on extreme volume (2.88 RelVol), followed by high volume (1.6 RelVol) on a narrow spread (Wk 5), closing slightly higher. This suggests professional money stepped in to halt the decline and absorb supply, which is a preliminary sign of accumulation after major weakness.

**Key Levels:** $33.00 (Recent Support/SC Low), $36.50 (Prior Distribution Level), $32.00 (Wk 5 Low Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Bullish confirmation above $33.50, especially if accompanied by a low-volume Test (No Supply).
- **Invalidation:** $31.90 (Below Wk 5 low)
---
### HPE (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Preliminary Stopping Volume / Weakness

**Smart Money Logic:**
Price declined sharply into Wk 3 low ($21.42). Wk 5 showed elevated volume on a tight spread near $21.52, suggesting absorption. However, the overall volume strength relative to the selling is only moderate (RelVol around 0.6-0.8), lacking the climax volume required for a strong reversal. We are monitoring the low area for a confirmed test.

**Key Levels:** $21.40 (Recent Low Support), $24.00 (Prior Support/Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Strong close above $22.50 on increasing volume, confirming absorption.
- **Invalidation:** $21.00 (Below recent lows)
---
### HPQ (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Accumulation Effort)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Wk 5 exhibits high relative volume (1.57) coupled with a narrow spread and a close in the upper half (CLV 0.388), occurring after several weeks of downward momentum. This suggests heavy selling was met and absorbed by professional buying interest near $19.00.

**Key Levels:** $18.94 (Wk 5 Low/Support), $20.40 (Immediate Resistance), $22.00 (Prior Support/Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Low volume Test of the Wk 5 low, or a strong push and close above $19.80.
- **Invalidation:** $18.80 (Violation of SC low)
---
### HRMY (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Sign of Weakness (SOW) / Distribution

**Smart Money Logic:**
After a sharp run-up in Wk 2, the stock failed to hold gains (Wk 3). Wk 5 shows a wide spread bar closing weakly on moderate volume, indicating selling pressure overcoming demand, potentially marking distribution activity at higher levels (near $38-$39).

**Key Levels:** $34.68 (Wk 3 Low Support), $38.00 (Recent Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $36.00 with confirmation of increased selling volume.
- **Invalidation:** $38.75 (Above Wk 2 high)
---
### HUM (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax (SC) / Capitulation

**Smart Money Logic:**
Wk 5 displayed extreme selling volume (3.41 RelVol) driving the price down dramatically (77.7 spread) to close near the absolute low ($191.38). This is institutional dumping/capitulation, which precedes a reversal if Smart Money steps in to absorb it subsequently.

**Key Levels:** $191.38 (SC Low), $265.00 (Prior Support), $285.60 (Recent High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A sharp rally followed by a low volume "Test" (No Supply) near the $200 level.
- **Invalidation:** $190.00 (Break below SC low)
---
### IMAX (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Supply Overcoming Demand after Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
Strong stopping volume in Wk 3 failed to initiate a sustained rally, immediately facing heavy selling in Wk 4. This indicates strong overhead resistance around $37.50. Wk 5 is consolidation near the low, suggesting indecision as Smart Money determines if the supply has been cleared.

**Key Levels:** $33.62 (Wk 3 SC Low), $37.50 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Strong push above $36.00 on increasing volume, confirming absorption.
- **Invalidation:** $33.50 (Break below recent support)
---
### INVH (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume followed by Re-accumulation

**Smart Money Logic:**
Extreme volume in Wk 2 marked a Selling Climax ($25.29), immediately reversed by a powerful close in Wk 3, confirming institutional interest. Wk 5 shows elevated volume attempting to breach resistance but closing flat/down, suggesting a final supply clearance effort near $27.30.

**Key Levels:** $25.29 (SC Low/Support), $27.70 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close above $27.70 or a confirmed low volume test near $26.50.
- **Invalidation:** $25.00 (Below SC low)
---
### ITT (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result Up / Supply Encountered

**Smart Money Logic:**
Wk 5 volume was high (1.25 RelVol) but the close was poor relative to the spread, indicating that Smart Money may be distributing or that strong overhead supply is present near the highs ($185.82). This follows a previous strong rebound (Wk 2).

**Key Levels:** $185.82 (Resistance), $178.08 (Wk 5 Low/Immediate Support), $172.72 (Wk 1 Low Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Clear break below $180.00 on high selling volume, confirming supply dominance.
- **Invalidation:** $186.00 (Above recent high)
---
### KDP (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Consolidation / Indecision

**Smart Money Logic:**
Price remains bound between $26.40 and $28.40. Wk 5 shows increased spread and volume but closes mid-range. This suggests ongoing conflict between buyers and sellers without a clear dominance signal yet, possibly marking a secondary phase in a larger pattern.

**Key Levels:** $26.40 (Support), $28.00 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Clear breakout above $28.00 on high volume for bullish, or breakdown below $26.40 for bearish confirmation.
- **Invalidation:** $26.30 (Breakout requirement)
---
### NET (BEARISH (Extreme momentum, pending immediate reversal confirmation))
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax / Extreme Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Wk 5 demonstrated a massive surge in selling volume (3.0 RelVol) across an enormous spread, closing near the absolute low ($175.07). This is institutional capitulation, confirming overwhelming supply. While it marks a short-term extreme low, the immediate pressure remains downward.

**Key Levels:** $175.07 (SC Low), $185.00 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Strong close above $180.00 on decreased volume, suggesting absorption.
- **Invalidation:** $175.00 (Break below SC low)
---
### OC (NEUTRAL (Shifting to Bearish))
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result Up / Supply Detected

**Smart Money Logic:**
Wk 5 volume was high (1.4 RelVol) and the spread was wide, but the close was significantly off the high, suggesting distribution by institutional traders around the $125.30 level. This is a clear warning sign of a potential reversal.

**Key Levels:** $125.30 (Resistance), $116.87 (Wk 5 Low/Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $118.00 on increasing selling volume.
- **Invalidation:** $125.40 (Above Wk 5 high)
---
### PB (NEUTRAL (Volatile bottom formation))
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax (SC) / Preliminary Accumulation

**Smart Money Logic:**
Wk 5 saw institutional dumping, leading to an extreme spread and high volume (2.56 RelVol). The close near the absolute low ($65.12) means Smart Money only managed to halt the decline, but didn't push a meaningful reversal. This SC sets the low for a potential base, but confirmation is pending.

**Key Levels:** $65.12 (SC Low/Support), $70.00 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Low volume Test of Supply near $65.50 or a strong close above $70.00.
- **Invalidation:** $65.00 (Break below SC low)
---
### PSN (NEUTRAL (Pending bearish confirmation))
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result Up / Supply Detected

**Smart Money Logic:**
Wk 5 reversed sharply from the high, closing in the lower half of the spread on high volume. This indicates institutional selling pressure is preventing upward progress and confirming overhead supply near $73.00, suggesting a reversal of the recent bounce.

**Key Levels:** $69.18 (Wk 5 Low/Support), $73.26 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Breakdown below $69.00 on increasing selling volume.
- **Invalidation:** $73.30 (Above Wk 5 high)
---
### PTGX (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Preliminary Demand / Stabilization

**Smart Money Logic:**
Wk 5 shows increased activity and volatility, managing a close in the upper half after bouncing off $77.69. This suggests demand is stepping in to stabilize the price, potentially setting up a phase of accumulation after the Wk 2 weakness.

**Key Levels:** $77.69 (Wk 5 Low/Support), $84.30 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Confirmed low volume test near $78.00, or strong close above $84.50.
- **Invalidation:** $77.00 (Below Wk 5 low)
---
### RARE (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Supply Encountered / Re-distribution

**Smart Money Logic:**
Despite sharp reversals (Wk 1, Wk 4), Wk 5 volume remains high (1.39 RelVol), yet the close is poor (-0.068 CLV), reversing from $25.00. This struggle confirms strong overhead supply preventing markup. The market is consolidating in a precarious position.

**Key Levels:** $23.26 (Immediate Support), $25.00 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $25.00 on ultra-high volume for bullish signal; breakdown below $23.00 for bearish signal.
- **Invalidation:** $25.00 (Resistance break required)
---
### RLI (NEUTRAL (High potential reversal))
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Preliminary Accumulation

**Smart Money Logic:**
Wk 5 volume was peak institutional activity (1.9 RelVol). The wide spread reversing to close high (CLV 0.196) suggests Smart Money absorbed heavy selling pressure near $56.90, halting the decline and creating a potential accumulation point.

**Key Levels:** $56.90 (Wk 5 Low/Support), $59.45 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Low volume test (No Supply) toward $57.50, or break above $60.00.
- **Invalidation:** $56.80 (Break below SC low)
---
### RYAAY (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last Weekly bar (2026-01-26) shows high relative volume (2.25x) on a wide bar that closes near the high (CLV 0.615). This occurred after a price drop, suggesting powerful absorption of supply (Stopping Volume). The current Quarterly trend is BULLISH, supporting the idea of accumulation/re-accumulation at these levels.

**Key Levels:** 66.75 (Previous Stopping Volume Low), 68.73 (Last Week Open/Recent Support), 73.75 (Near-term Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A subsequent Test bar on low volume, followed by a close above $71.96.
- **Invalidation:** $66.70 (Below the low of the 2026-01-12 accumulation attempt)
---
### RYN (NEUTRAL/BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
Both Monthly and Weekly charts detected a powerful move that ended in potential distribution (Monthly Buying Climax in Jan 2026, high volume, low CLV -0.20) followed by a potential Stopping Volume event. The last Weekly bar (2026-01-26) shows extremely high volume (4.29x) on a wide down bar, closing poorly (CLV -0.20), but this volume spikes usually mark the end of a Selling Climax phase. Given the Quarterly BULLISH TREND, this massive volume suggests Smart Money may be absorbing supply near the lows.

**Key Levels:** 21.89 (Last Week Low/Climax Support), 24.82 (Recent High/Supply), 21.36 (Monthly Low/Key Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A tight, low volume Test of the $21.90-$22.70 zone. Entry above $24.01.
- **Invalidation:** $21.35 (Break below Monthly Low indicates failure of stopping action)
---
### STAA (NEUTRAL/BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
Despite the Quarterly BEARISH TREND, the last Weekly bar (2026-01-26) is flagged as potential Stopping Volume. However, the volume (0.86x) is not exceptional, and the spread is narrow, closing poorly (CLV -0.42). While the price decline has slowed, the presence of high-volume Selling Climax in prior weeks (Jan 5: 2.72x volume) suggests a major absorption effort is ongoing. The current bar lacks confirmation of demand, indicating a lull or temporary test.

**Key Levels:** 18.66 (Last Week Low/Major Support), 19.66 (Minor Resistance), 24.26 (Climax High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Require a definitive Test bar or a large bullish bar on high volume to confirm accumulation. Entry above $19.66.
- **Invalidation:** $18.60 (Break below Selling Climax low)
---
### TFX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Weekly sequence flagged a Buying Climax. The strong bullish movement in early January (Jan 5) was quickly reversed by the subsequent high-volume down move on Jan 12 (CLV -0.93). The last week (2026-01-26) shows continuation supply with high volume (1.93x) and a poor close (CLV -0.29). Given the Quarterly BEARISH TREND, this structure is a potential Wyckoff re-distribution at depressed levels after the climax failed.

**Key Levels:** 106.98 (Resistance), 102.68 (Near-term Support), 127.49 (Climax High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry upon confirmed break below $102.68 on high volume.
- **Invalidation:** $107.06 (Above the high of the Jan 19 weak rally)
---
### UGI (NEUTRAL/BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Weekly chart shows a clear climax event (2026-01-26) with extreme volume (2.79x) and a wide spread, but the bar closes mid-range (CLV -0.029). This is classic Buying Climax/Effort No Result Up, signaling that significant supply entered the market at the top. This heavy supply often precedes a reversal, especially after a strong run up through the prior week.

**Key Levels:** 41.34 (Climax High/Supply), 38.95 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on a break and sustained close below $38.95.
- **Invalidation:** $41.35 (Above the climax high)
---
### USIG (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Trading in a very tight range, USIG's last Weekly bar shows high relative volume (1.23x) but a narrow spread, closing near the low (CLV -0.25). While flagged as Supply Dominance, the narrow range means this selling is contained. Given the tight consolidation, this action suggests either supply is testing the waters or a quiet re-distribution is occurring, though the move is small and not decisive. Quarterly trend is BULLISH.

**Key Levels:** 52.12 (Range Resistance), 51.65 (Range Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Requires a decisive break outside the $51.65 - $52.12 range on high volume.
- **Invalidation:** N/A (Holding range)
---
### VONG (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH, and the Monthly chart shows Stopping Volume followed by price weakness. The last Weekly bar (2026-01-26) displays high relative volume (1.78x) on a wide down spread, closing poorly (CLV -0.28). This action suggests that the recent accumulation effort (Monthly Stopping Volume) may have failed, or that supply is re-emerging strongly in this bear trend. The price is currently trading back in the lower portion of the recent range.

**Key Levels:** 122.50 (Resistance), 118.66 (Support/Test Zone)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on a break below $118.66, confirming breakdown from the consolidation.
- **Invalidation:** $123.25 (Above the high of the Dec 29 bar)
---
### WHR (NEUTRAL/BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last Weekly bar (2026-01-26) shows very high volume (2.58x) on a wide down spread, yet the close is mid-range (CLV 0.119). This is classic Stopping Volume / Selling Climax, suggesting Smart Money stepped in to absorb supply after the price dropped significantly from the prior week's high ($90.21). Given the Quarterly BULLISH TREND, this is likely accumulation/re-accumulation near a support area.

**Key Levels:** 72.55 (Climax Low/Support), 85.84 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A subsequent tight, low volume Test of the $72.55-$75.00 zone, or a close above $85.84.
- **Invalidation:** $71.72 (Below the monthly low of Jan)
---
### WRB (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH, but the last Weekly bar (2026-01-26) saw high volume (1.19x) on a wide spread up, closing in the upper half (CLV 0.45). This suggests a strong push by Demand after weeks of Supply Dominance. This may be a shakeout/Selling Climax, particularly given the rally closed near the high. However, the Monthly context still suggests supply (CLV 0.17). Needs confirmation.

**Key Levels:** 69.92 (Resistance), 65.02 (Selling Climax Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Bullish confirmation on a break above $69.92. Bearish continuation below $65.02.
- **Invalidation:** $65.01 (Break below the last week's low)
---
### ZM (NEUTRAL/BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last Weekly bar (2026-01-26) is flagged as a Buying Climax due to extreme volume (2.21x) and a wide spread, but the close is almost exactly mid-range (CLV 0.019). This high volume/mid-range close is indicative of heavy selling meeting demand at the top of the bar's move, but the close holds the price up. This suggests a potential temporary top or absorption of supply/demand battle. Given the Quarterly BULLISH TREND, this needs careful testing.

**Key Levels:** 97.58 (Climax High/Supply), 86.40 (Last Week Low/Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Bullish continuation requires a move above $97.58. Bearish reversal triggered below $86.40.
- **Invalidation:** $85.78 (Below prior week's close/demand confirmation)
