## 🚀 Ready for Entry
### ABVX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Potential Reversal

**Smart Money Logic:**
The asset is in a bearish quarterly trend. The weekly sequence shows a confirmed early Buying Climax. The initial large volume bars (RelVol 1.73, 1.93) led to downward movement and low CLV. The latest week (2026-02-02) shows a narrow spread, lower volume (RelVol 0.42), and a poor close (CLV -0.29), indicating lack of institutional demand following the previous supply exhaustion attempts. The monthly view confirms ongoing Supply Dominance (WATCH_FOR_TEST), suggesting the recent downward pressure is strong.

**Key Levels:** 130.13 (Climax High), 113.40 (Support Zone), 107.42 (Recent Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $107.40 on increasing volume, confirming markdown resumption.
- **Invalidation:** $125.86 (Break above consolidation zone high)
---
### AEVA (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Confirmed Markdown

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stock is in a confirmed bearish quarterly and monthly trend (Supply Dominance, Watch for Test). The sequence shows significant weakness: after a large up move on volume (2026-01-05), the next bars saw large spreads down, poor closes, and sustained high volume (RelVol 1.85, 1.23, 1.09). The latest bar (2026-02-02) is a wide spread down (Spread 2.37) with high volume (RelVol 0.69) and an extremely poor close (CLV -0.86). This is clear institutional selling pressure driving the price rapidly lower. No evidence of demand or stopping volume.

**Key Levels:** 15.81 (Immediate Resistance), 12.30 (Recent Support attempt), 11.18 (New Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $11.18 (new low) on high volume.
- **Invalidation:** $13.56 (Break above the previous week's high, suggesting minor absorption)
---
### AIQ (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result (Supply Confirmation)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is bearish. The monthly context is a Buying Climax (Watch for Test). The weekly action confirms massive supply has entered. The last two weeks saw wide spreads down (Spread 2.18 and 4.43) with high volume (RelVol 0.72 and 0.92) and extremely poor closes (CLV -0.80, -0.91). This is clear institutional selling/Effort No Result Downwards, failing to hold any gains and marking down sharply. The drop below $50 is significant, confirming the bearish control.

**Key Levels:** 52.72 (Immediate Supply/Resistance), 50.87 (Broken Support), 48.29 (New Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $48.29 on high volume.
- **Invalidation:** $52.72 (Break back into the upper range)
---
### AMBA (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The asset is in a bearish quarterly trend. Supply Dominance is present. The volume has been sustained above average (RelVol 1.81, 1.73, 0.82) while the price continues to move lower. The latest bar (2026-02-02) shows high volume (RelVol 0.82) on a wide spread down (Spread 6.98) and a very poor close (CLV -0.75). This is strong confirmation of supply pushing the price into markdown. There is no sign of absorption or stopping volume yet.

**Key Levels:** 65.57 (Immediate Resistance), 58.58 (New Low), 63.08 (Previous Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $58.58 on increased volume.
- **Invalidation:** $65.57 (Break above recent consolidation/high)
---
### AMKR (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result Downwards

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is bullish, but the monthly Buying Climax suggests distribution. The weekly charts show clear weakness after the initial Buying Climax on 2026-01-05 (RelVol 2.0). The last three weeks show heavy volume (RelVol 1.39, 1.03, 0.87) failing to hold gains, resulting in poor closes (CLV -0.66, -0.25, -0.77). The latest bar (2026-02-02) is a wide spread down on increased volume (RelVol 1.06) closing near the low (CLV -0.45, but price action marked down significantly from open). This is strong institutional selling/Effort No Result Downwards, indicating markdown is underway.

**Key Levels:** 54.20 (Supply Zone High), 46.77 (Prior Support Broken), 42.14 (New Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $42.14 on high volume.
- **Invalidation:** $49.99 (Invalidates the immediate bearish trend)
---
### APH (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Confirmed Markdown)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is bearish, and supply is dominating. Week 2026-01-26 saw extreme volume (RelVol 2.28) on a very wide spread, closing poorly (CLV -0.69). This is the hallmark of supply overwhelming demand. The following week (2026-02-02) confirmed this weakness, posting a wide spread down (Spread 23.03) on high volume (RelVol 1.37) and closing near the low (CLV -0.87). This confirms that Smart Money is selling aggressively, and markdown is accelerating.

**Key Levels:** 149.24 (Immediate Resistance), 140.00 (Broken Support), 126.21 (New Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $126.21 on sustained volume.
- **Invalidation:** $149.24 (Break above the recent high/supply pocket)

### APLS (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Watch for Test) / Rejection

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is bearish. The weekly sequence shows an initial strong up move (2026-01-05, CLV 0.91, RelVol 1.22), immediately followed by a devastating Supply bar (2026-01-12: wide spread down, CLV -0.94, RelVol 1.54). This is a strong Buying Climax/Upthrust. Although there was a brief recovery (2026-01-26, high volume, CLV 0.10), the last week (2026-02-02) showed a failure to rally, closing mid-range (CLV -0.22) on average volume. The structure is confirming distribution and markdown from the $27 area.

**Key Levels:** 24.10 (Immediate Resistance), 21.59 (Support), 19.76 (Climax Shakeout Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close below $21.59 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** $24.10 (Clear break above resistance, implying absorption failure)

### ARCC (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Watch for Test) / Markdown

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is bearish. The chart shows increasing volume and poor closes, confirming Supply Dominance. The last two bars (2026-01-26 and 2026-02-02) saw major volume spikes (RelVol 1.16, 1.84) on wide spreads down, closing near the absolute lows (CLV -0.95, -0.94). This is overwhelming institutional selling pressure pushing the price into a sharp markdown phase. The Smart Money is dumping positions.

**Key Levels:** 20.39 (Broken Support), 18.76 (New Low), 20.89 (Previous High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $18.76 on high volume.
- **Invalidation:** $19.89 (Break back above previous week's open)
---
### ARES (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Watch for Test) / Confirmed Markdown

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is bearish, and supply is dominating (Monthly Buying Climax suggests distribution at the top). Week 2026-01-19 was a Supply confirmation: wide spread down on high volume (RelVol 0.64, but volume is relatively high for this instrument), closing near the low (CLV -0.97). This confirms distribution. The final week (2026-02-02) is devastating: extreme volume (RelVol 2.23) on a massive spread down (Spread 31.16) closing near the low (CLV -0.84). This is clear, aggressive institutional panic selling/markdown initiation.

**Key Levels:** 155.74 (Broken Support), 119.46 (New Low/Target), 177.72 (Distribution High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $119.46 (new low) on continued high volume.
- **Invalidation:** $150.63 (Break back into the previous consolidation zone)
---
### ARWR (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Confirmed Early)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is bearish. Supply Dominance is confirmed early. After a strong up bar (2026-01-19) that failed to produce follow-through, the last week (2026-02-02) delivered a wide spread down (Spread 12.17) on high volume (RelVol 0.86) closing near the low (CLV -0.88). This is an immediate rejection of the prior demand attempt and a decisive sign that supply is taking control and pushing the price lower, continuing the markdown in line with the quarterly trend.

**Key Levels:** 76.11 (Immediate Supply/Resistance), 63.94 (New Low), 60.62 (Major Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $63.94 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** $72.00 (Break above prior supply high)
---
### AS (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Monthly) / Weakness

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is bearish. Monthly context flags Supply Dominance. The weekly chart confirms weakness. After a strong up bar attempt (2026-01-19, CLV 0.98), the last two bars show wide spreads down on sustained volume (RelVol 0.85, 0.93), closing poorly (CLV -0.78, -0.46). This is classic selling pressure overcoming minor rallies. The movement below $36.00 confirms the short-term bearish control.

**Key Levels:** 38.91 (Immediate Resistance), 34.82 (New Low), 36.36 (Broken Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $34.82 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** $38.21 (Break above recent high)
---
### AVAV (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Monthly) / Confirmed Markdown

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is bearish, supported by a monthly Buying Climax, indicating distribution. The weekly sequence shows devastating supply: after a massive up-move climax (2026-01-05, RelVol 2.09), the price has collapsed on successive high volume bars (RelVol 1.44, 1.21, 1.02), with extremely poor closes (CLV -0.82, -0.92, -0.89). This confirms severe institutional selling and markdown. The Smart Money is running for the exit.

**Key Levels:** 408.25 (Climax High), 276.76 (Broken Support), 234.00 (New Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $234.00 on sustained volume.
- **Invalidation:** $287.45 (Rally back into the previous week's range)
---
### AXTA (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Monthly) / Accumulation

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is bullish, and monthly confirms Stopping Volume has entered. The weekly action shows accumulation/Testing. Weeks 2026-01-12 and 2026-01-26 had high volume and narrow spreads (RelVol 1.35, 0.65), suggesting quiet buying. The last bar (2026-02-02) is a wide spread up on moderate volume (RelVol 0.85) closing strongly in the upper range (CLV 0.50). This suggests the institutional buying is beginning to succeed in pushing the price off the lows ($31.45). This appears to be a phase of accumulation completion.

**Key Levels:** 34.50 (Resistance/Supply Test), 33.79 (Immediate Support), 31.45 (Accumulation Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $34.50 on increasing volume, or a successful low volume Test near $33.30.
- **Invalidation:** $31.45 (Break below accumulation low)
---
### BABX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Monthly) / Rejection

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is bearish, reinforced by monthly Supply Dominance. The weekly sequence shows strong selling. After a rally attempt to $53.34 (2026-01-19, CLV 0.15), the last two weeks were clear rejection. Week 2026-01-26 saw high volume (RelVol 1.18) and a poor close (CLV -0.88), indicating supply entering. The last bar (2026-02-02) confirms markdown: wide spread down on moderate volume (RelVol 0.59) closing near the low (CLV -0.83). The institutional supply is pushing price lower effectively.

**Key Levels:** 46.61 (Immediate Resistance), 39.71 (New Low), 53.35 (Supply High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $39.71 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** $46.61 (Break above recent low high)
---
### BAH (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Monthly) / Markdown Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is bullish, but monthly flags a Buying Climax. The price action confirms distribution is complete. Week 2026-01-26 saw a sharp markdown (Spread 15.80) on high volume (RelVol 1.72) with a poor close (CLV -0.84), confirming major selling. The last bar (2026-02-02) followed through, showing a wide spread down on moderate volume (RelVol 0.79) closing near the low (CLV -0.05). This pattern strongly suggests markdown is now underway following the distribution phase around the $100 level.

**Key Levels:** 109.10 (Climax High), 87.20 (Support/Chop Zone), 81.15 (New Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $81.15 on high volume.
- **Invalidation:** $96.75 (Break back above previous supply zone)
---
### BANC (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Monthly Confirmed Strong) / Rejection

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is bullish, but the monthly chart flags a strong Buying Climax, indicating large distribution. Weekly action confirms this: weeks 01/19 and 01/26 showed moderate volume with poor closes (CLV -0.96, -0.16) failing to sustain the rally. The last week (2026-02-02) saw extremely high volume (RelVol 1.69) on a wide spread up, but the close was only mid-range (CLV 0.17). This indicates significant institutional selling (Effort No Result Upwards) absorbing the demand, suggesting the initial distribution is succeeding. The price struggles below the high $20.70 area.

**Key Levels:** 21.61 (Distribution High), 19.41 (Support), 20.70 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $19.41 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** $21.61 (Break above distribution high)
---
### BBIO (BEARISH (Supply Overcoming SV))
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Watch for Test) / Confirmed Markdown

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is bearish, and although Stopping Volume (SV) was indicated (2026-01-05 and 01/12), the subsequent action was negative. The last bar (2026-02-02) showed extreme weakness: a wide spread down (Spread 17.15) on high volume (RelVol 1.26), closing near the low (CLV -0.89). This indicates overwhelming supply that has crushed the potential SV zone. Institutional buyers have stepped aside, and the price is now in confirmed markdown.

**Key Levels:** 80.00 (Immediate Supply), 62.84 (New Low), 77.87 (Previous Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $62.84 on high volume.
- **Invalidation:** $77.27 (Break back above previous support zone)
---
### BBT (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Watch for Test) / Demand Surge

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is bullish, monthly flags a Buying Climax (suggesting institutional selling at the top). However, the last weekly bar (2026-02-02) showed extreme bullish action: wide spread up (Spread 3.02) on average volume (RelVol 1.05) closing near the absolute high (CLV 0.85). This is strong demand (or 'No Supply' following a period of weakness). The market has decisively pushed through prior resistance areas, suggesting the bullish trend is re-asserting control, overcoming the minor distribution signals.

**Key Levels:** 31.20 (New High), 28.18 (Immediate Support), 27.00 (Major Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Successful Test/No Supply bar near $30.00, or continued strength above $31.20.
- **Invalidation:** $28.18 (Close below the previous week's open, indicating Upthrust failure)
---
### BFH (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Watch for Test) / Demand Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is bullish. Weekly flags Stopping Volume, suggesting accumulation at lows. The price experienced a shakeout/rejection (2026-01-19, CLV -0.91) on low volume (RelVol 0.73), followed by high demand. The last bar (2026-02-02) is a wide spread up on high volume (RelVol 1.14) closing very strongly near the high (CLV 0.79). This demonstrates clear institutional buying and demand overcoming the supply that caused the prior shakeout. This is an accumulation signature leading to markup.

**Key Levels:** 77.79 (New High/Resistance), 71.80 (Support), 68.57 (Shakeout Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Successful No Supply test near $75, or a close above $77.79 on strength.
- **Invalidation:** $71.80 (Break below recent swing low)
---
### BKKT (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Monthly) / Confirmed Markdown

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is bearish, supported by a monthly Buying Climax. The weekly chart shows a complete collapse. After an Upthrust/Climax high in mid-January, the last two bars show wide spreads down on sustained volume (RelVol 0.52, 0.41) closing near the absolute lows (CLV -0.66, -0.99). The final bar is an extreme sign of weakness, closing on the low of the week on moderate volume, confirming aggressive markdown and abandonment by Smart Money.

**Key Levels:** 22.11 (Climax High), 9.89 (New Low/Target), 12.95 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $9.89 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** $13.40 (Break back into the previous consolidation zone)
---
### BKSY (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Monthly) / Confirmed Markdown

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is bullish, but monthly flags a Buying Climax. The recent weekly action confirms distribution and markdown. Week 2026-01-26 was a wide spread down (Spread 6.50) on high volume (RelVol 0.89) closing poorly (CLV -0.91). This is a strong sign of supply overwhelm. The last bar (2026-02-02) followed through, showing a wide spread down on sustained volume (RelVol 0.92), closing poorly (CLV -0.25). The structure suggests the $28-$30 area was a distribution zone, and the price is now in markdown towards lower accumulation levels.

**Key Levels:** 29.79 (Distribution High), 19.32 (New Low/Support), 23.82 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $19.32 on high volume.
- **Invalidation:** $23.82 (Break back above resistance)
---
### BRBR (BULLISH (Counter-trend potential))
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Monthly Confirmed Early) / Selling Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is bearish, but monthly flags confirmed Stopping Volume (SV). The weekly action shows a massive final shakeout. The last bar (2026-02-02) is an extreme wide spread down (Spread 5.60) on very high volume (RelVol 1.56) closing near the absolute low (CLV -0.98). This is a Selling Climax, often the final phase of markdown before a turnaround. The sheer volume suggests institutional capitulation or massive absorption.

**Key Levels:** 27.11 (Immediate Resistance), 19.45 (Selling Climax Low/Potential Spring), 22.70 (Previous Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Immediate bullish reversal bar (No Supply/Test) in the subsequent week, or a close above $22.70 on reduced volume.
- **Invalidation:** $19.45 (Sustained close below the climax low, confirming continued markdown)
---
### BROS (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Watch for Test) / Confirmed Markdown

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is bearish, and supply is active. Week 2026-01-26 saw a huge spike in volume (RelVol 2.48) on a wide spread down (Spread 9.72), closing poorly (CLV -0.74). This is a high-volume supply bar confirming institutional selling. The last bar (2026-02-02) followed through, showing a wide spread down on sustained volume (RelVol 1.23) and closing near the low (CLV -0.73). This confirms a strong continuation of markdown pressure.

**Key Levels:** 56.57 (Immediate Resistance), 51.77 (New Low), 63.95 (Supply High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $51.77 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** $56.57 (Break above recent high, suggesting absorption)
---
### BRZE (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Watch for Test) / Confirmed Markdown

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is bearish, and Supply Dominance is confirmed. The price has been marked down severely. Week 2026-01-26 saw high volume (RelVol 1.44) on a wide spread down, closing near the low (CLV -0.97). This confirms heavy supply. The last bar (2026-02-02) is also a wide spread down on high volume (RelVol 1.88) closing near the low (CLV -0.95). This is strong, consistent institutional selling pressure driving the price rapidly toward new lows, overwhelming any demand attempts.

**Key Levels:** 22.12 (Immediate Resistance), 17.62 (New Low), 26.14 (Previous Consolidation High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $17.62 on high volume.
- **Invalidation:** $22.12 (Break back into the previous consolidation zone)
---
### BSY (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Monthly) / Markdown Continuation

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is bearish, reinforced by monthly Supply Dominance. The price has been marked down consistently. The last two bars show clear supply pressure: Week 2026-01-26 saw high volume (RelVol 1.00) on a wide spread down, closing poorly (CLV -0.72). The last bar (2026-02-02) is also a wide spread down on high volume (RelVol 1.14) closing mid-range (CLV -0.52). Although volume is sustained, the consistent lower closes confirm supply is active and pushing the price towards the monthly low of $30.96.

**Key Levels:** 35.32 (Immediate Resistance), 30.96 (Monthly Low/Support), 39.07 (Previous High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $30.96 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** $35.32 (Break above the previous week's high)
---
### BWIN (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Monthly) / Confirmed Markdown

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is bearish, supported by monthly Supply Dominance. The chart shows ongoing, relentless institutional selling. Weeks 01/26 and 02/02 both show wide spreads down on high volume (RelVol 1.27, 1.23) closing near the lows (CLV -0.96, -0.93). This confirms aggressive markdown. There are no signs of absorption or demand attempts to halt the decline. Smart Money is strongly bearish.

**Key Levels:** 25.85 (Immediate Resistance), 18.63 (New Low/Target), 21.86 (Previous Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $18.63 on high volume.
- **Invalidation:** $22.91 (Break back into the previous consolidation zone)
---
### CALM (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is a wide down bar (Spread 6.28) closing near its low (CLV -0.65) on below-average volume (RelVol 0.82). This confirms prior SUPPLY_DOMINANCE detected by the algorithm. The lack of significant volume suggests smart money is letting the price fall after unloading, and there is insufficient demand to hold the price up, especially following the high CLV bar three weeks prior.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 89.48, Support: 83.20, 71.90

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below the recent low of 83.20 or a breakdown below 80.00 confirming supply strength.
- **Invalidation:** Above 89.48 (Recent High)
---
### CCOI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result (Negative)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is a wide down bar (Spread 3.24) closing near its low (CLV -0.85) on slightly below-average volume (RelVol 0.66). This is a strong sign of weakness, especially combined with the Monthly BUYING_CLIMAX context. The failure to maintain the previous rally peak (25.55) indicates that the previous upward effort has met strong supply. Price broke below the open and previous close, confirming weakness.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 25.55, Support: 22.31

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on break below 22.31.
- **Invalidation:** Above 25.55 (Last Swing High)
---
### CDE (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Climactic Action Follow-Through

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is a wide down bar (Spread 3.05) closing near its absolute low (CLV -0.98) on high volume (RelVol 1.24). This is a strong continuation of the distribution observed in the previous week (climax bar, 196M volume). The price failed to recover, and the high volume suggests smart money is actively unloading or supporting the continued decline. This is classic Supply Dominance following a Buying Climax.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 22.13, Support: 19.08

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on a break below 19.08.
- **Invalidation:** Above 22.13
---
### CDNS (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is an extremely wide down bar (Spread 33.59) closing near its low (CLV -0.56) on very high volume (RelVol 1.92). This suggests massive liquidation by institutions (Smart Money). Although the close is slightly off the low, the spread and volume confirm overwhelming supply and a major break down from previous trading ranges (328 high). This confirms the SUPPLY_DOMINANCE weekly status.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 296.34, Support: 262.75

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on break below 262.75, confirming continuation of selling pressure.
- **Invalidation:** Above 296.34 (Previous Weekly Close)
---
### CIVI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Effort No Result (Negative)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last bar shows high volume (RelVol 2.71), a wide spread, and a close in the lower half (CLV -0.42). This massive volume spike failed to produce a strong upward close, indicating a potential Buying Climax followed by immediate supply absorption. The quarterly trend is BULLISH, but this massive effort without a corresponding result often precedes a sharp correction or distribution phase. This confirms the BUYING_CLIMAX status.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 29.20, Support: 26.64

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on weakness below 27.00, confirming supply entry. Aggressive short below 26.64.
- **Invalidation:** Above 29.20 (Last High)
---
### CPNG (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Climactic Action

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is a wide down bar (Spread 3.60) closing near its low (CLV -0.97) on high volume (RelVol 1.50). This indicates climactic selling (panic), reinforcing the weekly and monthly SUPPLY_DOMINANCE status within a Bearish Quarterly Trend. Smart money is actively unloading, resulting in an aggressive downward move with high transactional volume and a poor close.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 20.34, Support: 16.74

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on break below 16.74.
- **Invalidation:** Above 20.34 (Weekly High)
---
### CRBG (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result (Negative)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is a wide down bar (Spread 1.88) closing near its low (CLV -0.80) on average volume (RelVol 0.73). This shows a clear effort to push lower with a poor closing result, suggesting Supply is entering the market. Given the monthly BUYING_CLIMAX context and BEARISH Quarterly trend, this weak action suggests distribution is continuing.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 31.49, Support: 29.61

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on break below 29.61.
- **Invalidation:** Above 31.49 (Weekly High)
---
### CSGP (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Climactic Action

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is an extremely wide down bar (Spread 12.08) closing near its absolute low (CLV -0.93) on high volume (RelVol 1.62). This suggests panic selling and climactic distribution, confirming the weekly and monthly SUPPLY_DOMINANCE status within a BEARISH Quarterly Trend. This is a severe weakness signal.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 62.67, Support: 50.59

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on break below 50.59.
- **Invalidation:** Above 62.67 (Weekly High)
---
### CTRA (NEUTRAL/BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is a wide up bar (Spread 3.21) closing strongly near its high (CLV 0.79) on very high volume (RelVol 2.24). This is a textbook Buying Climax signal, where high volume accompanies a price spike, indicating institutional selling into public enthusiasm. While the close is strong, the high volume suggests absorption/distribution is underway at this level, confirming the BUYING_CLIMAX status.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 30.64, Support: 27.43

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on failure to hold 30.00 and subsequent break below 27.43.
- **Invalidation:** Above 30.64 (Weekly High)
---
### DUOL (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Climactic Action Follow-Through

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is a wide down bar (Spread 24.13) closing near its low (CLV -0.84) on high volume (RelVol 1.77). This confirms severe continuation of the downtrend and liquidation, especially following the large volume breakdown the previous week. This is a clear sign of SUPPLY_DOMINANCE within a BEARISH quarterly trend. Institutions are liquidating positions aggressively.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 136.54, Support: 112.41

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on break below 112.41.
- **Invalidation:** Above 136.54 (Weekly High)
---
### EGO (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Climactic Action Follow-Through

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is a wide down bar (Spread 5.46) closing near its low (CLV -0.78) on very high volume (RelVol 1.91). This confirms the severe selling pressure initiated the prior week (wide down bar, high volume, CLV -0.87). Despite the Bullish Quarterly Context, the short-term action is dominated by overwhelming supply, suggesting a major top or significant correction is underway.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 41.86, Support: 36.40

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on break below 36.40.
- **Invalidation:** Above 41.86
---
### FISV (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Climactic Action

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is a wide down bar (Spread 5.96) closing near its low (CLV -0.78) on average volume (RelVol 0.93). This confirms the severe weakness and volume spikes seen in January, and reinforces the monthly SUPPLY_DOMINANCE status within a BEARISH Quarterly Trend. Institutions are not stepping up to defend prices, suggesting continuation lower.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 63.75, Support: 57.79

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on break below 57.79.
- **Invalidation:** Above 63.75 (Weekly High)
---
### GWRE (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Climactic Action

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is a wide down bar (Spread 20.30) closing near its low (CLV -0.59) on very high volume (RelVol 1.98). This suggests panic selling (Supply Dominance) following the price dropping below the January lows. The quarterly trend is BEARISH. The high volume reinforces the idea of institutional unloading/liquidation. This is a severe weakness signal.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 142.18, Support: 121.88

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on break below 121.88.
- **Invalidation:** Above 142.18 (Weekly High)
---
### HPE (NEUTRAL/BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is a medium spread up bar (Spread 1.94) closing above the midpoint (CLV 0.40) on high volume (RelVol 0.69). This positive action follows the monthly STOPPING_VOLUME confirmation. The buying effort, while not overwhelming, suggests demand is pushing the price higher and absorbing previous selling. This supports the idea that institutional accumulation began in January.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 23.29, Support: 21.35

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Long entry on break and hold above 23.29.
- **Invalidation:** Below 21.35 (Weekly Low)
---
### HPQ (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result (Negative)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is a wide down bar (Spread 2.23) closing below the midpoint (CLV -0.25) on very high volume (RelVol 1.69). This is a strong sign of weakness, where high transactional volume resulted in a wide bar that failed to hold its price. This reinforces the BEARISH Quarterly Trend and the monthly SUPPLY_DOMINANCE status, indicating sustained institutional selling.

### IONQ (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax Follow-Through / Severe Weakness

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is an extremely wide down bar (Spread 10.74) closing near its low (CLV -0.91) on average volume (RelVol 0.87). This confirms the aggressive selling pressure established the prior week (Climactic Action in the Monthly context). The closing position indicates absolute control by supply, leading to a break down below all recent support levels. The previous support zone around 38-40 has failed.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 40.73, Support: 29.99

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on break below 29.99.
- **Invalidation:** Above 40.73
---
### IONX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Climactic Action

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is an extremely wide down bar (Spread 7.98) closing near its low (CLV -0.91) on high volume (RelVol 1.76). This is absolute liquidation/panic selling, reinforcing the BEARISH Quarterly Trend and the SUPPLY_DOMINANCE weekly status. Price has broken major lows, indicating strong institutional selling pressure.

### IOT (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Climactic Action

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is a wide down bar (Spread 4.53) closing near its low (CLV -0.61) on very high volume (RelVol 2.05). This confirms the SUPPLY_DOMINANCE signal and indicates heavy selling pressure, possibly climactic. The price has broken down through multiple support levels. The high volume confirms institutional participation in the selling.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 27.91, Support: 23.38

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on break below 23.38.
- **Invalidation:** Above 27.91 (Weekly High)
---
### IQV (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Climactic Action

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is an extremely wide down bar (Spread 57.30) closing near its low (CLV -0.83) on very high volume (RelVol 1.85). This is a massive move, indicative of panic selling and distribution (Climactic Action). The prior three weeks showed consistent weakness, confirming institutional liquidation. This reinforces the BEARISH Quarterly Trend and the SUPPLY_DOMINANCE status.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 233.48, Support: 176.18

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on break below 176.18.
- **Invalidation:** Above 233.48 (Weekly High)
---
### IREN (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Climactic Action

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is a very wide down bar (Spread 16.82) closing near its low (CLV -0.89) on high volume (RelVol 1.02). This signals heavy institutional selling, confirming the SUPPLY_DOMINANCE status. Price broke sharply below previous support levels (around 51) and failed to find demand. The monthly context is also weak, indicating significant distribution.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 55.72, Support: 38.90

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on break below 38.90.
- **Invalidation:** Above 55.72 (Weekly High)
---
### ITT (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort to Rise

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is a very wide up bar (Spread 24.39) closing near its high (CLV 0.69) on high volume (RelVol 1.65). This is a sign of strong, aggressive demand, suggesting Smart Money entered with force, overcoming any short-term supply and potentially reversing the recent monthly SUPPLY_DOMINANCE trend. The price move is convincing.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 205.71, Support: 181.32

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Long entry on continuation above 205.71.
- **Invalidation:** Below 181.32 (Weekly Low)
---
### KDP (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort to Rise / Absorption

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is a medium spread up bar (Spread 1.49) closing above the midpoint (CLV 0.08) on low volume (RelVol 0.51). This suggests demand is easily advancing the price without significant opposition. The bar managed to close higher despite the Monthly BUYING_CLIMAX context, suggesting accumulation is continuing quietly in the BULLISH Quarterly Trend.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 28.69, Support: 27.20

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Long entry on break above 28.69.
- **Invalidation:** Below 27.20
---
### KKR (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Climactic Action

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is an extremely wide down bar (Spread 18.71) closing near its low (CLV -0.80) on very high volume (RelVol 2.26). This is strong confirmation of institutional liquidation (Supply Dominance) and panic selling. The price broke sharply below previous significant lows (113.38). This severe weakness suggests a deep correction is underway in this BEARISH Quarterly Trend.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 116.08, Support: 97.37

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on break below 97.37.
- **Invalidation:** Above 116.08 (Weekly High)
---
### KVYO (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is a wide down bar (Spread 4.76) closing near its low (CLV -0.92) on high volume (RelVol 1.00). This reinforces the SUPPLY_DOMINANCE signal from the monthly chart. Despite the 'Stopping Volume' detection (likely from the wide range), the very weak close on high volume indicates that supply is still entirely in control and aggressively driving the price lower, confirming liquidation.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 23.43, Support: 18.66

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on break below 18.66.
- **Invalidation:** Above 23.43 (Weekly High)
---
### MCO (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BEARISH. The weekly chart confirms strong selling pressure. The week of 2026-02-02 shows a massive downside movement (Spread 78.57) on huge relative volume (RelVol 2.14). The close is near the low (CLV -0.61), indicating overwhelming supply. This bar is a strong sign of Supply Dominance and confirms the continued bearish trend. Smart Money is aggressively selling, likely trapping weak buyers who entered around $500.

**Key Levels:** $546.88 (Resistance), $442.70 (Recent Low), $457.70 (Last Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $442.70 (confirming further markdown)
- **Invalidation:** $528.73 (Above previous week's high, implying weakness was absorbed)
---
### MNDY (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH. The weekly chart shows a continuous markdown phase. The last two weeks (2026-01-26 and 2026-02-02) exhibit wide-spread down bars, closing near their lows (CLV -0.89 and -0.97) on high volume (RelVol 1.14 and 2.01). The huge volume surge in the final week confirms aggressive institutional selling (Supply Dominance), driving the price sharply lower toward $94. This is consistent with Smart Money liquidating positions and marking the price down sharply.

**Key Levels:** $131.31 (Recent Supply), $94.27 (New Low Support), $94.59 (Last Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $94.27 (continuation of markdown)
- **Invalidation:** $117.25 (High of the distribution bar)
---
### MSFU (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BEARISH. The weekly chart shows extreme supply saturation. The week of 2026-01-26 featured massive volume (RelVol 5.78) and a huge spread, closing near the low (CLV -0.68). This represents a clear mark-down phase and institutional liquidation. The subsequent week (2026-02-02) is also a wide-spread down bar on high volume (RelVol 2.90) closing at the absolute low (CLV -0.93), confirming persistent Supply Dominance. This is a very weak chart signaling continuation to the downside.

**Key Levels:** $40.96 (Resistance), $26.50 (New Low Support), $26.68 (Last Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $26.50 (continuation of aggressive selling)
- **Invalidation:** $32.05 (High of last down wave)
---
### NET (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BEARISH. The week of 2026-01-26 showed ultra-high volume (RelVol 2.78) with a massive spread, but the bar closed near the low (CLV -0.89). This looks like a failed Buying Climax followed immediately by aggressive selling, confirming major supply entry (Effort No Result Down). The following week (2026-02-02) continues the downward momentum on high volume (RelVol 1.75), closing at the absolute low (CLV -0.91). This confirms Supply Dominance and a strong mark-down phase is in effect.

**Key Levels:** $218.22 (Failed Rally High), $162.01 (New Low Support), $163.05 (Last Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $162.01 (continuation of markdown)
- **Invalidation:** $185.22 (High of last supply bar)
---
### OC (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort to Rise (Confirmed)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BULLISH, and the latest monthly bar suggests Stopping Volume. The latest weekly bar (2026-02-02) is highly bullish: wide spread up bar, high volume (RelVol 1.10), closing near the high (CLV 0.66). This strongly confirms demand and is an 'Effort to Rise' that resulted in a powerful close. This indicates Smart Money is aggressively buying and marking up the price, overcoming the slight weakness seen in the prior week (2026-01-26).

**Key Levels:** $134.86 (New High), $119.16 (Support from breakout), $132.23 (Last Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Continuation move above $134.86 or bullish retest of $125.30
- **Invalidation:** $119.16 (Break below suggests failed breakout)
---
### OTIS (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Absorption / Effort to Rise

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BULLISH. The week of 2026-01-26 showed heavy selling (RelVol 2.10, wide down bar, CLV -0.62). However, the latest bar (2026-02-02) immediately countered this. It is a wide spread up bar on high volume (RelVol 1.46) closing near the absolute high (CLV 0.86). This aggressive reversal, known as Supply Absorption or successful Effort to Rise, shows Smart Money immediately stepped in to reverse the markdown attempt. This is very bullish behavior in a bullish quarterly trend.

**Key Levels:** $91.68 (New High), $84.00 (Test Low/Support), $91.24 (Last Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $91.68
- **Invalidation:** $85.28 (Below the latest buying activity)
---
### PB (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Demand Return

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BULLISH. The week of 2026-01-26 was a strong sell-off (RelVol 2.38, wide down bar) that pierced prior support ($71.04) and was initially deemed Stopping Volume. The latest bar (2026-02-02) is a strong positive follow-through: wide spread up bar, high volume (RelVol 1.44), closing strongly near the high (CLV 0.64). This aggressive rebound confirms Smart Money bought heavily at the low ($68.06), rejecting the markdown. This is highly bullish behavior indicating strength returning to the rally.

**Key Levels:** $74.15 (New High), $68.07 (Accumulation Low), $73.06 (Last Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $74.15, or continuation from current levels
- **Invalidation:** $68.07 (Violation of stopping volume low)
---
### PGY (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BEARISH, and the monthly sequence is 'WATCH_FOR_TEST' of Supply Dominance. The weekly chart shows continuous weakness. The latest bar (2026-02-02) is a wide spread down bar on moderate volume (RelVol 0.98), closing at the absolute low (CLV -0.94). This is the lowest close in the sequence, confirming persistent selling pressure and lack of demand. The prior bar (2026-01-26) also showed strong downside momentum. This confirms the markdown is still aggressively underway.

**Key Levels:** $22.29 (Resistance), $16.55 (New Low Support), $16.65 (Last Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $16.55 (continuation of mark-down)
- **Invalidation:** $19.24 (Above the open of the last down bar)
---
### PLTU (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BEARISH. The weekly chart confirms extreme weakness. The week of 2026-01-26 showed high volume (RelVol 1.11) with a massive wide down bar, closing near the low (CLV -0.88). The latest bar (2026-02-02) is even worse: an ultra-wide spread down bar on huge volume (RelVol 2.36), closing almost at the low (CLV -0.92). This is a dramatic confirmation of Supply Dominance and an aggressive markdown phase by Smart Money. No demand presence.

**Key Levels:** $66.50 (Resistance), $36.26 (New Low Support), $37.23 (Last Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $36.26 (continuation of aggressive selling)
- **Invalidation:** $51.62 (Above the open of the last supply bar)
---
### PRU (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BEARISH. The week of 2026-01-26 showed a powerful up bar on high volume closing near the high (CLV 0.98), which could have been a Test or bullish absorption. However, the latest bar (2026-02-02) completely negated this bullish signal. It is an extremely wide spread down bar on huge volume (RelVol 2.07), closing near the absolute low (CLV -0.85). This is a classic confirmation of Supply Dominance, suggesting the prior week's strength was merely a failed rally/trap. Smart Money is aggressively selling.

**Key Levels:** $112.49 (Resistance), $98.80 (New Low Support), $99.82 (Last Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $98.80 (continuation of mark-down)
- **Invalidation:** $112.49 (High of the distribution bar)
---
### PYPL (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Climax)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BEARISH. The latest weekly bar (2026-02-02) is highly significant: ultra-high volume (RelVol 3.06) on a massive spread down, closing near the low (CLV -0.85). This is a Supply Climax, potentially marking extreme institutional selling. While climactic volume can sometimes signal the end of a move, the low close and overwhelming momentum strongly confirm Smart Money is aggressively marking down the price. In a BEARISH quarterly context, this usually signals further downside after a brief pause/retest.

**Key Levels:** $53.44 (Resistance), $38.88 (New Low), $39.90 (Last Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $38.88 (confirming climax failure) or a weak test back towards $45.
- **Invalidation:** $53.44 (Above climax high)
---
### QQQI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Effort No Result Down

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BEARISH, and the monthly sequence suggests a Buying Climax. The latest weekly bar (2026-02-02) shows high volume (RelVol 1.48) with a wide down spread, closing near the low (CLV -0.85). This is an 'Effort No Result Down' following several weeks of sideways/weak upward movement. The high volume and low close confirms strong selling pressure entering the market, overwhelming any existing demand. Smart Money is distributing.

**Key Levels:** $54.67 (Resistance), $51.83 (New Low Support), $52.02 (Last Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $51.83 (confirmation of markdown)
- **Invalidation:** $54.35 (Above the high of the distribution bar)
---
### RF (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort to Rise

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BULLISH, although the monthly sequence suggests 'Confirmed Early' Supply Dominance. The weekly price action is strongly bullish. The last bar (2026-02-02) is a wide spread up bar on moderate volume (RelVol 0.68), closing near the high (CLV 0.72). This is a strong Effort to Rise, overcoming the prior week's weakness (2026-01-26 high volume absorption). The high close and moderate volume suggest efficient mark-up, indicating demand is strongly present and Smart Money is in control.

**Key Levels:** $30.84 (New High), $28.36 (Support), $30.50 (Last Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Continuation move above $30.84
- **Invalidation:** $28.36 (Break below suggests failure)
---
### RGLD (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BULLISH, but recent price action suggests strong distribution. The week of 2026-01-26 showed ultra-wide spread down on high volume (RelVol 1.12), closing near the low (CLV -0.80). This is a major Supply Dominance/Distribution signal, overwhelming the prior strength. The latest bar (2026-02-02) is a wide down bar on moderate volume (RelVol 0.80), closing near the absolute low (CLV -0.96), confirming the markdown phase is active. Smart Money is aggressively selling off recent gains.

**Key Levels:** $306.25 (Distribution High), $253.20 (New Low Support), $253.63 (Last Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $253.20 (continuation of markdown)
- **Invalidation:** $275.66 (Above high of last supply bar)
---
### RGTI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BEARISH, and the monthly sequence suggests a Buying Climax that failed. The weekly action confirms Supply Dominance. The last two bars (2026-01-26 and 2026-02-02) are wide spread down bars, closing near the lows (CLV -0.82 and -0.91). While volume is moderate (RelVol 0.48, 0.42), the persistence of the low closes confirms sellers are in firm control, driving the price into new lows. This suggests continuation of the bearish trend.

**Key Levels:** $23.78 (Resistance), $14.83 (New Low Support), $14.98 (Last Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $14.83 (confirmation of markdown)
- **Invalidation:** $18.38 (Above the last supply bar's high)
---
### RLI (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Demand Absorption

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BEARISH, but the weekly action shows a powerful reversal against the trend. The last bar (2026-02-02) is a wide spread up bar on moderate volume (RelVol 0.79), closing strongly near the high (CLV 0.64). This is a strong sign of demand entering the market and absorbing previous supply (2026-01-26 high volume bar). Given the monthly context suggests confirmed early Supply Dominance, this strong demand signal warrants attention, suggesting a potential short-term reversal or accumulation phase.

**Key Levels:** $62.77 (New High), $58.15 (Support), $61.96 (Last Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $62.77 on confirming volume
- **Invalidation:** $58.15 (Violation of recent demand low)
---
### SA (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BEARISH, and the monthly sequence is 'WATCH_FOR_TEST' of Supply Dominance. The week of 2026-01-26 featured a massive down bar on high volume (RelVol 1.46), closing near the low (CLV -0.97), clearly confirming Supply Dominance. The latest bar (2026-02-02) is a moderate spread down bar on moderate volume (RelVol 0.85), closing off the low (CLV -0.58). While volume moderated, the consistent downside pressure and low close confirm the market is in a markdown phase. The prior massive supply bar needs testing or absorption before reversal.

**Key Levels:** $37.99 (Distribution High), $27.41 (New Low Support), $28.10 (Last Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $27.41 (continuation of markdown)
- **Invalidation:** $30.75 (Above high of last supply bar)
---
### SARO (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the weekly action is dominated by supply. The last two weeks saw huge selling volume (RelVol 4.29 and 1.68). The week of 2026-01-26 was a wide down bar on extreme volume, closing near the low (CLV -0.91). The latest bar (2026-02-02) is a moderate spread down bar on high volume, closing off the low (CLV -0.31). This confirms a sharp distribution phase is underway, overwhelming the bullish quarterly context. The volume suggests Smart Money is actively liquidating positions into any strength.

**Key Levels:** $33.46 (Resistance), $28.63 (New Low Support), $29.51 (Last Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $28.63 (confirming markdown continuation)
- **Invalidation:** $31.19 (Above high of last supply bar)
---
### SATS (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BEARISH, and the monthly sequence suggests a Buying Climax. The week of 2026-01-26 showed ultra-high volume (RelVol 1.78) and a huge spread, but the price closed near the low (CLV -0.67), suggesting a failed rally and significant institutional selling. The latest bar (2026-02-02) is another wide spread down bar on high volume (RelVol 1.01), closing at the absolute low (CLV -0.94). This confirms Supply Dominance and an aggressive markdown phase. Smart Money is aggressively distributing.

**Key Levels:** $131.94 (Distribution High), $106.60 (New Low Support), $107.02 (Last Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $106.60 (continuation of mark-down)

---
### SONY (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BEARISH. The weekly chart shows consistent weakness, confirmed by the latest bar (2026-02-02). This bar is a wide spread down bar on high volume (RelVol 1.63), closing near the absolute low (CLV -0.89). This is a strong indicator of Supply Dominance and Smart Money selling. The sequence of low closes on high volume over the past month clearly shows persistent markdown.

**Key Levels:** $23.13 (Resistance), $21.17 (New Low Support), $21.24 (Last Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $21.17 (continuation of markdown)
- **Invalidation:** $22.37 (Above high of last supply bar)
---
### SPOT (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BEARISH. The chart shows extreme selling pressure. The latest bar (2026-02-02) is a massive spread down bar (107.28) on huge volume (RelVol 2.08). The close is near the low (CLV -0.85). This is a Supply Climax, confirming institutional panic selling and market capitulation. While climaxes often precede reversals, the immediate price action confirms immense weakness. Given the bearish quarterly context, we anticipate a small reaction rally (test) followed by continuation down, unless accumulation is confirmed.

**Key Levels:** $512.28 (Resistance), $405.00 (New Low / Climax Low), $412.75 (Last Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $405.00 (confirming climax failure)
- **Invalidation:** $512.28 (Above climax high)
---
### STAA (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Confirmed)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BEARISH, and the weekly sequence is confirmed 'STOPPING_VOLUME' at an early stage. However, the latest bar (2026-02-02) is a down bar on moderate volume (RelVol 0.84), closing near the absolute low (CLV -0.87). This negates the earlier stopping volume signal, as the price continues to be marked down aggressively toward new lows. This confirms persistent Supply Dominance, suggesting the bear trend is continuing without effective accumulation.

**Key Levels:** $19.66 (Resistance), $16.94 (New Low Support), $17.07 (Last Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $16.94 (continuation of mark-down)
- **Invalidation:** $19.00 (Above high of last supply bar)
---
### TXT (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort to Rise (Successful)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BULLISH. The week of 2026-01-26 showed high volume selling (RelVol 2.08) resulting in a weak close (CLV -0.34). However, the latest bar (2026-02-02) immediately countered this. It is a wide spread up bar on high volume (RelVol 1.40), closing near the absolute high (CLV 0.97). This strong recovery and close is a classic sign of demand asserting dominance ('Effort to Rise'), overcoming the prior week's supply surge. Smart Money is aggressively buying and marking up the price.

**Key Levels:** $92.93 (New High), $86.36 (Support), $92.85 (Last Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Continuation move above $92.93
- **Invalidation:** $86.36 (Low of the last demand wave)
---
### UGI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the weekly sequence suggests a Buying Climax. The week of 2026-01-26 featured ultra-high volume (RelVol 2.19) and a wide spread, but the close was well off the high (CLV -0.02), indicating heavy supply entry (BC). The latest bar (2026-02-02) confirmed this supply: a wide spread down bar on moderate volume (RelVol 0.93), closing near the low (CLV -0.82). This confirms Smart Money distribution and the start of a markdown phase following the Buying Climax.

**Key Levels:** $41.34 (BC High), $37.52 (Support), $37.83 (Last Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $37.52 (confirming markdown continuation)
- **Invalidation:** $40.98 (Above the high of the last supply bar)
---
### UNH (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BEARISH. The week of 2026-01-26 showed massive selling volume (RelVol 2.97) on a huge down bar, closing near the low (CLV -0.82). This is strong Supply Dominance. The latest bar (2026-02-02) is a wide down bar on high volume (RelVol 1.09), closing near the low (CLV -0.81). This confirms the aggressive mark-down is continuing, breaking below key accumulation areas established earlier in January. Smart Money is firmly in distribution/selling mode.

**Key Levels:** $290.40 (Resistance), $266.31 (New Low Support), $268.55 (Last Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $266.31 (continuation of markdown)
- **Invalidation:** $290.40 (Above the high of the distribution bar)

### USIG (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Absorption / Effort to Rise

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BULLISH. Despite the weekly sequence flagging Supply Dominance, the price action is remarkably tight. The last bar (2026-02-02) is an up bar on high volume (RelVol 1.11), closing near the absolute high (CLV 0.85). In this highly consolidated range, the strong close on high volume indicates successful demand absorption and Smart Money pushing the price up efficiently. This suggests continuation of the bullish quarterly trend is likely, overcoming the minor supply pressures seen recently.

**Key Levels:** $51.91 (New High), $51.63 (Support), $51.89 (Last Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $51.91 (continuation of mark-up)
- **Invalidation:** $51.63 (Violation of support)
---
### VLTO (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BEARISH. The latest weekly bar (2026-02-02) is a very wide spread down bar on high volume (RelVol 1.84), closing near the low (CLV -0.63). This confirms Supply Dominance and an active markdown phase, breaking below previous weeks' support levels. The high volume selling indicates Smart Money is participating heavily on the downside. The overall context suggests bearish continuation.

**Key Levels:** $102.68 (Resistance), $88.40 (New Low Support), $90.79 (Last Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $88.40 (continuation of markdown)
- **Invalidation:** $101.50 (Above high of last supply bar)
---
### WHR (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Immediate Rally / Sign of Strength (SOS)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Last week's Stopping Volume ($72.55 low) indicated heavy absorption. This week saw a strong recovery rally on above-average volume (RelVol 1.10), closing in the upper half of the wide spread. This strong bounce off the shakeout low confirms that demand has immediately stepped in, neutralizing the prior supply and signaling an intended markup phase within the bullish quarterly context.

**Key Levels:** $88.85 (Supply/Recent High), $77.61 (Demand Low), $72.55 (Stopping Volume Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Buy on confirmation above $85.84 (prior high area) or on a test pullback towards the $83-$84 zone.
- **Invalidation:** Close below $77.61 (Low of the strong rally bar).
---
### WRB (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply / Clear Strength

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stock achieved a strong close near the high ($71.29) following a period of consolidation. Crucially, this strong move occurred on significantly low volume (RelVol 0.61). This VSA signature indicates that supply has been successfully absorbed and there is minimal overhead resistance remaining (No Supply). This setup suggests the market is ready for a strong markup.

**Key Levels:** $71.59 (Resistance/Breakout Level), $68.50 (Test Zone), $67.25 (Key Demand Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Buy on confirmation above $71.59 or a successful test of demand near the $68.50 open price.
- **Invalidation:** Close below $67.25.
---
## 👀 Watch/Monitoring
### ABT (BULLISH (Counter-trend potential))
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is bearish, but the recent weekly sequence shows a massive spike in volume (2026-01-19, RelVol 2.57) on a wide spread down and a bearish close (Supply Dominance). The following two weeks saw similar high volume (RelVol ~2.37, ~1.44) but the spread narrowed significantly and the price closed near the mid-point or slightly lower (CLV 0.57 and 0.19). This indicates absorption of supply or a VSA 'Test' of the selling pressure. The high volume selling appears to be slowing down, suggesting a potential change of character or accumulation phase beginning near the 105-107 level.

**Key Levels:** 105.78 (Recent Low/Potential Accumulation Zone), 121.00 (Previous Support/Resistance), 125.76 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close above $111.00 on reducing volume, or a clear Spring action near $105.78.
- **Invalidation:** $105.00 (Break of recent low on high volume)
---
### ACLX (NEUTRAL/WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Effort to Rise (No immediate Climax/Stopping Volume)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is bullish. The monthly context indicates supply dominance (Watch for Test), suggesting distribution may be occurring at higher levels. The last three weeks show varying action: a strong up bar (CLV 0.65), a wide-spread down bar on high volume (CLV -0.67), and the latest bar is a wide spread down (Spread 4.73) with decreasing volume (RelVol 0.71) and a poor close (CLV -0.81). This shows weakness on the last bar, but volume isn't critically high yet to confirm Supply. Current action suggests weakness is entering the market, testing the bullish quarterly trend.

**Key Levels:** 76.50 (Recent High/Supply Zone), 66.00 (Immediate Support), 60.35 (Potential Re-accumulation Zone)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Clear break above $71.25 on high volume (Demand), or sustained close below $66.00 (Supply confirmation).
- **Invalidation:** $76.50 (If initiating short) / $60.00 (If initiating long)
---
### ACWX (BEARISH (Early Warning))
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is bullish, but the weekly setup is a Buying Climax (Watch for Test). The last three weeks show reduced relative volume but narrowing spreads. The latest bar (2026-02-02) has a moderate spread and a very poor close (CLV -0.88) on moderate volume (RelVol 1.25). This is classic weakness: price failed to hold gains despite the bullish context. Smart money appears to be selling into the strength, evidenced by the poor close and high CLV rejection last week (2026-01-26, CLV -0.68).

**Key Levels:** 72.33 (Recent High/Climax), 70.30 (Immediate Support), 68.30 (Key Previous Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close below $70.30 on increasing volume (Breakdown).
- **Invalidation:** $72.33 (Break above climax high)
---
### AGIO (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Monthly) / Weakness (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Monthly context suggests Stopping Volume is entering the market, but the weekly action is highly bearish. The last three bars show consecutive wide spreads down (CLV -0.67, -0.89), suggesting strong supply pressure. The latest bar (2026-02-02) closed near the low on moderate volume (RelVol 0.62), confirming the presence of supply despite the prior strength attempt (CLV 0.60 on 2026-01-19). This is a struggle between supply and potential stopping volume near the $26.25 region. The bearish context remains dominant.

**Key Levels:** 29.93 (Immediate Resistance), 26.25 (Stopping Volume Low), 27.00 (Chop Zone)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close above $28.71 on increasing volume (Demand confirmation), or close below $26.25 on high volume (Supply continuation).
- **Invalidation:** $26.25 (For long setup) / $28.71 (For short setup)
---
### AHR (BEARISH (Early Warning))
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is bullish. However, the weekly setup flags a Buying Climax. Week 2026-01-26 saw extremely high volume (RelVol 3.99) with a wide spread and a mid-range close (CLV 0.15), suggesting significant institutional selling into the move (Supply). The last week (2026-02-02) was also on high volume (RelVol 1.24) but closed strongly at the high (CLV 0.83). This presents conflicting signals: a massive shakeout last week followed by institutional pushing this week. We must wait for the test of the previous high, but the prior climax bar (2026-01-26) suggests supply remains present.

**Key Levels:** 48.80 (Recent High), 46.07 (Support), 45.37 (Major Support/Climax start)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Failure to hold $48.54 or clear break above $48.80 on reducing volume (No Supply Test).
- **Invalidation:** $45.37 (Break below major support/climax low)
---
### AIG (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Confirmed Strong)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is bearish and VSA confirms strong Supply Dominance. Early January saw heavy selling volume (RelVol 1.80, 1.74) with wide spreads down, resulting in poor closes (CLV -0.92, -0.58). Although there was a short-term recovery attempt (2026-01-26, CLV 0.96), the most recent bar (2026-02-02) shows high volume (RelVol 0.75) with a wide spread up, but the close is mediocre (CLV 0.22), indicating selling pressure absorbed the demand generated by the spread. This suggests Smart Money is continuing to unload into rallies.

**Key Levels:** 77.52 (Immediate Resistance/Supply zone), 73.50 (Support), 71.25 (Accumulation/Stopping Volume zone)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close below $73.50 on increased volume.
- **Invalidation:** $77.52 (Break above recent high, signifying significant demand)
---
### ALC (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Monthly) / Indecision (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is bearish, but the monthly action suggests Stopping Volume has entered. The recent weekly bars show choppy, indecisive action with volume hovering near average (RelVol 0.77 - 1.08). The last bar (2026-02-02) saw slightly elevated volume (RelVol 1.08) on a wide spread down (Spread 3.20), but the close was mid-range (CLV -0.11), which is better than a close on the low, suggesting some absorption. This implies accumulation is likely happening in the $77-$81 range, preparing for a markdown Test or markup.

**Key Levels:** 82.50 (Resistance), 76.95 (Stopping Volume Low/Support), 78.90 (Chop Mid-Point)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Clear No Supply test near $77, or a strong close above $81.65.
- **Invalidation:** $76.95 (Break below stopping volume low)
---
### ALL (BEARISH (Counter-trend setup))
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Confirmed Early)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is bullish, but the weekly sequence shows an early confirmation of Supply Dominance. The week 2026-01-12 saw very high volume (RelVol 2.04) on a wide spread down and an extremely poor close (CLV -0.94), confirming massive selling. The subsequent weeks saw choppy action near support. The latest bar (2026-02-02) is a strong up bar on high volume (RelVol 1.15, Spread 18.52), closing very high (CLV 0.83). However, this demand must be tested against the massive supply from 01/12. This aggressive push up might be an Upthrust After Distribution (UTAD) given the prior weakness.

**Key Levels:** 216.75 (New High/Potential UTAD), 191.80 (Initial Supply Shakeout Low), 198.22 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Failure of subsequent rally attempt, or a reversal bar closing below $215.19 on high volume.
- **Invalidation:** $216.75 (If price continues strongly higher, invalidating distribution thesis)
---
### AMH (BULLISH (Early indication))
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is bearish, but the sequence indicates Stopping Volume (SV). The high volume bars in early January (RelVol 2.52, 1.54) coincided with price holding above $30.50. The bars leading up to the most recent low are on low spread and average/slightly high volume (RelVol 0.91), closing mid-range (CLV 0.19). The presence of monthly confirmed SV reinforces the idea that smart money is accumulating. The low volume on the last down bar (relative to the SV bars) suggests supply is drying up.

**Key Levels:** 32.45 (Resistance), 30.13 (SV low/Support), 31.53 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Clear No Supply bar (narrow spread, low volume, closing high) near $30.50 or break above $31.53 on strength.
- **Invalidation:** $30.10 (Break below the lowest point of the current phase)
---
### ARE (NEUTRAL/BULLISH (Cautious))
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Monthly) / Rejection

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is bullish, reinforced by monthly Stopping Volume. The weekly sequence saw a bullish rally (Jan 5 - Jan 19) followed by a sharp rejection (2026-01-26: wide spread down, CLV -0.54, high volume RelVol 1.53). This suggests supply is present near $60. However, the last bar (2026-02-02) is a narrow spread with volume dropping (RelVol 0.72) and closing off the lows (CLV 0.18). This lack of follow-through selling post-rejection suggests the supply might be temporary or being absorbed (a successful Test).

**Key Levels:** 59.76 (Supply High), 53.14 (Support/Accumulation Zone), 56.52 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close above $56.52 on strength, confirming absorption.
- **Invalidation:** $53.14 (Break below recent low on high volume)
---
### ASML (BEARISH (Early Warning))
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Watch for Test) / Rejection

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is bullish, but weekly flags a Buying Climax. The strong up moves in early January were characterized by wide spreads and high CLV. However, week 2026-01-26 saw extreme volume (RelVol 1.96) on a wide spread up, but the close was poor (CLV -0.30), indicating supply entering. The last week (2026-02-02) confirmed this supply with another wide spread down on good volume (RelVol 1.05), closing near the low (CLV -0.50). This suggests a significant institutional sell-off from the high end of the recent rally.

**Key Levels:** 1493.48 (Climax High/Supply), 1316.06 (Support), 1398.80 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close below $1316.06 on high volume.
- **Invalidation:** $1493.48 (New High on reduced volume)
---
### ATI (BULLISH (Cautious))
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Watch for Test) / Demand Surge

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is bullish. The weekly sequence has been choppy near highs, initially suggesting a Buying Climax (CLV -0.23, -0.28). However, the last week (2026-02-02) saw a massive volume surge (RelVol 2.00) on an extremely wide spread up (Spread 17.87), closing off the high (CLV 0.06). While the poor CLV suggests some supply absorption, the sheer volume and spread size indicate enormous demand entering, possibly overpowering any attempts at distribution. This looks like a continuation move.

**Key Levels:** 137.00 (New High/Supply), 119.12 (Support), 120.30 (Previous Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Successful Test/No Supply bar near $127, or a clear break and hold above $137.00.
- **Invalidation:** $120.30 (Break below previous week's close/support)
---
### ATO (NEUTRAL/WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Watch for Test) / Indecision

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is bullish, and the weekly flags a Buying Climax. The price action is very choppy around $165-$172. Week 2026-01-26 showed high volume (RelVol 2.27) with a mid-range close (CLV -0.22). The latest bar (2026-02-02) is a wide spread up on high volume (RelVol 1.40) but closes poorly (CLV 0.39). This indicates institutional selling absorbing the demand at higher prices. The persistent high volume and inability to sustain movement above $170 suggests distribution/climax is likely underway.

**Key Levels:** 174.57 (High/Supply Zone), 164.50 (Support Zone), 169.39 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close below $164.50 on high volume.
- **Invalidation:** $174.57 (Break above the high on reducing volume)
---
### AXTI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Watch for Test) / Confirmed Markdown

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is bullish, but monthly flags a Buying Climax, indicating potential distribution. The weekly chart shows strong supply pressure. After a large up thrust (2026-01-05, RelVol 3.82), the volume remained extremely high but the price action deteriorated rapidly (CLV -0.37, -0.86). The last two weeks saw high volume (RelVol 1.49, 1.31) but weak closes, especially the 01/19 bar. The latest bar (2026-02-02) is a wide spread up on high volume (RelVol 1.31) but closes only mid-range (CLV 0.26), indicating institutional selling is absorbing the demand (Effort No Result Upwards). This is a distribution pattern.

**Key Levels:** 26.66 (Climax High), 16.50 (Swing Low/Accumulation hope), 22.69 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Failure to hold $20.43, followed by a break below $18.50 on high volume.
- **Invalidation:** $22.69 (Break above the recent swing high, confirming demand)
---
### BAM (NEUTRAL/WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Watch for Test) / Weakness

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is bearish, but weekly flags Stopping Volume (SV). The last two weeks saw high volume (RelVol 1.56, 1.82) on wide spreads, closing poorly (CLV -0.79) but then closing off the low (CLV -0.07). The volume surge on 2026-02-02 suggests heavy activity, possibly institutional accumulation (SV) absorbing the selling near the low of $46.75. However, the last bar is still technically weak, closing in the lower third.

**Key Levels:** 52.20 (Immediate Resistance), 46.76 (SV Low), 50.87 (Immediate High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Successful low volume test (No Supply) near $47, or a clear close above $52.20.
- **Invalidation:** $46.76 (Break below SV low on high volume)
---
### BBWI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Monthly Confirmed Early) / Rejection

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is bullish, but monthly confirms Supply Dominance. The price action is choppy, suggesting accumulation/distribution near the $22-$23 range. The rally high of $23.72 was immediately rejected (2026-01-19, CLV -0.13). The last bar (2026-02-02) saw average volume (RelVol 0.49) on a wide spread up, but the close was poor (CLV -0.12), indicating selling pressure (Effort No Result Upwards). This confirms supply is present and controlling the short-term movement.

**Key Levels:** 23.14 (Immediate Resistance), 21.54 (Support), 23.73 (Supply High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $21.54 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** $23.73 (Break above supply high)
---
### BE (BULLISH (Counter-trend potential))
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Monthly Confirmed Early) / Final Shakeout

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is bullish, but the market experienced a large markdown (Month Jan) suggesting major profit-taking/distribution. Monthly Stopping Volume is confirmed early. The latest weekly bar (2026-02-02) is a massive wide spread down (Spread 44.81) on high volume (RelVol 0.79) closing near the low (CLV -0.78). This looks like a final massive shakeout (Selling Climax/Spring) designed to stop out weak hands before a rally, supported by the earlier accumulation signals (high volume wide spread up bars in early Jan).

**Key Levels:** 176.49 (Prior High/Resistance), 131.68 (Shakeout Low/Potential Spring), 151.37 (Previous Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Immediate bullish reversal bar closing high on moderate volume (No Supply Test), confirming the Spring action.
- **Invalidation:** $131.68 (Sustained close below this low confirms markdown, not shakeout)
---
### BEP (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Monthly) / Rejection

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is bullish, but monthly flags Supply Dominance. The weekly chart shows weakness entering. After a strong up bar (2026-01-26, CLV 0.40), the last week (2026-02-02) showed moderate volume (RelVol 0.68) on a narrow spread, closing poorly (CLV -0.73). This poor close is a rejection of the high, confirming institutional supply is present and active near the $30.00 resistance area. This is a potential Upthrust.

**Key Levels:** 30.72 (Resistance/Upthrust High), 29.34 (Immediate Support), 28.21 (Major Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close below $29.34 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** $30.72 (Clear break above the high, invalidating Upthrust)
---
### BHP (BEARISH (Early Warning))
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Watch for Test) / Rejection

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is bullish, but weekly flags a Buying Climax. Week 2026-01-26 saw high volume (RelVol 1.84) on a wide spread up, but the close was poor (CLV -0.67), indicating supply entering. The last bar (2026-02-02) followed up with a narrow spread on average volume (RelVol 1.09) and a very poor close (CLV -0.83). This confirms supply is dominating the immediate action (Effort No Result Downwards). The inability to hold gains suggests distribution is occurring near the highs ($74.98).

**Key Levels:** 74.98 (Climax High/Supply), 68.69 (Immediate Support), 67.51 (Major Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close below $68.69 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** $74.98 (New high on reduced volume)
---
### BNS (NEUTRAL/WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Watch for Test) / Rejection

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is bullish, but Supply Dominance is present. The sequence shows conflicting signals near highs. Week 2026-01-05 saw high volume selling (CLV -0.60, RelVol 1.88). Weeks 01/12 and 01/19 saw strong recovery (high CLV). However, week 01/26 showed high volume (RelVol 0.92) with a wide spread, but closing poorly (CLV -0.58), indicating supply entering. The last bar (2026-02-02) is a narrow spread with average volume, closing mid-range (CLV 0.43). The overall high volume activity near the $75 level suggests a battle between demand and supply. The most recent supply signal (01/26) dictates caution.

**Key Levels:** 76.56 (Supply High), 73.72 (Support), 74.72 (Pivot Area)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Clear break above $76.56 on strength, or close below $73.72 on high volume.
- **Invalidation:** $73.72 (If initiating long) / $76.56 (If initiating short)
---
### BP (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Confirmed Early) / Effort No Result Upwards

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is bullish, but Supply Dominance is confirmed early. The price is currently in a narrow trading range near the highs, showing institutional unloading. Week 2026-01-26 was a strong up bar (CLV 0.16) on high volume (RelVol 1.20). The last bar (2026-02-02) attempted to continue the rally (wide spread up) but failed to hold the gains, closing mid-range (CLV -0.20) on sustained high volume (RelVol 1.20). This indicates clear Effort No Result Upwards, confirming selling pressure is absorbing the demand near $39.50.

**Key Levels:** 39.51 (Resistance/Supply), 37.29 (Immediate Support), 36.46 (Major Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close below $37.29 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** $39.51 (Sustained close above the high)
---
### BSX (NEUTRAL/WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Watch for Test) / Selling Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is bearish, and Supply Dominance is active. The last bar (2026-02-02) is critical: extreme volume (RelVol 2.87) on a huge spread down (Spread 19.31) closing near the low (CLV -0.71). This appears to be a Selling Climax, indicating maximum fear and capitulation. While bearish in the short-term, such high volume spikes at lows usually precede a change of character or accumulation phase. Smart money may be absorbing this supply.

**Key Levels:** 91.45 (Immediate Resistance), 74.86 (Selling Climax Low/Potential Accumulation Zone), 94.75 (Previous High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Immediate bullish response (No Supply) in the following week, or a close above $91.45 on strength.
- **Invalidation:** $74.86 (Sustained close below climax low on reduced volume)
---
### BX (NEUTRAL/WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Watch for Test) / Selling Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is bearish, with Supply Dominance flagged. The last bar (2026-02-02) is a massive shakeout/Selling Climax: extremely wide spread down (Spread 17.98) on high volume (RelVol 1.93) closing near the low (CLV -0.82). While this confirms strong supply, it is also typical of an exhausted selling movement. The volume suggests capitulation or institutional absorption near the low of $125.27.

**Key Levels:** 143.26 (Immediate Resistance), 125.27 (Selling Climax Low/Potential Spring), 150.50 (Broken Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Immediate bullish reversal bar (No Supply/Test) in the subsequent week, or a close above $143.26 on strength.
- **Invalidation:** $125.27 (Sustained close below climax low on reduced volume)
---
### CADE (NEUTRAL/WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Watch for Test) / Selling Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is bullish, but monthly flags a Buying Climax. The weekly chart shows a dramatic shakeout/Selling Climax at the end of January. Week 2026-01-26 saw extremely high volume (RelVol 4.79) on a narrow spread, closing poorly (CLV -0.48). This massive volume indicates institutional activity, likely either a large final shakeout before resuming the markup, or a confirmed break from the distribution zone. Given the prior bullish trend, this high-volume spike at the low end of the recent range is likely stopping volume/Selling Climax, demanding a reaction.

**Key Levels:** 44.86 (Immediate Resistance), 41.60 (Climax Low/Support), 46.74 (Previous High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Successful low volume Test/No Supply bar near $41.60, or a break above $44.86 on strength.
- **Invalidation:** $41.50 (Sustained close below the climax low)
---
### CAI (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
Weekly chart shows high volume (12.2M) on the last bar, which is a wide down bar closing near its low (CLV -0.95). While the prior week showed high volume (13.9M) also closing near low (CLV -0.98), the absolute volume remains elevated, suggesting panic selling (Weak Hands). The signal is STOPPING_VOLUME, indicating potential professional interest after a severe decline, but the close being so low suggests supply is still controlling the immediate term. Waiting for a Test or No Supply bar is crucial.

**Key Levels:** Support: 21.18, Resistance: 23.99

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 24.00 on reducing volume, or a clear Test/No Supply signal near 21.18.
- **Invalidation:** Below 21.18 (Weekly Low)
---
### CALX (NEUTRAL/BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is a wide up bar (Spread 7.41) closing well above the midpoint (CLV 0.60) on high volume (RelVol 1.66). This looks like a rebound or potential buying interest following the significant drop the prior week (wide down bar, high volume). However, the overall Quarterly Context is BEARISH_TREND, and the weekly sequence is SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (WATCH_FOR_TEST). This bar could be a sign of minor absorption or short covering, but is highly ambiguous. Need to see if this rally is met with supply quickly.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 52.11, Support: 44.70

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short if price fails to hold 50.00 and breaks 44.70. Long if price consolidates above 52.11.
- **Invalidation:** Above 52.11 (Weekly High)

### CBRL (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Effort to Rise

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is an up bar (Spread 4.73) closing above the midpoint (CLV 0.30) on average volume (RelVol 0.75). This is an effort to rise, but the low relative volume suggests the move lacks conviction from smart money, especially following the monthly SUPPLY_DOMINANCE context. Price closed strong near the high, but context warns of potential distribution.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 34.43, Support: 29.70

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Long entry on strength above 34.43 if volume increases. Short entry below 29.70 on supply confirmation.
- **Invalidation:** Below 29.70
---
### CBSH (NEUTRAL/BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort to Rise

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is an up bar (Spread 2.49) closing strongly near its high (CLV 0.63) on slightly above average volume (RelVol 1.00). This shows strong upward momentum, recovering from the prior week's movement. However, the monthly context indicates SUPPLY_DOMINANCE, suggesting overhead pressure remains. The last week suggests demand entered, pushing the price higher, but we need to break through significant resistance.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 54.84, 56.06, Support: 52.35

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Long entry on confirmed break above 55.00 with increased volume.
- **Invalidation:** Below 52.35
---
### CMPO (NEUTRAL/BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Effort No Result

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is a wide down bar (Spread 3.22) closing slightly below the midpoint (CLV -0.09) on high volume (RelVol 1.53). This wide spread and high volume after previous volatility (Stopping Volume signal) suggests either supply entering or absorption of recent weakness. Since the close is relatively neutral compared to the range, this bar suggests a potential pause or indecision, absorbing selling pressure near the lows (21.60).

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 24.82, Support: 21.60

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Long entry on close above 24.82 with confirmation of demand.
- **Invalidation:** Below 21.60 (Weekly Low)
---
### CNQ (NEUTRAL/BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is a wide up bar (Spread 2.93) closing above the midpoint (CLV 0.42) on high volume (RelVol 1.18). While the volume is high, the spread and the higher close suggest demand is absorbing the supply, countering the prior week's Supply Dominance test. This is a potential continuation signal within the bullish quarterly context, but the volume is still showing signs of previous distribution attempts (from high 38.32).

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 38.73, Support: 35.80

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Long entry upon break above 38.73.
- **Invalidation:** Below 35.80 (Weekly Low)
---
### CNXC (NEUTRAL/BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Climactic Action Follow-Through

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is a wide down bar (Spread 3.68) closing in the lower half (CLV -0.37) on high volume (RelVol 1.13). Following the previous week's severe distribution (wide down bar, CLV -0.63, high volume), this bar is trying to hold the 36.31 low but shows weak demand response, confirmed by the close in the lower half. The context is BEARISH_TREND, suggesting this weakness will likely continue.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 40.00, Support: 36.31

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on break below 36.31.
- **Invalidation:** Above 40.00 (Recent High)
---
### COHR (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Climactic Action

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is an extremely wide bar (Spread 66.26) closing just above the midpoint (CLV 0.02) on very high volume (RelVol 1.82). This bar traded from 241.5 down to 175.24 and closed near 209.24. This massive volatility and volume strongly suggests a climatic action (selling climax/shakeout) occurring at these levels. The neutral close indicates heavy two-sided trading, characteristic of institutional absorption/distribution. Given the Bullish Quarterly Context, this volatility might be a shakeout.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 241.50, Support: 175.24

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for clear confirmation (Test/No Supply) above 190.00 or break of 241.50.
- **Invalidation:** Below 175.24
---
### CORT (NEUTRAL/BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is a wide down bar (Spread 4.16) closing near its low (CLV -0.87) on average volume (RelVol 0.89). This is weak action. The previous weekly bar showed high volume distribution (CLV -0.40). The monthly context is BUYING_CLIMAX. The current price action confirms that selling pressure dominates immediately after the climax, suggesting Smart Money distribution is ongoing.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 42.26, Support: 38.10

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on break below 38.10.
- **Invalidation:** Above 42.26
---
### CVS (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Rebound

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is a medium-wide up bar (Spread 4.12) closing above the midpoint (CLV 0.42) on average volume (RelVol 0.99). This bar attempts to recover from the massive distribution bar two weeks prior (volume 87M, spread 13.3, CLV -0.42). While the recovery is positive, the lack of dominant volume suggests this might be short covering or a minor rebound before the continuation of the BEARISH Quarterly Trend. It confirms the SUPPLY_DOMINANCE status watching for a test.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 77.52, Support: 73.40

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Long entry on clear break above 77.52 with high volume. Short entry on failure to hold 73.40.
- **Invalidation:** Below 73.40
---
### ENR (NEUTRAL/BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort to Rise

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is a wide up bar (Spread 2.98) closing above the midpoint (CLV 0.20) on high volume (RelVol 1.42). While the close is not near the high, this represents continued effort to rise, recovering from the previous distribution efforts. The BULLISH Quarterly Trend supports a positive outlook, but the Monthly SUPPLY_DOMINANCE suggests resistance overhead. Needs to clear 24.54 convincingly.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 24.54, Support: 21.56

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Long entry on close above 24.54 with increased volume.
- **Invalidation:** Below 21.56
---
### FER (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Effort to Rise

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is a medium spread up bar (Spread 1.64) closing above the midpoint (CLV 0.42) on low volume (RelVol 0.52). This indicates demand is present but not aggressive, continuing a slow upward crawl after the prior week's movement. Given the Monthly SUPPLY_DOMINANCE context, this low volume rally might be a sign of weakness at the high end of the recent range.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 69.21, Support: 67.57

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Long entry on strong break above 69.21. Short entry on breakdown below 67.57.
- **Invalidation:** Below 67.57
---
### FFIN (NEUTRAL/BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort to Rise / Absorption

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is a wide up bar (Spread 2.94) closing very strong near its high (CLV 0.71) on average volume (RelVol 1.02). This is a strong demand signal, especially following the two previous weak weeks (Supply Dominance status). The buying managed to absorb previous selling and close near the weekly high, suggesting potential continuation in the BULLISH Quarterly Context.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 34.63, Support: 31.69

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Long entry on break above 34.63 with strong volume confirmation.
- **Invalidation:** Below 31.69 (Last Low)
---
### FFIV (NEUTRAL/BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Rebound Attempt

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is a wide down bar (Spread 16.01) closing near its low (CLV -0.73) on low volume (RelVol 0.64). The low volume suggests the rebound attempt failed quickly. Given the monthly STOPPING_VOLUME status (suggesting institutional interest below 275), this week's close back down near the lows is concerning. Smart money is not defending the prior week's high close (275.61) effectively.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 285.09, Support: 269.08

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on break below 269.08.
- **Invalidation:** Above 285.09 (Weekly High)
---
### FHB (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Indecision

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is a narrow spread up bar (Spread 1.42) closing slightly above the midpoint (CLV -0.01) on high volume (RelVol 1.26). The high volume with a narrow spread suggests heavy two-sided trading (fighting), but the close is almost flat (indecision). This follows a previous week of strong selling pressure, suggesting supply is being met by absorption, but neither side is clearly winning yet.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 27.43, Support: 26.01

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for clear confirmation bar. Break above 27.43 for long, break below 26.01 for short.
- **Invalidation:** Below 26.01
---
### FIBK (NEUTRAL/BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort to Rise

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is a wide up bar (Spread 3.10) closing above the midpoint (CLV 0.54) on average volume (RelVol 0.96). This is a strong recovery following the previous week's weakness (CLV -0.94). The monthly context is BUYING_CLIMAX, but the last bar suggests a strong short-term demand presence, potentially absorbing supply at lower levels.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 38.70, Support: 35.60

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Long entry on break above 38.70 with strong volume.
- **Invalidation:** Below 35.60
---
### GBCI (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result (Neutral)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is a medium spread up bar (Spread 3.65) closing virtually flat (CLV -0.002) on high volume (RelVol 1.37). This high volume/neutral close suggests significant two-sided trading, characteristic of distribution or absorption. Given the monthly SUPPLY_DOMINANCE, this is likely supply meeting demand, leading to indecision despite a significant upward range (50.33 to 53.98).

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 53.98, Support: 50.33

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for consolidation breakout. Long above 53.98, Short below 50.33.
- **Invalidation:** Below 50.33
---
### GE (NEUTRAL/BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Indecision

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is a medium spread bar (Spread 11.41) closing near the midpoint (CLV -0.06) on average volume (RelVol 1.01). This neutral close follows a strong up move the prior week (CLV 0.90) which recovered the severe weakness from the week before that. This suggests institutions are struggling to commit directionally after recent high volatility. The weekly signal is SUPPLY_DOMINANCE, indicating the short-term trend is struggling.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 312.43, Support: 301.02

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 312.43 for long, break below 301.02 for short.
- **Invalidation:** Below 301.02
---
### GKOS (NEUTRAL/BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result (Negative)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is a wide down bar (Spread 11.02) closing near the midpoint (CLV -0.49) on low volume (RelVol 0.55). The low volume suggests low interest in defending the prior rally levels. Following the monthly BUYING_CLIMAX, this is consistent with an internal shakeout or the start of a distribution correction. The lack of buying conviction on a down move is worrying for bulls.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 121.74, Support: 110.72

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on break below 110.72.
- **Invalidation:** Above 121.74
---
### GNTX (NEUTRAL/BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort to Rise / Absorption

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is a wide up bar (Spread 2.36) closing above the midpoint (CLV 0.44) on high volume (RelVol 1.13). This strong close signals immediate demand entering, overcoming the weakness seen in the previous two weeks (low CLV). Given the BULLISH Quarterly Trend, this is a positive sign of re-accumulation, though the Monthly SUPPLY_DOMINANCE suggests overhead resistance remains strong.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 25.14, Support: 22.78

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Long entry on confirmed close above 25.14.
- **Invalidation:** Below 22.78
---
### HDB (NEUTRAL/BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is a wide up bar (Spread 2.38) closing near its high (CLV 0.60) on high volume (RelVol 1.52). This is a strong demand signal, especially following the previous three weeks of sideways action near the lows (around 32). This strong close suggests smart money accumulation is occurring, potentially signaling an end to the short-term Supply Dominance phase.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 34.46, Support: 32.08

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Long entry on confirmed close above 34.46.
- **Invalidation:** Below 32.08 (Weekly Low)
---
### HUM (NEUTRAL/BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is an up bar (Spread 10.34) closing near the midpoint (CLV 0.46) on high volume (RelVol 1.08). This bar attempted to recover from the massive distribution/panic bar two weeks prior (volume 26.9M, spread 77.7). The high volume suggests professional buying absorbing the remaining panic supply. Given the magnitude of the previous drop, this consolidation is a positive first step toward potential accumulation.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 196.34, Support: 186.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Long entry on confirmed break above 196.34 (consolidation high).
- **Invalidation:** Below 186.00 (Weekly Low)
---
### IMAX (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Effort to Rise

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is a medium spread up bar (Spread 1.96) closing strongly near its high (CLV 0.85) on low volume (RelVol 0.62). This suggests demand is easily overcoming light supply. This upward move follows the monthly STOPPING_VOLUME signal, suggesting institutions might be starting to mark up the stock. However, the volume is too low for strong conviction.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 36.56, Support: 34.60

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Long entry on strong break above 36.56 with confirming volume.
- **Invalidation:** Below 34.60
---
### INVH (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is a narrow spread up bar (Spread 1.34) closing near the midpoint (CLV 0.23) on high volume (RelVol 1.19). High volume on a narrow, directionally neutral bar often signals absorption or distribution. Since the Quarterly Trend is BEARISH and both monthly/weekly alerts are STOPPING_VOLUME, this is likely institutional buying absorbing supply, keeping the price supported near 26.00.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 26.92, Support: 25.58

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Long entry on break above 26.92 with volume confirmation.
- **Invalidation:** Below 25.58
---
### JPM (NEUTRAL/BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Indecision

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is a wide up bar (Spread 17.94) closing slightly below the midpoint (CLV -0.02) on average volume (RelVol 0.93). This bar covered a massive range but closed weakly relative to that range, indicating significant supply entering, especially around the high of 319.31. This indecision reinforces the weekly SUPPLY_DOMINANCE status within a BEARISH Quarterly Trend.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 319.31, Support: 301.37

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on break below 301.37. Long entry on strong break above 319.31.
- **Invalidation:** Above 319.31
---
### KYMR (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result (Neutral)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is a wide up bar (Spread 8.43) closing slightly above the midpoint (CLV 0.12) on average volume (RelVol 0.83). This wide spread with a mediocre close suggests supply met the upward move, absorbing the demand. Given the monthly BUYING_CLIMAX, this is likely consolidation/distribution at higher levels before a correction.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 79.61, Support: 71.18

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on break below 71.18. Long entry on confirmed break above 79.61.
- **Invalidation:** Below 71.18
---
### LHX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly chart shows a strong rally ending in the 2026-01-12 bar, which had very high volume (RelVol 2.09) and a wide spread, but closed significantly off the high (CLV -0.05). This is a potential Buying Climax (BC). The subsequent weeks show attempts to push higher (2026-01-19 and 2026-01-26 high volume), but the price failed to hold gains, resulting in lower closes, especially the high volume, wide spread down bar on 2026-01-26 (CLV -0.78). This confirms supply overwhelming demand near the recent highs. The latest bar (2026-02-02) is a down bar on lower volume (RelVol 0.96), confirming the lack of demand and the 'Watch for Test' status implies Smart Money is now testing the low demand area before marking down.

**Key Levels:** $361.59 (BC High), $332.88 (BC Low Support), $342.22 (Last Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $332.88 support (Low of BC week)
- **Invalidation:** $361.59 (BC High)
---
### MOD (NEUTRAL/BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Weak)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BULLISH. The weekly chart shows strong bullish momentum, especially the last two weeks (2026-01-26 and 2026-02-02) with high volume (RelVol 1.78 and 1.68) wide-spread bars closing near their highs (CLV 0.78 and 0.77). Although the Algo detected 'Stopping Volume' (which usually precedes a reversal), the momentum here suggests a blow-off top or final thrust. Given the strong CLV and high volume on the last bar, this suggests persistent demand, pushing the price higher. If the detection is correct, we are watching for a subsequent reversal, but currently, demand is in control. The prior low volume (2026-01-19, RelVol 0.67) indicates low participation before the breakout.

**Key Levels:** $208.00 (New High), $184.00 (Recent Support), $205.32 (Last Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Confirmation of weakness (e.g., No Demand test of $184)
- **Invalidation:** N/A (Bullish context, waiting for supply confirmation)
---
### MTCH (NEUTRAL/BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BEARISH. However, the latest weekly bar (2026-02-02) shows a very wide spread (4.59) on huge volume (RelVol 1.96), but the close is off the low (CLV -0.11), suggesting heavy buying occurred after the initial markdown to $28.80. This bar acts as potential Stopping Volume (SV), challenging the recent bearish momentum. The market context is weak, so confirmation is needed. Smart Money may be accumulating at these lower levels.

**Key Levels:** $33.40 (SV High), $28.81 (SV Low), $30.85 (Last Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and test above $31.33 (confirmation of demand absorbing supply)
- **Invalidation:** $28.81 (If price breaks below SV low, markdown continues)
---
### NFXL (NEUTRAL/BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BEARISH. The weekly chart shows multiple high-volume down bars, peaking on 2026-01-19 (RelVol 3.33) with a wide spread, but the bar closed slightly off the low (CLV -0.006). The latest bar (2026-02-02) has high relative volume (RelVol 1.04) and a wide spread, but also closed mid-range (CLV -0.50). While still weak, the high volume on the last two bars following a sharp drop suggests potential Stopping Volume or accumulation occurring, though the close is still low. We need confirmation of demand strength. Current price action is messy at the lows.

**Key Levels:** $24.97 (Resistance), $21.53 (Potential Accumulation Low), $22.38 (Last Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Test of $21.53 followed by a bullish reversal confirmation
- **Invalidation:** $21.53 (Break below confirms continuation)
---
### NICE (NEUTRAL/BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Absorption

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BEARISH, but the monthly sequence suggests Supply Dominance is under 'Confirmed Early' status. The weekly chart shows significant volatility. The bar 2026-01-26 was a wide-spread down bar on good volume, closing near the low (CLV -0.92), confirming supply. However, the latest bar (2026-02-02) exhibits high volume (RelVol 1.27) and a wide spread, closing significantly off the low (CLV 0.26). This is a potential sign of professional money stepping in to absorb supply, preventing a full markdown, despite the bearish trend context. We are watching for a follow-through.

**Key Levels:** $117.21 (Resistance), $104.73 (Accumulation Low), $110.48 (Last Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $113.85 with strong volume (confirming demand)
- **Invalidation:** $104.73 (Break below confirms supply continuation)
---
### NYT (NEUTRAL/BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BEARISH. The last weekly bar (2026-02-02) is a very wide spread down bar on massive volume (RelVol 2.42). Crucially, despite the massive spread, the close is substantially off the low (CLV 0.35). This suggests Stopping Volume, where Smart Money absorbs supply during the aggressive markdown. This is a preliminary sign of potential accumulation or short-covering. The market is trying to find a footing after a sharp drop.

**Key Levels:** $74.04 (Last High), $58.87 (SV Low), $69.11 (Last Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A subsequent No Supply bar closing strong above $69.11
- **Invalidation:** $58.87 (Break below confirms further weakness)
---
### ONB (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Demand Persistence

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BULLISH. Although the monthly context indicates strong supply, the weekly chart is highly resilient. The last bar (2026-02-02) is a wide-spread up bar on moderate volume (RelVol 0.77), closing near the high (CLV 0.54). This is a successful test and continuation of demand, despite the monthly signal. The narrow spread and high close suggests efficiency and low residual supply, especially given the market environment is choppy/down. Smart Money is clearly holding this name up.

**Key Levels:** $25.94 (New High), $24.28 (Recent Support), $25.56 (Last Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $25.94 on confirming volume
- **Invalidation:** $24.28 (Low of the last demand wave)
---
### OZK (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Failed Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the weekly sequence is confirmed 'SUPPLY_DOMINANCE'. The week of 2026-01-19 showed a strong supply candle (wide down bar, high volume, CLV -0.91). The last bar (2026-02-02) attempted to rally to a new high ($50.65), but the volume (RelVol 0.83) was only moderate, and the close was mid-range (CLV 0.58). While the bar is up, the Supply Dominance confirmation from the prior week suggests the rally is weak and likely a test of supply. Smart Money is liquidating, making continuation difficult.

**Key Levels:** $49.69 (Recent High), $45.77 (Support), $49.89 (Last Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Weakness confirmed by a down bar on low volume below $49.89
- **Invalidation:** $50.66 (New High, break above invalidates supply thesis)
---
### PSN (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the monthly sequence is 'WATCH_FOR_TEST' of Supply Dominance. The latest weekly bar (2026-02-02) is a down bar on low volume (RelVol 0.60) closing near the low (CLV -0.71). Although the volume isn't explosive, the consistent closing near the lows over the last two weeks (CLV -0.57, -0.71) indicates supply is successfully overcoming demand, pushing the price lower within the range. Given the monthly Supply Dominance context, this continuation of weakness suggests Smart Money is controlling the current downtrend.

**Key Levels:** $73.26 (Resistance), $67.11 (Support), $67.52 (Last Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $67.11 confirming the monthly supply
- **Invalidation:** $73.26 (High of consolidation range)
---
### PTC (NEUTRAL/BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BEARISH. The latest weekly bar (2026-02-02) is a wide spread bar on high volume (RelVol 1.88). Critically, it reversed strongly from the low to close mid-range (CLV 0.24). This suggests significant buying/Stopping Volume entered the market at the low ($146.72), absorbing heavy supply. The prior bars showed consistent downside pressure, making this reversal attempt notable. This is a potential accumulation signal against the prevailing bearish trend.

**Key Levels:** $158.34 (Resistance), $146.72 (SV Low), $153.94 (Last Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and test above $158.34 (confirmation of strength)
- **Invalidation:** $146.72 (Break below SV low confirms failure)
---
### PTGX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BEARISH, and the monthly sequence is 'WATCH_FOR_TEST' of Buying Climax, suggesting recent weakness. The latest weekly bar (2026-02-02) is a wide-spread down bar on moderate volume (RelVol 0.73), closing near the low (CLV -0.84). This confirms the recent rejection of higher prices (2026-01-26, high $84.31) and indicates Supply Dominance has taken over, pushing the price towards the lows of the past three months. The context remains bearish, despite the moderate volume.

**Key Levels:** $86.09 (Resistance), $80.20 (Recent Low), $80.67 (Last Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $80.20 (continuation of markdown)
- **Invalidation:** $84.32 (Above recent distribution point)
---
### RARE (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the monthly sequence is 'WATCH_FOR_TEST' of Supply Dominance. The weekly chart shows volatility and recent weakness. The last bar (2026-02-02) is a wide spread down bar on moderate volume (RelVol 0.95), closing near the low (CLV -0.79). This confirms Supply Dominance is taking hold, pushing the price away from the recent high of $25.81. The attempt to mark up the price failed, resulting in a low close, indicative of Smart Money liquidating into the strength.

**Key Levels:** $25.82 (Resistance), $23.56 (Support), $23.79 (Last Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $23.56 (confirming continuation of supply)
- **Invalidation:** $25.00 (Above prior week's high)

### RKT (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BEARISH, and the monthly context is confirmed Supply Dominance. The weekly chart confirms supply saturation. The week of 2026-01-26 was a strong down bar on high volume (RelVol 1.04), closing near the low (CLV -0.59). The latest bar (2026-02-02) is a wide spread bar on high volume (RelVol 0.90), but the close is middle range (CLV -0.12). While the close is off the low, the dominant action over the past two weeks remains heavily bearish, breaking key support. The slight reversal in the final bar might be short covering, but the overall context remains one of Supply Dominance.

**Key Levels:** $21.37 (Resistance), $17.05 (New Low Support), $19.20 (Last Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $17.05 (continuation)
- **Invalidation:** $21.19 (Above high of latest bar)
---
### RTO (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Supply Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BULLISH. The week of 2026-01-26 was a wide down bar on high volume (RelVol 1.36), closing near the low (CLV -0.78), potentially Stopping Volume. The latest bar (2026-02-02) is a narrow spread up bar on very high volume (RelVol 2.27), but the close is only moderate (CLV 0.36). This is an 'Effort No Result Up' situation, indicating that despite significant demand effort (high volume), the market struggled to make meaningful progress. This suggests residual supply is absorbing the demand, likely testing the Selling Climax area.

**Key Levels:** $33.46 (Resistance), $31.28 (Support/SV Low), $32.27 (Last Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Bullish: Break above $33.46. Bearish: Break below $31.28
- **Invalidation:** $31.28 (Failure to hold this level confirms supply)
---
### RVMD (NEUTRAL/BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Absorption/Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the monthly sequence suggests a Buying Climax, implying recent supply. The week of 2026-01-26 saw a sharp drop on high volume (RelVol 1.49). The latest bar (2026-02-02) is a narrow-to-moderate spread bar on low volume (RelVol 0.65), closing mid-range (CLV 0.11). The low volume suggests a weak reaction to the prior week's selling, which could be interpreted as a 'No Supply' test. If the price holds above the low of $93.01, demand may be ready to re-engage, confirming accumulation.

**Key Levels:** $98.64 (Resistance), $93.02 (Potential Accumulation Low), $96.15 (Last Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $98.64 on high volume (confirming demand)
- **Invalidation:** $93.02 (Break below suggests distribution continuation)
---
### RYAAY (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BEARISH. The latest weekly bar (2026-02-02) is a wide spread bar on moderate volume (RelVol 0.94), showing a strong rejection of the low to close significantly off the low (CLV -0.88). While the close is technically down, the large wick and position off the low, combined with the wide spread on high volume, constitutes Stopping Volume. This indicates Smart Money buying aggressively at the lows, challenging the recent markdown phase. This is a preliminary accumulation signal.

**Key Levels:** $72.56 (Resistance), $67.24 (SV Low), $67.55 (Last Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A subsequent tight-spread up bar on high volume
- **Invalidation:** $67.24 (Break below confirms continuation of markdown)
---
### RYN (NEUTRAL/BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the monthly sequence suggests a Buying Climax. The week of 2026-01-26 saw extreme volume (RelVol 3.72) and a wide down bar, closing mid-range (CLV -0.20), likely a massive Stopping Volume event. However, the follow-through (2026-02-02) is a narrow spread down bar on high volume (RelVol 1.67), closing poorly (CLV -0.41). High volume on a narrow, down bar suggests supply pressure, potentially indicating a failed test of the prior Stopping Volume area. This suggests supply is still dominating, despite the bullish quarterly context.

**Key Levels:** $24.01 (Resistance), $21.90 (Support), $22.52 (Last Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $21.90 (confirming distribution)
- **Invalidation:** $24.82 (Above the distribution zone)
---
### SSNC (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BEARISH. The week of 2026-01-26 showed strong selling (wide down bar, CLV -0.82) on high volume (RelVol 1.10). The latest bar (2026-02-02) is an ultra-wide spread down bar on high volume (RelVol 2.11), although the close is significantly off the low (CLV -0.31). This combination suggests extreme supply initially, which was countered by some buying (Stopping Volume). However, the massive volatility and low close still confirm the dominance of supply over the past two weeks, pushing the price into a markdown phase.

**Key Levels:** $82.81 (Resistance), $70.89 (New Low Support), $74.98 (Last Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Weak bounce followed by a break below $70.89
- **Invalidation:** $82.81 (Above the recent high)
---
### SYF (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Supply Absorption / Effort No Result Down

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BEARISH. The last two bars show high volume selling, indicating strong supply. The latest bar (2026-02-02) has a moderate spread on high volume (RelVol 1.01), but the close is middle-range (CLV -0.01). The struggle to push lower despite high volume suggests absorption of supply or short-covering, but the lack of an upward close ('Effort No Result Down') prevents a clear bullish signal. Smart Money is still contending with significant supply in a bearish trend.

**Key Levels:** $75.81 (Resistance), $72.22 (Support), $73.99 (Last Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $75.81 (confirming demand) or break below $72.22 (confirming supply)
- **Invalidation:** N/A (Range-bound decision expected)
---
### TER (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Blow-off

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BULLISH. The latest bar (2026-02-02) is an ultra-wide spread up bar on huge volume (RelVol 1.80), closing near the high (CLV 0.11). This is a classic 'Blow-off Top' or Buying Climax event, where Smart Money uses excessive public euphoria to liquidate positions. While the close is high, the huge volume on the wide spread suggests exhaustion of buyers. Given the 'WATCH_FOR_TEST' status from the algo, we anticipate a test for supply next week, confirming distribution.

**Key Levels:** $295.50 (BC High), $240.67 (BC Low), $271.13 (Last Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Weakness confirmed by an immediate down bar on high volume, or No Demand test of $270.
- **Invalidation:** N/A (Bearish setup, monitoring for downside confirmation)
---
### TFX (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Test / No Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BEARISH. However, recent weeks have shown decreased downside momentum. The last two bars reversed their low closes. The latest bar (2026-02-02) is a moderate spread up bar on high volume (RelVol 1.31), closing strongly (CLV 0.53). This action, after several weeks of intense supply, suggests successful demand absorption and a potential start of an accumulation phase. The strong closing position suggests Smart Money is buying and marking up the price, challenging the bearish quarterly trend.

**Key Levels:** $107.16 (Resistance), $101.65 (Support), $105.89 (Last Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $107.16 on confirming volume
- **Invalidation:** $101.65 (Break below confirms supply continuation)
---
### TRU (NEUTRAL/BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BEARISH, but the monthly sequence suggests 'CONFIRMED_STRONG' Stopping Volume. The latest weekly bar (2026-02-02) is a wide spread down bar on high volume (RelVol 1.53), but the close is significantly off the low (CLV -0.32). This is a strong potential Stopping Volume signal, indicating Smart Money absorption at the lows ($65.23). This volume climax suggests institutional buying is occurring against the bearish pressure, preparing for a potential reversal.

**Key Levels:** $79.90 (Resistance), $65.23 (SV Low), $70.22 (Last Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Confirmation of demand (e.g., strong up bar or No Supply test above $70.22)
- **Invalidation:** $65.23 (Violation of SV low)
---
### WGMI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort Down / Selling Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
An extremely wide spread down bar on very high volume (RelVol 1.37), closing near the absolute low (CLV -0.96). This VSA signature confirms massive institutional dumping, likely accelerating the markdown phase following a previously detected Buying Climax in January. The low of $34.99 represents a critical shakeout level.

**Key Levels:** $35.00 (Climax Low), $42.80 (Prior Support Break), $46.62 (Supply High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry confirmation below $34.99, or on a weak test of the $40 support level.
- **Invalidation:** Close above $47.40 (Prior week's high).
---
### WPM (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Continuing Supply / Effort No Result Up

**Smart Money Logic:**
Following a massive Supply Dominance bar (Upthrust) last week, the price attempted a rally this week. However, the advance failed quickly, resulting in a wide spread bar that closed very weakly (CLV -0.71) on high volume (RelVol 1.28). This 'Effort No Result Up' confirms that institutional supply is aggressively dominating the market and utilizing short-term rallies for distribution. Markdown is likely to continue.

**Key Levels:** $160.36 (Distribution Peak), $141.30 (Immediate Supply Resistance), $129.12 (Immediate Demand Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry below $129.12, confirming the breakdown of the current trading range.
- **Invalidation:** Close above $141.30.
---
### ZM (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Weakness on Rally / Confirmed Distribution

**Smart Money Logic:**
The price is confirming the Buying Climax/Upthrust detected last week. The current week saw high volume (RelVol 1.43) on a wide spread bar that failed to hold its gains, closing below the midpoint (CLV -0.47). This heavy supply response immediately following the climax confirms institutional selling in the $90-$97 zone, indicating distribution and the likelihood of a pending correction or trading range.

**Key Levels:** $97.58 (Climax Supply), $94.29 (Immediate Supply Resistance), $87.19 (Demand Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry below $87.19, breaking the low of the initial weakness bar.
- **Invalidation:** Close above $94.29.
