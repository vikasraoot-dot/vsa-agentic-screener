## 🚀 Ready for Entry
### ABVX (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Absorption of Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
After a sharp drop on Jan 26, the price recovered steadily on Feb 02 and Feb 16. Note that volume is decreasing during this recovery, which in VSA usually indicates 'No Demand,' but given the Quarterly Bullish trend and high CLV, it suggests smart money has removed the floating supply after the shakeout.

**Key Levels:** 110.98, 125.00, 133.42

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Breakout above 133.50 with a spike in volume.
- **Invalidation:** 123.90
---
### ACM (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Shakeout

**Smart Money Logic:**
Massive volume (2.5x RelVol) on Feb 09 resulted in a deep plunge but was immediately met by high-volume buying on Feb 16 (CLV 0.94). This 'V-shape' recovery on high volume is a classic VSA shakeout, indicating smart money utilized the panic to accumulate shares.

**Key Levels:** 87.55, 97.89, 109.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Follow-through above 98.20.
- **Invalidation:** 88.10
---
### AEHR (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Volatility Shakeout

**Smart Money Logic:**
The massive volume spike on Feb 09 (1.82x RelVol) was a shakeout bar. The subsequent bar on Feb 16 closed at the extreme high (CLV 1.0) on decent volume, confirming that the supply introduced during the spike has been absorbed.

**Key Levels:** 25.58, 33.67, 37.49

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Breakout above 34.00.
- **Invalidation:** 26.00
---
### AGIO (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Professional Support

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stock showed stopping volume on the monthly chart. On the weekly, the Feb 16 bar shows a strong close (CLV 0.97) on steady volume, indicating that smart money is supporting the 26.00-27.00 level.

**Key Levels:** 26.04, 27.96, 29.93

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Current price is attractive; entry on break of 29.30.
- **Invalidation:** 26.00
---
### AMZN (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Accumulation

**Smart Money Logic:**
Huge volume on the Feb 02/Feb 09 sell-off suggests a climax. The Feb 16 bar is highly significant: it is a wide spread up bar with high volume (1.2x) and a very high CLV (0.86). Professional money stepped in to stop the decline at 196.

**Key Levels:** 196.00, 211.17, 236.74

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Long at current levels or on a minor pullback to 205.
- **Invalidation:** 196.00
---
### AXTI (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Professional Buying

**Smart Money Logic:**
Tremendous volume over the last 3 months indicates high interest. The Feb 16 bar is very bullish: high volume, wide spread, and closed near the high. This represents 'Effort' that is successfully producing 'Results'.

**Key Levels:** 22.59, 29.68, 30.80

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 30.80.
- **Invalidation:** 23.10
---
### BBWI (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Absorption of Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
While the monthly timeframe shows supply dominance, the weekly sequence shows price rising on increasing volume with a very high CLV (0.90) on 2026-02-09. The latest week shows a narrow spread with sustained volume, suggesting smart money is absorbing the remaining supply to push higher.

**Key Levels:** 24.94 (Resistance), 22.04 (Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Clean break and close above 25.00
- **Invalidation:** 23.62
---
### BCE (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
A high-volume shakeout occurred on 2026-02-02. Since then, volume has dried up significantly (RelVol 0.70) while price holds near its highs with a high CLV (0.83). Professionals are no longer selling, and the path of least resistance is up.

- **Invalidation:** 25.45

- **Invalidation:** 51.43
---
### CBRL (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Test of Strength

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Price close above 34.50
- **Invalidation:** 30.62
---
### CCI (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Strength Returning

**Key Levels:** 91.08 (Resistance), 77.01 (Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Move above 90.50
- **Invalidation:** 85.90
---

- **Invalidation:** 16.92
---
### CUZ (BULLISH)

- **Invalidation:** 112.50
---
### ICLR (BULLISH)

**Key Levels:** 155.00, 66.57

#### Action Plan

- **Invalidation:** 87.90
---

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 39.20
- **Invalidation:** 36.00
---
### IOT (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 28.30
- **Invalidation:** 24.80
---
### ITT (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply

### WHR (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
Significant Stopping Volume appeared on Jan 26 with RelVol at 2.14. This was professional money absorbing panicking retail supply.

**Key Levels:** $72.55 (Support), $88.85 (Weekly Pivot), $94.82 (Major Resistance)

---
### WMG (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Absorption

**Smart Money Logic:**
The bar on Feb 2 showed massive relative volume (2.34) with a long lower tail (CLV 0.32), signaling Stopping Volume. The last three weeks have seen price stabilize despite the bearish quarterly context. The high CLV (0.87) on the most recent week suggests the 'Test' of the supply was successful and buyers are taking control.

**Key Levels:** $26.42 (Major Support), $30.00 (Psychological Resistance), $31.20 (Swing High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Daily close above $30.10 on rising volume.

---
### WPM (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Absorption of Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
Following a massive supply spike on Jan 26, price found support quickly. The most recent bar (Feb 16) is very bullish: price closed near the high (CLV 0.96) on slightly lower volume, suggesting that the supply from the previous weeks has been absorbed and the path of least resistance is now up.

**Key Levels:** $130.33 (Major Low), $150.61 (Local Resistance), $160.36 (Historical High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A move above $151.00 confirming the absorption of the Jan 26 supply bar.
- **Invalidation:** $137.50
---
### WRB (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
Within a bullish quarterly trend, the last two weeks show price creeping higher on very low relative volume (0.78 and 0.69). This lack of volume on narrow spreads indicates a 'No Supply' environment, where professional money is not selling. This often precedes a further markup.

**Key Levels:** $68.37 (Recent Pivot), $73.07 (Resistance), $65.02 (Long-term Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A high-volume breakout above $72.10.

## 👀 Watch/Monitoring
### ABT (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
Significant supply hit the market on Jan 19 with very high relative volume (2.57x). However, subsequent weeks show volume receding while price stabilizes, suggesting supply is being absorbed. The high CLV (0.90) on Feb 02 indicates buying at the lows, but we need a successful test on low volume to confirm the bottom.

**Key Levels:** 105.27, 113.76, 122.48

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A low-volume test of the 106-107 area followed by a bullish engulfing bar.
- **Invalidation:** 105.00
---
### ACLX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stock is in a clear bearish trend with supply dominating. The move on Feb 16 shows an increase in relative volume on a down-close with a very low CLV (-0.76), indicating that sellers are still aggressive and there is no significant 'Stopping Volume' yet.

**Key Levels:** 63.14, 68.50, 71.25

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short on a weak rally to 68.00 that fails on low volume.
- **Invalidation:** 71.50
---
### ACWI (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result (Bearish Tinge)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Price is making new highs, but the volume on Feb 09 was massive (2.1x RelVol) for a relatively small spread and a negative CLV (-0.35). This suggests supply is starting to meet the demand (churning). The recovery on Feb 16 was on lower volume.

**Key Levels:** 144.38, 147.67, 148.41

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a clear test of 144.00 or a breakout above 148.50.
- **Invalidation:** 144.00
---
### ADP (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Aggressive distribution is evident. Multiple weeks of high relative volume (1.5x to 2.1x) accompanying wide price spreads to the downside. The lack of a high CLV bounce suggests that smart money is not yet stepping in to stop the fall.

**Key Levels:** 208.62, 218.85, 230.28

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short on any low-volume 'Up-Thrust' toward 218.
- **Invalidation:** 231.00
---
### ADSK (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
Extreme selling pressure peaked on Feb 09 with 1.8x RelVol. The Feb 16 bar shows a significant narrowing of price spread (11.12 vs 31.11) on lower volume, which is an early sign that the selling force is becoming exhausted.

**Key Levels:** 216.00, 221.08, 232.21

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A 'Test in a Rising Market'—price dips toward 221 and recovers on low volume.
- **Invalidation:** 216.00
---
### AFRM (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Price is cascading lower on rising relative volume. The CLV remains consistently negative or neutral, showing that the market closes near the bottom of the weekly range. There is no VSA evidence of accumulation here yet.

**Key Levels:** 48.55, 52.89, 59.69

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short below 49.00.
- **Invalidation:** 55.00
---
### ASML (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
Price is in a parabolic-style move with expanding volume and wide spreads. While bullish, the Feb 16 bar shows a high CLV (0.66) but lower relative volume compared to Jan, suggesting the 'Effort' is starting to dwindle. Use caution as a climax may be approaching.

**Key Levels:** 1382.00, 1487.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Breakout above 1487 on high volume.
- **Invalidation:** 1380.00
---
### AZN (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result (Supply Entering)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Massive volume spikes (19x and 9x RelVol) on Feb 02 and Feb 09 drove the price up. However, the Feb 16 bar closed near the dead low (CLV -0.96) on high volume. This is a classic 'Up-Thrust' or 'Buying Climax' signal, indicating significant supply has entered the market.

**Key Levels:** 187.06, 204.20, 212.71

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Avoid longs; look for short if 204.00 breaks decisively.
- **Invalidation:** 213.00
---
### BBVA (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply / Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
Significant high-volume selling occurred between 2026-02-02 and 2026-02-09, characterized by high RelVol and negative CLV. The latest week shows a decrease in volume and spread, which in VSA terms is a 'No Supply' test. However, this occurs after a major supply dominance signal, suggesting this is a temporary pause before further decline.

**Key Levels:** 22.50 (Support), 24.09 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Breakdown below 22.50 on high volume
- **Invalidation:** 24.10
---
### BE (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
Massive volume spikes on down weeks suggest a selling climax or 'Stopping Volume.' The high volatility and wide spreads indicate a battle between smart money buyers and panicked sellers. Market needs to stabilize before a clear direction emerges.

**Key Levels:** 131.00 (Major Support), 176.49 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Successful test of 131.00 on low volume
- **Invalidation:** 131.00
---
### BEP (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Upthrust / End of Rising Market

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 30.90
- **Invalidation:** 32.80

### BFAM (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Shakeout

**Smart Money Logic:**
Extreme RelVol (2.40) on the crash of 2026-02-09 followed by a high-volume recovery week with a strong CLV (0.83). This suggests professional absorption near the lows, but the overall trend is severely damaged.

**Key Levels:** 63.68 (Support), 73.00 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Higher low confirmation on weekly chart
- **Invalidation:** 63.60
---
### BHP (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Overextended

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stock is in a strong uptrend with a very high CLV (0.91) on the most recent week. However, the 'Algo Detection' of a Buying Climax warns that professionals may be using the strength to offload to late-comers. Watch for a 'Test' of the high volume.

- **Invalidation:** 70.30

### BRBR (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

---
### BSX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Distribution

- **Invalidation:** 80.00

### PYPL (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
The massive 300M+ volume bar on Feb 2nd represents a classic climax/stopping volume. Last week's narrow spread close higher on high volume suggests absorption is ongoing.

### RF (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Up-thrust in a Bullish Trend

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stock hit a local top on high volume and is now drifting. While quarterly context is bullish, the lack of follow-through last week suggests short-term exhaustion.

- **Invalidation:** 29.20

### WGMI (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Supply Drying Up

**Smart Money Logic:**
After a high-volume wide-spread down bar on Feb 2, the subsequent two weeks show significantly diminishing volume (RelVol 0.60 and 0.50). This indicates that while the trend is down, professional selling pressure is withdrawing. Smart money is no longer aggressively pushing price lower, but a successful 'Test' is required to confirm a bottom.

**Key Levels:** $34.99 (Recent Low), $41.47 (Resistance), $46.62 (Pivot High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A low-volume 'Test' bar followed by a high-volume up-bar closing above $41.50.
- **Invalidation:** $34.90
---
### WPC (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Entering / Effort No Result

**Smart Money Logic:**
Price has moved up into the $74 level, but the most recent week shows the highest volume in 5 weeks (RelVol 1.84) resulting in a down-close (CLV -0.13). This is a classic 'Effort No Result' signal where professional selling has capped the advance, suggesting a pullback is imminent.

**Key Levels:** $74.72 (Resistance), $70.60 (Support), $68.28 (Structural Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $72.00 on high volume for a short-term correction play.
- **Invalidation:** $74.80
---
### XYL (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The massive down bar on Feb 9 (RelVol 2.46) destroyed the previous bullish momentum. The most recent week shows 'No Demand' - a narrow spread up-close on low volume (RelVol 1.30 compared to the crash volume). Sellers are still in control and buyers are hesitant to step in.

**Key Levels:** $123.98 (Critical Support), $131.35 (Resistance), $142.97 (Broken Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break of $127.00 for target $120.00.
- **Invalidation:** $132.50
---
### Z (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Extreme professional selling is evident. The week of Feb 9 showed a massive RelVol of 2.95 on a wide spread down. The current week's attempted bounce on 1.66 RelVol closed with a low CLV (0.20), suggesting that every attempt to rally is being sold into by smart money.

**Key Levels:** $42.50 (Support), $47.31 (Resistance), $53.61 (Broken Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Failure to hold $44.00 on the daily timeframe.
- **Invalidation:** $47.50
---
### ZM (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Distribution

**Smart Money Logic:**
The high volume spike on Jan 26 (RelVol 2.00) with a mid-range close (CLV 0.01) marked a Buying Climax. Since then, price has failed to make new highs despite several attempts, and volume is tailing off on the down bars. This indicates the 'Smart Money' distributed their shares into the late-buyer strength.

**Key Levels:** $97.58 (Climax High), $88.02 (Weekly Low), $86.40 (Pivot Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $88.00 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** $93.50
