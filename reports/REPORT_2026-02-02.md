---
### ALL (BULLISH)

### HRMY (BEARISH Watch)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Rejection

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the Monthly sequence shows strong SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (Watch for Test). The week of 2026-01-12 was a wide spread down bar on high volume (1.03x), closing near the low (CLV -34%), signifying significant selling. The most recent bar (2026-01-26) was a wide spread down bar on 0.74x RelVol, closing very poorly (CLV -61%). This confirms that Supply is aggressive, pushing the price lower, despite the longer-term bullish quarterly trend. This suggests a potential deep correction or reversal of the intermediate trend.

**Key Levels:** Support Zone: 34.68 (Recent low), Resistance: 37.40 (Previous weekly high), Supply Origin: 39.40

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $36.17 (Recent low of last bar) or confirmation of further weakness below $34.68.
- **Invalidation:** $38.00 (Above recent high spread)

### ING (BEARISH Watch)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Effort No Result (Up)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the Weekly sequence shows a clear BUYING_CLIMAX (Watch for Test). The last bar (2026-01-26) was a wide spread up bar on massive relative volume (1.92x), yet it closed poorly (CLV -23%), creating a classic Effort No Result Up signal, strongly indicating heavy supply meeting the attempted rally. The preceding bars showed steady demand, but this bar marks a key reversal attempt by Smart Money distribution. We expect a test of demand or immediate follow-through weakness.

**Key Levels:** Climax High/Resistance: 30.10, Immediate Support: 28.95 (Low of BC bar), Key Support Zone: 27.90 - 28.20

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $28.95 (Last week's low) on confirming volume (Short)
- **Invalidation:** $30.15 (Above Climax High)
---
### IREN (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Reversal

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the monthly sequence shows a BUYING_CLIMAX. The preceding weeks showed strong bullish movement on high volume. However, the last bar (2026-01-26) was an extremely wide spread down bar on massive relative volume (1.45x), closing very poorly (CLV -66.8%). This bar aggressively reversed the prior upward momentum (week 2026-01-12/19), marking a clear high-volume reversal, indicating aggressive institutional distribution/supply entry near the $63 level. This is a potential major turning point.

**Key Levels:** Climax High/Resistance: 63.59, Immediate Support: 51.78, Pivot Area: 55.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $51.78 on volume, targeting prior consolidation area.
- **Invalidation:** $63.60 (Above Climax High)
---
### KDP (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Test / Demand Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH, but the Monthly shows BUYING_CLIMAX followed by consolidation. The last three weeks showed tight action with moderate volume. The week of 2026-01-12 was a narrow spread down on moderate volume (0.69x), closing near the low (CLV -82%). This looked like weakness. However, the final week (2026-01-26) was a wide spread up bar on moderate volume (0.83x), closing near the high (CLV 50%). The close near the high on expanding volume, despite the general market weakness, suggests demand is successfully testing and absorbing supply near the $27 area. The monthly bar also closed positively (CLV +6%) on 0.87x RelVol, suggesting accumulation is occurring.

**Key Levels:** Accumulation Support: 26.40 - 27.00, Immediate Resistance: 28.12, Target: 29.60

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $27.80 on confirming volume (Long)
- **Invalidation:** $26.30 (Below recent accumulation lows)
---
### KYMR (BULLISH Watch)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Retracement

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the monthly sequence indicates a possible BUYING_CLIMAX (BCLX in December). The week of 2026-01-12 was a wide spread down on moderate volume (0.7x), closing near the low (CLV -96.4%), which looked like a potential low-volume test or shakeout after the initial BCLX. The last bar (2026-01-26) was a wide spread up bar on high volume (1.06x), closing near the high (CLV 46.9%). This successful recovery on high volume, closing back towards the middle of the recent range, suggests demand has reasserted control following the shakeout. The overall bullish quarterly context supports the interpretation of this being a strong shakeout before continuation.

**Key Levels:** Support: 68.28 (Recent low), Immediate Resistance: 74.30, Target: 77.90 (Monthly high)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $74.30 on confirming volume (Long)
- **Invalidation:** $68.20 (Below recent demand low)
---
### LHX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Major Reversal

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the Weekly sequence shows extreme BUYING_CLIMAX action, leading to a major reversal signal. Weeks 2026-01-05 and 2026-01-12 showed massive up moves on huge volume (1.86x, 2.09x RelVol), confirming climax activity. The final bar (2026-01-26) was a wide spread down bar on very high volume (1.64x), closing near the absolute low (CLV -78.3%). This is a classic high-volume reversal bar after a Buying Climax, signifying that institutional supply has aggressively entered the market and overwhelmed demand. This suggests a significant distribution phase is underway, likely reversing the prior uptrend.

**Key Levels:** Climax High/Resistance: 369.59, Immediate Support: 339.60, Pivot Zone: 345.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $339.60 on volume (Short)
- **Invalidation:** $361.00 (Above recent reaction high)
---
### MAN (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result (Up) / Sign of Strength

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH. The last bar (2026-01-26) was an extremely wide spread up bar on massive relative volume (2.04x), closing right on the high (CLV 99.4%). This is a significant Sign of Strength (SoS), confirming aggressive institutional demand and clearing the supply zone that had been consolidating the price between $29 and $31. The preceding weeks of sideways action on moderate volume suggest consolidation/accumulation (an area of low-volume demand). The breakout on huge volume and wide spread confirms the bullish intent.

**Key Levels:** New Support: 31.50 - 32.00, Immediate Target: New High Territory, Prior Consolidation High: 31.75

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry on a test/pullback to the $33.00 - $34.00 area, or continuation above $36.35.
- **Invalidation:** $31.00 (Below breakout area)
---
### MOD (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Sign of Strength (Breakout) / Stopping Volume Test Failure

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH. The weekly sequence showed Stopping Volume on 2026-01-05 (2.84x RelVol, wide spread down, CLV -20%), which was successfully reversed. The last bar (2026-01-26) was an aggressive, extremely wide spread up bar on massive volume (2.2x RelVol), closing near the high (CLV 78%). This is a massive Sign of Strength (SoS), indicating successful accumulation/absorption of the prior selling climax and a powerful institutional move to new highs. The price broke through the entire range established since the stopping volume bar.

**Key Levels:** Breakout Support: 146.00 (Prior resistance), Immediate Support: 139.25, Target: New High Territory

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry on a test/pullback to $160.00 or $146.00 area.
- **Invalidation:** $139.00 (Below the recent swing low)
---
### NET (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Major Reversal

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH, but a rally attempted to reverse this. The last bar (2026-01-26) was an extremely wide spread bar on massive volume (2.99x RelVol). It was an UP thrust/reversal bar, but it closed near the absolute low (CLV -89.4%). This is a potent reversal signal (Buying Climax followed by immediate weakness/rejection). The high volume suggests massive institutional distribution at the higher prices ($218). This major reversal confirms the resumption of the bearish trend after the attempted rally failed spectacularly.

**Key Levels:** Climax High/Resistance: 218.22, Immediate Support: 175.07, Pivot Area: 180.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $175.00 on volume (Short)
- **Invalidation:** $185.00 (Above recent congestion)
---
### NICE (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Continuation / Rejection

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the Monthly shows SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The last bar (2026-01-26) was a wide spread down bar on high volume (1.22x RelVol), closing near the absolute low (CLV -92.6%). This is a strong weakness signal, suggesting aggressive institutional distribution has taken over, despite the long-term bullish context. The close at the low, combined with the wide spread and high volume, indicates supply is overwhelming demand and breaking prior support near $109-$110.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Resistance: 115.11 (Open of weakness bar), Support: 106.00 (Recent low), Prior Support: 109.30

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $106.00 on volume (Short)
- **Invalidation:** $115.00 (Above recent high)
---
### NXT (BEARISH Watch)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Effort No Result (Up)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the weekly sequence shows climax activity followed by immediate weakness. The week of 2026-01-26 was an extremely wide spread up bar on massive volume (1.89x RelVol), yet it closed poorly (CLV -1.4%), indicating significant supply entering the market (Effort No Result Up/Buying Climax). This bar pierced the $131 level but failed to hold the high ground. This aggressive reversal on high volume suggests institutional distribution, potentially marking the end of the recent rally phase.

**Key Levels:** Climax High/Resistance: 131.58, Immediate Support: 103.00, Pivot Area: 115.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $103.00 (Low of the climax bar) on volume (Short)
- **Invalidation:** $131.60 (Above Climax High)
---
### RF (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Demand Confirmation / Absorption

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH. The Monthly shows SUPPLY_DOMINANCE, but the weekly action suggests demand absorption. The last bar (2026-01-26) was a narrow spread up bar on massive volume (0.96x RelVol), closing near the high (CLV 76%). This strong close on high volume indicates demand is successfully absorbing supply, likely shaking out weak hands from the previous down bar (2026-01-19, CLV -73.5%). The demand response is robust, suggesting Smart Money is accumulating in this region and preparing for a continuation move.

**Key Levels:** Support: 27.25, Immediate Resistance: 28.67, Target: 29.26 (Previous high)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $28.67 on volume (Long)
- **Invalidation:** $27.20 (Below recent low)
---
### RGLD (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Major Reversal

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the recent weekly sequence shows extreme climax activity followed by immediate, aggressive supply. The last bar (2026-01-26) was an extremely wide spread down bar on massive volume (1.48x RelVol), closing near the low (CLV -80.1%). This aggressive reversal comes after three weeks of strong upward movement on high volume, suggesting a major Buying Climax and institutional distribution at the peak ($306.25). This reversal signals a likely end to the intermediate bullish move.

**Key Levels:** Climax High/Resistance: 306.25, Immediate Support: 258.59, Pivot Area: 270.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $258.59 on volume (Short)
- **Invalidation:** $300.00 (Above opening of climax bar)

### RYAAY (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Confirmed)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Weekly chart shows high volume (11.8M, RelVol 2.28) on the most recent bar (Week 4), which closed bullishly in the upper half (CLV 0.61). This action followed three weeks of decline/tightening spreads. The high volume, wide spread, and positive close suggest stopping volume absorbing supply. This confirms the Weekly STOPPING_VOLUME signal. The price is currently testing the 67-68 support zone.

**Key Levels:** 67.41 (Stopping Volume low/Support), 71.96 (Recent Resistance), 74.24 (Quarterly High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry on a successful low-volume Test of Support (67.41-68.50 area) or a break above the prior week's high (71.96) on volume.
- **Invalidation:** Below 67.41 (Invalidates Stopping Volume)
---
### SA (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance/Effort No Result Down

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Weekly chart shows ultra-high volume (11.5M, RelVol 1.74) on a massive wide DOWN bar, closing at the absolute low (CLV -0.97). This is decisive Supply Dominance confirming the Monthly signal. This move shattered the preceding three weeks of consolidation/rally attempts. Smart Money is aggressively selling, likely trapping late buyers who entered during the previous week's rally to 37.99.

**Key Levels:** 28.13 (New Low Support), 36.37 (Prior Support turned Resistance), 37.99 (Distribution Peak)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry on a break below 28.13 or a low-volume minor rally (UTAD) back towards 32.00.
- **Invalidation:** Above 33.00 (Suggests supply failed to maintain control)
---
### SARO (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Weekly chart displays extreme volume (55.2M, RelVol 4.58) on a wide DOWN bar, closing near the low (CLV -0.91). This is extreme Supply Dominance, indicating large institutions are offloading positions, confirmed by the Monthly CLV also at -0.22 (lower half close). This high-volume reversal from the prior week's high (34.47) is bearish, overwhelming prior demand.

**Key Levels:** 30.77 (Recent Low/Potential Support), 34.48 (Supply Peak/Resistance), 28.62 (Monthly Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on a confirmed break below 30.77, targeting monthly lows. Alternatively, short a low-volume rally toward 32.50.
- **Invalidation:** Above 33.00 (Suggests selling failed to break structure)
---
### SATS (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance/Buying Climax Test Failure

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart shows a clear Buying Climax (January) with large volume (150M) and a negative close (CLV -0.54). The most recent Weekly bar exhibits massive volume (49.4M, RelVol 2.06) on a wide DOWN bar, closing firmly in the lower range (CLV -0.67). This is highly bearish Supply Dominance, confirming distribution following the prior climax. The price has clearly failed to hold above the 120 support level.

**Key Levels:** 109.57 (Support Zone), 120.00 (Psychological/Structural Resistance), 132.25 (Climax Peak)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on a rally failure near 120.00, or a decisive break and close below 109.57.
- **Invalidation:** Above 128.00 (Re-entry into distribution territory)
---
### SCZ (BEARISH (Short-term))
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is Bullish, but the last Weekly bar shows extremely high volume (12.3M, RelVol 1.99) on a wide DOWN spread, closing near the low (CLV -0.82). This indicates strong supply entering the market at the top of the range (83.66). This Supply Dominance suggests a likely reversal or significant pullback is starting after a sustained uptrend.

**Key Levels:** 81.58 (Immediate Support), 79.70 (Prior accumulation zone), 83.66 (Supply Peak/Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry upon confirmation of a break below 81.58, or short on a weak rally/low-volume test of 82.50.

### SONY (BEARISH (Trend Continuation))
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Continuation)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Operating within a Bearish Quarterly trend. The last Weekly bar shows extremely high volume (49.8M, RelVol 2.25) on a wide DOWN bar, closing near the low (CLV -0.54). This heavy volume accompanies the breakdown, confirming persistent institutional selling pressure. Price is now trading below the Monthly low (21.79), signaling strong downtrend continuation.

**Key Levels:** 21.80 (Recent Major Low/New Support), 23.93 (Prior Consolidation Low/Resistance), 26.15 (Recent High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on a low-volume retest of 22.50 or a strong continuation breakdown below 21.80.
- **Invalidation:** Above 24.00 (Suggests successful demand entered the market)
---
### SPOT (BEARISH (Continuation))
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Deep Pullback)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Operating within a Bearish Quarterly trend. The Monthly chart shows clear Supply Dominance (CLV -0.84 on high volume). The latest Weekly bar features high volume (10.6M, RelVol 1.16) on a wide down spread, closing in the lower half (CLV -0.47). This confirms the continuation of institutional selling. The recent rally attempt (prior week CLV 0.70) was negated by renewed supply, making 517 a key resistance level.

**Key Levels:** 493.31 (Recent Low Support), 516.98 (Immediate Resistance), 536.13 (Breakdown Level)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on a break below 493.31, confirming the continuation of the downtrend.

---
### STM (BEARISH (Short-term reversal))
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Operating within a Bullish Quarterly trend, but facing severe short-term pressure. The latest Weekly bar shows very high volume (59.3M, RelVol 1.98) on a wide down bar, closing near the low (CLV -0.79). This Supply Dominance wipes out the gains of the prior week's rally (Week 3, CLV 0.73). This suggests strong profit-taking or distribution entering the market, highly likely leading to a deeper pullback.

**Key Levels:** 27.60 (Immediate Support/Demand Test), 29.05 (Prior Close Resistance), 30.41 (Supply Peak)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on a break below 27.60 or a failed rally attempt back toward 29.00 on low volume.
- **Invalidation:** Above 30.41 (Invalidates distribution thesis)
---
### SYF (BEARISH (Trend Continuation))
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Operating within a Bearish Quarterly trend. The Monthly chart shows strong Supply Dominance (CLV -0.90). The latest Weekly bar has extreme high volume (45.6M, RelVol 2.47) on a wide down bar, closing near the low (CLV -0.72). This massive selling confirms institutional liquidation, driving the price below the 75-77 support zone established earlier in the month. This suggests a swift continuation down.

**Key Levels:** 71.86 (New Low Support), 76.61 (Prior Close/Immediate Resistance), 80.19 (Breakdown Failure Level)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on a failed rally back to 74.00, or a continuation breakdown below 71.86.

---
### TFX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax Test Failure / Effort No Result Up

**Smart Money Logic:**
Operating within a Bearish Quarterly trend. The latest Weekly bar shows high volume (6.8M, RelVol 1.93) on a wide bar closing mid-to-low range (CLV -0.29). Although the price attempted to rally (High 106.98), the close near 104.37 shows that the demand effort failed to maintain the rally, confirming supply domination from the prior week's low-volume test (Week 3, CLV -0.06). The monthly chart confirms this reversal with a steep drop on high volume (CLV -0.69).

**Key Levels:** 102.95 (Immediate Support/Recent Low), 107.06 (Recent High/Resistance), 112.81 (Prior Breakdown Level)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on a break and close below 102.95.
- **Invalidation:** Above 107.00 (Suggests demand has returned)
---
### TRU (BEARISH (Continuation))
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance/Test Failure

**Smart Money Logic:**
Operating within a Bearish Quarterly trend. The Monthly chart had a potential Stopping Volume signal (January CLV -0.92, high volume). However, the latest Weekly bar shows high volume (14M, RelVol 1.01) on a wide DOWN spread, closing near the low (CLV -0.87). This indicates that the rally attempt from the prior week (Week 3) was weak and supply has returned aggressively, likely confirming the failure of the monthly stopping volume. This looks like heavy liquidation.

**Key Levels:** 78.60 (New Low Support), 84.19 (Prior consolidation low/Resistance), 87.71 (Rally Peak)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on a break below 78.60 or a low-volume retest of 82.00.
- **Invalidation:** Above 84.16 (Suggests demand is overcoming supply)
---
### TXT (BEARISH (Deep Pullback))
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Operating within a Bullish Quarterly trend but signaling a strong correction. The latest Weekly bar shows very high volume (17.1M, RelVol 2.30) on a wide DOWN spread, closing in the lower half (CLV -0.34). This decisive Supply Dominance strongly rejects the high price of 95.72 and breaks below the recent 92.38 support level (Week 2 low), signaling a significant shift in short-term sentiment toward distribution/profit-taking.

**Key Levels:** 84.32 (Support Zone), 92.38 (Breakdown Resistance), 95.72 (Supply Peak)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on a break below 87.50, or a rally failure back toward 92.00.
- **Invalidation:** Above 95.72 (Invalidates current distribution structure)
---
### UNH (EXTREMELY BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Extreme)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Operating within a Bearish Quarterly trend. The latest Weekly bar shows catastrophic volume (137M, RelVol 3.21) on an ultra-wide DOWN bar, closing near the absolute low (CLV -0.82). This is a historic liquidation event, confirming aggressive institutional dumping. The price has gapped down and broken massive support levels. The prior week's high (357.86) is now an extreme resistance level.

**Key Levels:** 280.40 (New Low Support), 331.02 (Prior Support/Resistance), 357.87 (Liquidation Peak)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on any low-volume minor rally (retest) toward 300.00, or continuation break below 280.40.
- **Invalidation:** Above 340.00 (Unlikely unless a major gap fill occurs)
---
### WGMI (BEARISH (Short-term pullback))
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax Test Failure

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart shows a Buying Climax (January CLV -0.03). The latest Weekly bar shows high volume (5.8M, RelVol 1.48) on a wide down bar, closing near the low (CLV -0.82). This confirms that demand failed decisively after the attempt to push toward 52.00. This is strong evidence of supply taking control and suggests a swift pullback to test the prior rally starting point (around 44.39).

**Key Levels:** 44.39 (Immediate Support), 49.14 (Prior Close Resistance), 52.01 (Supply Peak)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on a confirmed break below 44.39. Alternatively, short a low-volume test of the 47-48 area.
- **Invalidation:** Above 51.00 (Suggests supply was temporary)
---
### WH (BEARISH (Trend Continuation))
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Operating within a Bearish Quarterly trend. The latest Weekly bar shows high volume (11M, RelVol 1.89) on a wide DOWN spread, closing mid-to-low (CLV -0.34). This confirms strong supply, pushing the price lower, confirming the bearish structure established over the past three weeks. The breakdown below 74.00 is significant, targeting new lows in the 68-70 range.

**Key Levels:** 70.59 (New Low Support), 77.30 (Immediate Resistance), 81.37 (Prior High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on a break and close below 70.59.

### WPM (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Extreme)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The latest Weekly bar shows extreme volume (26.9M, RelVol 2.42) on a massive wide DOWN bar, closing near the low (CLV -0.89). This is decisive Supply Dominance, reversing the strong bullish momentum from the previous three weeks, which included a clear Buying Climax (Week 3). This high-volume reversal signals aggressive profit-taking and distribution, shattering recent support levels and potentially starting a significant correction.

**Key Levels:** 130.33 (New Low Support), 146.16 (Prior Support/Resistance), 160.36 (Distribution Peak)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on a break below 130.33, or short a low-volume rally back toward 140.00.

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Low volume test back toward 18.54 followed by upward reversal (Long)
- **Invalidation:** 18.50 (Break of Climax Low)
---
### CRBG (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Low Volume Consolidation / Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
Low volume (RelVol 0.75) and a narrow spread, holding slightly above the previous week's close. This suggests supply has temporarily receded, providing a low volume test of previous demand. Needs confirmation of demand return to negate the bearish quarterly trend.

**Key Levels:** 29.94 (Support), 31.20 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 31.20 (Long)
- **Invalidation:** 29.35 (Previous low)
---
### CVS (BULLISH WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax / Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
Extreme volume (RelVol 2.57) on a very wide spread down bar. Crucially, the close is mid-range (CLV -0.42), showing significant absorption of panic selling (Stopping Volume) at the low (70.69). This is a major character change.

**Key Levels:** 70.69 (Climax Low), 79.27 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Low volume test toward 70.69, or break above 75.50 (Long)
- **Invalidation:** 70.60 (Break of Climax Low)
---
### DOW (BULLISH WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Absorption

**Smart Money Logic:**
High volume (RelVol 1.59) on a down bar, but closing well off the low (CLV 0.26). This is a clear Stopping Volume signal, indicating demand absorption during this reaction, supporting the underlying bullish quarterly trend.

**Key Levels:** 25.81 (Absorption Low), 28.55 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Low volume test toward 26.50 (Long)
- **Invalidation:** 25.80 (Below absorption low)
---
### FCX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Distribution

**Smart Money Logic:**
Extreme volume (RelVol 2.04) on a very wide spread down bar, closing mid-low (CLV -0.70). This marks a significant distribution event following the recent rally into high 69.44. The supply overwhelmed demand, leading to a major reversal.

**Key Levels:** 58.65 (Immediate Support), 69.44 (Distribution High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 58.65 (Short)
- **Invalidation:** 62.13 (Previous high)
---
### FER (NEUTRAL/BULLISH WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Secondary Low Volume Test of Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
Below average volume (RelVol 0.81) on a down bar, suggesting supply is quiet. This low-volume reaction confirms a test of previous resistance (now support). If demand returns next week, the bullish quarterly trend should resume.

**Key Levels:** 67.01 (Test Low), 68.54 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 68.20 on increased volume (Long)
- **Invalidation:** 67.00 (Test low failure)
---
### FFIN (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Extreme volume (RelVol 2.45) on a wide spread down bar, closing mid-low (CLV -0.50). This indicates a strong influx of supply, reversing the bullish momentum from the previous week. This is aggressive profit-taking/distribution in a short-term context.

**Key Levels:** 31.20 (Support), 33.65 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 31.20 (Short)
- **Invalidation:** 32.75 (Previous weak close)
---
### FFIV (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Effort No Result Up

**Smart Money Logic:**
High volume (RelVol 1.84) on an extremely wide spread bar that failed to close strongly (CLV -0.34). This confirms a Buying Climax/Effort No Result, indicating Smart Money distribution at the high (303.98) and a likely immediate correction.

**Key Levels:** 261.85 (Immediate Support), 303.98 (Distribution High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 261.85 on volume (Short)
- **Invalidation:** 303.98 (Failure point)
---
### FHB (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Distribution

**Smart Money Logic:**
High volume (RelVol 2.32) on a down bar, closing mid-low (CLV -0.55). This signals strong supply entry, confirming the bearish pressure suggested by the Monthly Buying Climax status. Price is pulling back hard from the recent high.

**Key Levels:** 26.10 (Support), 28.10 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 26.10 (Short)
- **Invalidation:** 27.12 (Previous open)
---
### FISV (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
High volume (RelVol 1.08) on a wide spread down bar, closing mid-low (CLV -0.59). Supply is dominant, pushing the price lower after a failed rally attempt (Wk 01-19 Demand Confirmation reversed). Short-term weakness against the bullish quarterly trend.

**Key Levels:** 62.66 (Support), 67.91 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 62.66 (Short)
- **Invalidation:** 67.55 (Previous high close)
---
### GKOS (BEARISH WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
Average volume (RelVol 0.96) on a wide spread down bar, closing mid-low (CLV -0.54). Supply has taken control, pushing price lower after failing to capitalize on the rally (Wk 01-12). Bearish confirmation despite the bullish quarterly context.

**Key Levels:** 116.62 (Support), 130.22 (Recent High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 116.60 (Short)
- **Invalidation:** 120.23 (Previous high close)
---
### GNTX (BULLISH WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Absorption

**Smart Money Logic:**
High volume (RelVol 1.65) on a down bar, but closing well off the low (CLV -0.24). This suggests significant buying absorption (Stopping Volume) stepped in at 22.30, defending the accumulation structure in line with the bullish quarterly trend.

**Key Levels:** 22.30 (Absorption Low), 24.15 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 23.50 on increased volume (Long)
- **Invalidation:** 22.30 (Below absorption low)
---
### HBM (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Distribution

**Smart Money Logic:**
Extreme volume (RelVol 1.81) on a very wide spread down bar, closing near the low (CLV -0.87). This is a strong institutional distribution signal, marking a sharp reversal from recent highs, likely leading to a deep correction despite the bullish quarterly context.

**Key Levels:** 23.34 (Support), 28.73 (Distribution High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 23.34 (Short)
- **Invalidation:** 24.96 (Previous high close)
---
### HPE (NEUTRAL/BULLISH Watch)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Monthly/Weekly reaction)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is Bearish, but the Monthly shows STOPPING_VOLUME (Watch for Test). The week of 2026-01-05 saw massive volume (2.8x RelVol) and a wide spread down, closing near the low (CLV -69%), confirming supply but possibly marking initial climax activity. Subsequent weeks showed decreasing spreads and high volume (0.5x, 0.53x, 0.68x RelVol). The last bar (2026-01-26) was a medium spread up bar, closing near the low (CLV +1%), suggesting that high volume selling is still pressuring the price, but the spread narrowed significantly compared to the initial climax. Waiting for a clear test or absorption signal. The monthly bar closed poorly (CLV -33%) on 0.85x RelVol, confirming overall weakness, but the weekly sequence suggests short-term demand emerging near $21.50.

**Key Levels:** Major Support: 20.07 (Weekly Low), Resistance: 22.71 (Recent Weekly High), Stopping Volume Area: 21.76 - 22.17

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Clear Test of 21.00 or break above 22.20 on high volume (Long)
- **Invalidation:** $20.00 (Below recent lows)
---
### HUM (BEARISH (Extreme Volatility))
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax / Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH, and the weekly action confirms an intense continuation of this trend. The last week (2026-01-26) saw an extreme wide spread down bar on massive volume (3.4x RelVol), closing near the absolute low (CLV -90%). This bar represents an intense SELLING CLIMAX (SC). While SC often precedes a rally, the extreme nature and the massive gap down suggest institutional panic or fundamental change. Given the bearish quarterly context, this SC needs a significant test/response. Until then, extreme bearish pressure dominates. The monthly bar closed extremely poorly (CLV -91%) on 1.2x RelVol, confirming the SC.

**Key Levels:** Extreme SC Low: 191.38, Immediate Resistance: 264.85 (Open of SC bar), Prior Support Zone: 260.00 - 270.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Only enter short if resistance near 260 fails a minor rally/test. Wait for consolidation above 191.38 for any long consideration.
- **Invalidation:** $277.00 (Above prior resistance/weekly high)
---
### IMAX (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Weak Rally

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH, but the Monthly shows STOPPING_VOLUME. The week of 2026-01-12 showed a wide spread up bar on high volume (1.22x), closing near the high (CLV 90%), marking the stopping volume demand. However, the subsequent week (2026-01-19) immediately reversed, showing a wide spread down on moderate volume (0.75x), closing near the low (CLV -82%), indicating immediate rejection/supply re-entry. The last week (2026-01-26) was a narrow spread up bar on moderate volume (0.75x), closing near the high (CLV 50%). This suggests a temporary pause or very weak demand response after the previous supply bar. This pattern indicates supply is still dominant, neutralizing the earlier stopping volume signal.

**Key Levels:** Resistance/Supply: 37.50, Support: 33.00 - 33.70, Recent Low: 33.70

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $37.50 (Long) or failure of $33.70 (Short)
- **Invalidation:** $33.00 (Below recent stopping action low)
---
### INVH (NEUTRAL/BULLISH Watch)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Confirmed Early) / Weak Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH, but the Weekly sequence triggered a CONFIRMED_EARLY STOPPING_VOLUME. The week of 2026-01-05 saw massive volume (2.56x RelVol) and a wide spread down, closing near the low (CLV -20%). This was followed immediately by a strong bullish response (2026-01-12): wide spread up on high volume (1.26x) closing near the high (CLV 98.8%), confirming demand absorption and a potential reversal from the stopping volume area ($25.29). However, the last week (2026-01-26) was a wide spread down bar on high volume (1.58x), closing near the middle/low (CLV -3.9%), representing a weak test of the reaction high ($27.65) and a minor relapse. Demand must reappear immediately to hold the reversal.

**Key Levels:** Stopping Volume Low: 25.29, Immediate Support: 26.12, Resistance: 27.78

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Reversal above $27.00 or break above $27.80 on volume (Long)
- **Invalidation:** $26.00 (Below recent reaction low)
---
### IONX (BEARISH (Extreme Weakness))
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax / Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH, and the Weekly sequence confirms SUPPLY_DOMINANCE leading to a massive markdown. The week of 2026-01-19 showed high volume (1.62x RelVol) and a wide spread down, closing poorly (CLV -63%). The final week (2026-01-26) intensified this selling pressure with an extreme wide spread down bar on huge volume (2.41x RelVol), closing near the low (CLV -83%). This is a major Selling Climax (SC) signal, indicating panic selling and a likely capitulation event, consistent with the overall bearish context. The price broke aggressively below $20.

**Key Levels:** SC Low: 15.21, Immediate Resistance: 23.90 (Open of SC bar), Prior Support: 21.51

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for confirmation of weakness below $15.20 if the bearish trend continues, or for a strong reversal pattern off the SC low for long opportunity.
- **Invalidation:** $24.00 (Above SC open)
---
### ITT (NEUTRAL/BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result (Up) / High Volume Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH, but recent monthly action suggests absorption (Jan CLV 28% on 1.5x RelVol). The week of 2026-01-19 was a wide spread up bar on moderate volume (0.82x), closing poorly (CLV 1.7%), suggesting effort without result (supply present). However, the last week (2026-01-26) was also a wide spread up bar on high volume (1.25x), closing near the middle (CLV 9%), indicating demand is still active but facing resistance. This sequence looks like a test of supply above $180. The fact that the price holds $182 suggests demand is absorbing the recent supply, potentially leading to a spring or sign of strength.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Resistance: 187.65, Support Zone: 178.08 - 180.00, Key Low: 172.72

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $188.00 on increasing volume (Long)
- **Invalidation:** $178.00 (Below recent weekly low)
---
### JPM (NEUTRAL/BULLISH Watch)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Low Volume Test Failed

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH, and the Weekly sequence is flagged for SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. Weeks 2026-01-12 and 2026-01-19 saw massive selling (1.99x and 1.0x RelVol respectively), confirming significant supply and breaking strong support ($310). The last bar (2026-01-26) was a wide spread up bar on high volume (1.4x), closing near the high (CLV 61%). This looks like a demand response following the capitulation/selling climax from the prior two weeks. The high volume on the up close suggests demand is aggressive in pushing price away from the $297 low. This is a potential minor Sign of Strength (SoS).

**Key Levels:** Support/Demand Zone: 296.51 - 300.00, Immediate Resistance: 312.50, Overhead Supply: 320.00 - 325.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Continuation above $307.00 (Long)
- **Invalidation:** $296.00 (Below recent lows)
---
### KEY (NEUTRAL/BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Absorption

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the Monthly shows SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The last three weeks saw moderate volume and tight spreads, indicating consolidation after a previous move up. The bar ending 2026-01-19 was a wide spread down on moderate volume (0.75x), closing near the middle (CLV -2.1%). This followed a successful demand test in the prior week. The final bar (2026-01-26) was a narrow spread up on high volume (0.96x), closing near the high (CLV 27%). This suggests accumulation or absorption of selling pressure is successful, maintaining the uptrend despite the high volume. The bullish quarterly trend supports this interpretation.

**Key Levels:** Support Zone: 20.55 - 21.05, Immediate Resistance: 21.78, Target: 22.07 (Previous high)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $21.80 on volume (Long)
- **Invalidation:** $20.50 (Below recent consolidation low)
---
### MSFU (BEARISH (Extreme Weakness))
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax / Supply Continuation

**Smart Money Logic:**
Both Quarterly and Monthly trends are BEARISH. The weekly action confirms aggressive markdown. The last bar (2026-01-26) was an extremely wide spread down bar on massive volume (6.5x RelVol), closing near the absolute low (CLV -68.8%). This is a classic Selling Climax (SC) signal, indicating panic and capitulation. The size of the spread and volume suggests major institutional abandonment, aggressively breaking through the prior $33-$36 support zone. Given the deep bearish context, immediate rallies are likely to be met with further supply.

**Key Levels:** SC Low: 30.43, Immediate Resistance: 38.00 (Open of weakness bar), Prior Support: 33.85

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for bearish confirmation below $30.40 or failed test rally.
- **Invalidation:** $38.50 (Above recent congestion high)
---
### NUE (NEUTRAL/BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Demand Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH. The week of 2026-01-05 was a down bar on high volume (1.22x), closing poorly (CLV -55.6%), marking a potential shakeout or stopping volume. This was followed by two strong demand bars (CLV 76%, 76%). The final bar (2026-01-26) was a wide spread bar on high volume (1.9x RelVol), closing near the middle (CLV 36%). This bar attempted to break higher but saw some supply entering above $180, leading to the close off the highs. This suggests Smart Money is testing the previous highs. Given the strong demand signals in the preceding weeks, the pressure remains bullish, absorbing the supply.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Support: 177.00, Resistance: 183.32 (Recent High), Demand Zone: 171.70 - 172.50

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $183.50 on increasing volume (Long)
- **Invalidation:** $176.00 (Below last week's middle/low)
---
### OC (NEUTRAL/BEARISH Watch)
**VSA Status:** Supply Test / Weakness

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the Monthly shows STOPPING_VOLUME, suggesting a potential top area. The preceding weeks showed strong demand. The last bar (2026-01-26) was a wide spread down bar on high volume (1.4x RelVol), closing poorly (CLV -29.6%). This is the strongest weekly supply signal since the massive demand bar on 2026-01-05. The high volume confirms institutional selling pressure is overwhelming the recent demand and suggests a test of the lower range is likely. The price has failed to hold above $125.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 126.90, Immediate Support: 116.88, Demand Zone: 110.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $116.88 on volume (Short)
- **Invalidation:** $125.30 (Above last week's high)
---
### OZK (NEUTRAL/BULLISH Watch)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Demand Response

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the Weekly sequence flagged for SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The week of 2026-01-19 was a wide spread down bar on high volume (2.05x RelVol), closing near the low (CLV -91.3%), a strong sign of weakness/shakeout. However, the next bar (2026-01-26) was a wide spread up bar on high volume (1.38x), closing near the high (CLV 69.9%). This aggressive demand response, absorbing the supply from the prior week, suggests the selling was a shakeout rather than a full reversal. Given the bullish Quarterly trend, this absorption is a bullish development.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Support: 45.64, Resistance: 48.47 (Previous high), Demand Zone: 45.77 - 46.08

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $48.50 on volume (Long)
- **Invalidation:** $45.60 (Below the shakeout low)
---
### PB (NEUTRAL/BEARISH Watch)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Reversal Failure

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH. The week of 2026-01-26 was an extremely wide spread down bar on massive volume (2.69x RelVol), closing near the middle/low (CLV -4.4%). This is a strong Stopping Volume bar, confirming institutional selling pressure or a shakeout, breaking sharply below the $71-$72 consolidation. The preceding week showed supply confirmation (CLV -86.6% on 0.65x RelVol). Given the bearish close of the SC bar, demand has not yet stepped in strongly to lift the price. We need confirmation that this is a shakeout before assuming continuation of the bullish trend.

**Key Levels:** SC Low: 65.12, Immediate Resistance: 72.04 (Open of SC bar), Pivot Area: 70.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Strong demand response off $65.12 (Long) or break below $65.00 (Short)
- **Invalidation:** $72.10 (Above SC open/prior support)
---
### PSN (NEUTRAL/BEARISH Watch)
**VSA Status:** Supply Continuation / Weakness

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH, with strong Monthly SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The week of 2026-01-05 showed a strong rally (SoS, CLV 97% on 1.4x RelVol) suggesting demand entry. However, demand failed to follow through, and the subsequent bars showed struggle and weakness. The final bar (2026-01-26) was a wide spread down bar on moderate volume (0.99x), closing near the low (CLV -57%). This failure to maintain high prices, coupled with the immediate reversal after the demand signal, indicates that supply is still dominant, likely marking a successful test of overhead supply around $72-$74.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Resistance: 73.26, Support: 69.18 (Recent low), Supply Zone: 72.73 - 74.62

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $69.18 on volume (Short)
- **Invalidation:** $73.30 (Above recent high)
---
### PTGX (NEUTRAL/BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Demand Confirmation / Absorption

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH, but the Monthly shows a BUYING_CLIMAX that likely led to consolidation. The recent action shows stability after a sharp drop (2026-01-05, CLV -75%). The last bar (2026-01-26) was a narrow spread up bar on moderate volume (0.98x RelVol), closing near the high (CLV 24%). This bar, following a successful test of demand near $79-$81, suggests accumulation is occurring and demand is absorbing supply, despite the bearish quarterly context. The market appears to be forming a base above $77.69.

**Key Levels:** Support: 77.69 (Recent low), Immediate Resistance: 84.31, Pivot Area: 85.50

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $84.50 on volume (Long)
- **Invalidation:** $77.50 (Below recent accumulation low)
---
### RARE (NEUTRAL/BEARISH Watch)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Weak Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH, with continuous Monthly SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The initial selling climax (2025-12-29) was met with immediate, but weak, demand. The last bar (2026-01-26) was a narrow spread down bar on high volume (1.4x RelVol), closing near the low (CLV -6.8%). This bar attempted to break higher but was rejected, indicating supply remains heavy near the $24.50-$25.00 zone. The high volume on the narrow range and poor close suggests successful supply absorption of the attempted minor rally (climax test).

**Key Levels:** Immediate Resistance: 25.00, Support: 23.26, Key Low: 22.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $23.26 on volume (Short)
- **Invalidation:** $25.00 (Above recent high)
---
### RVMD (BEARISH (Short-term pullback likely))
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax/Effort No Result

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart shows a clear Buying Climax (January) with extreme high volume (116M) resulting in a wide spread but a close in the lower portion (CLV -0.14). The most recent Weekly bar shows extreme high volume (23.5M, RelVol 1.62) on a wide DOWN bar, closing near the low (CLV -0.05). This is classic Selling Pressure/Effort No Result (selling effort fails to keep the price down significantly, but the momentum is lost). The prior momentum (Week 2 of Jan) saw a massive Buying Climax (RelVol 4.2) on an ultra-wide bar. This looks like a distribution phase following peak excitement. Price broke down sharply from 120 key level.

**Key Levels:** 92.50 (Recent Weekly Low Support), 113.33 (Prior consolidation low), 124.50 (All-time High/Climax Peak)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a sign of strength (SOS) or spring test near 92.50, or break below 92.50 for short continuation.
- **Invalidation:** Above 120.00 (Suggests demand is still powerful)
---
### RYN (NEUTRAL/BULLISH bias (Watch for bounce))
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax/Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Weekly chart shows extreme high volume (47.3M, RelVol 5.14) on a wide down bar, closing in the lower half (CLV -0.20). This volume is climactic and suggests heavy liquidation and absorption. It acts as a potential Selling Climax, marking the culmination of the prior move down from the Monthly Buying Climax (January CLV -0.20, very high volume). This high volume usually signals a turn or at least a temporary floor. Price is entering a potential accumulation zone.

**Key Levels:** 21.90 (Climactic Low Support), 24.82 (Recent High/Monthly Climax), 23.50 (Recent resistance area)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a secondary Test (ST) of the 21.90-22.50 area on reduced volume.
- **Invalidation:** Below 21.89 (Indicates weak demand or poor stopping volume effect)
---
### STAA (NEUTRAL/BULLISH bias (Weak stopping action))
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Weekly chart shows a wide spread down bar two weeks ago (Week 3 of Jan) on above-average volume (5.6M, RelVol 0.96) closing near the low (CLV -0.92), confirming strong supply. However, the latest weekly bar (Week 4) is very narrow spread with reduced volume (5.2M, RelVol 0.86), closing mid-range (CLV -0.42). While volume decreased, the lack of an immediate SOS suggests supply remains in control, though the selling intensity has dropped. Given the Bearish Quarterly trend, this Stopping Volume is weak and needs strong confirmation.

**Key Levels:** 18.67 (Stopping Volume low), 21.27 (Immediate Resistance), 22.12 (Prior Rally Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Long entry only on a definitive Sign of Strength (SOS) breaking above 21.27 on high volume. Otherwise, look for short continuation below 18.67.
- **Invalidation:** Below 18.67 (Confirms continued bearish trend)
---
### UGI (NEUTRAL/BEARISH bias (Reversal signal))
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Effort No Result Up

**Smart Money Logic:**
The latest Weekly bar displays extremely high volume (30.5M, RelVol 2.79) on a very wide UP bar. However, the close is near the middle/low portion (CLV -0.02), indicating substantial supply absorption at the high (41.34). This is a classic Buying Climax or Effort No Result Up, suggesting institutional selling is overwhelming the market strength at this peak. Given the prior strong rally (Week 3 CLV 0.89), this suggests a potential reversal or significant consolidation is imminent.

**Key Levels:** 38.95 (Immediate Support), 41.34 (Climax Peak/Resistance), 37.00 (Prior Support Zone)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on a break and close below 38.95 on confirming volume.
- **Invalidation:** Above 41.34 (Suggests the climax was merely a breakout)
---
### USIG (NEUTRAL/BEARISH bias)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Range Bound)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Weekly chart shows high volume (11.1M, RelVol 1.23) on a narrow DOWN bar, closing mid-to-low range (CLV -0.25). Given the extremely tight range (0.24 spread), the high volume is significant. This indicates strong supply absorbing demand near the 52.11 high. Although the Quarterly trend is bullish, the persistent supply signals (three of the last five weeks showing low CLV on high volume) suggest a lack of conviction for a breakout.

**Key Levels:** 51.87 (Immediate Support), 52.12 (Range Resistance), 51.65 (Consolidation Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on a break below 51.65. Long entry on a breakout above 52.12 on high volume.
- **Invalidation:** Above 52.12 (For short setup) / Below 51.65 (For potential long setup)

### VONG (NEUTRAL/BEARISH bias)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Operating within a Bearish Quarterly trend. The Monthly chart shows potential Stopping Volume (January CLV -0.19). However, the latest Weekly bar shows high volume (17.8M, RelVol 1.78) on a wide down bar, closing mid-to-low (CLV -0.28). This suggests renewed selling pressure, invalidating the bullish sentiment from the previous week's rally (Week 3 CLV 0.70). Supply is reasserting control within the consolidation range.

**Key Levels:** 118.66 (Support/Test Level), 120.94 (Immediate Resistance), 123.60 (Range High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a low-volume Test (ST) of 118.66 for a long opportunity, or a high-volume break below 118.66 for a short continuation.
- **Invalidation:** Below 118.66 (Invalidates mid-range support)
---
### WHR (NEUTRAL/BULLISH bias (Cautious))
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Weak)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Weekly chart shows extremely high volume (18.3M, RelVol 2.58) on an ultra-wide down bar, but the close is significantly off the low, closing in the upper portion (CLV 0.11). This suggests Stopping Volume, where demand entered the market aggressively to absorb the selling pressure. Although the trend is currently bullish quarterly, the weekly selling climax (Week 3 CLV -0.51) and the wide spread down indicate underlying supply. A test is necessary to confirm demand strength.

**Key Levels:** 72.55 (Stopping Volume Low), 85.43 (Immediate Resistance), 90.21 (Supply Peak)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Long entry on a successful, low-volume Test (ST) near the 72.55 level, or a clear Sign of Strength (SOS) break above 85.43.
- **Invalidation:** Below 72.55 (Confirms supply continuation)
---
### WRB (NEUTRAL/BEARISH bias)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result Down (Weakness)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Operating within a Bearish Quarterly trend. The latest Weekly bar shows high volume (16.6M, RelVol 1.19) on a wide spread, but the close is off the low, mid-range (CLV 0.45). This suggests some demand absorption (Stopping Volume effect), but given the preceding bearish sequence and the bearish quarterly trend, this appears to be weak Effort No Result Down, likely indicating a pause before continued weakness. The rally failed to retake 69.91.

**Key Levels:** 65.02 (Recent Low Support), 69.92 (Immediate Resistance), 71.08 (Prior High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a clear Sign of Strength (SOS) above 70.00. Short entry on a failure to hold 65.02.
- **Invalidation:** Above 71.08 (Suggests reversal underway)
---
### ZM (NEUTRAL/BEARISH bias (Reversal Potential))
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Effort No Result Up

**Smart Money Logic:**
The latest Weekly bar shows extremely high volume (31.4M, RelVol 2.22) on a wide UP bar, but the close is near the middle/low portion (CLV 0.01). This is classic Effort No Result or a Buying Climax. Significant supply entered the market at the high (97.58), absorbing institutional demand. This action usually signals the end of the short-term rally and the start of consolidation or a pullback, despite the bullish quarterly trend.

**Key Levels:** 86.40 (Immediate Support/Demand Test), 97.58 (Climax Peak/Resistance), 80.58 (Prior Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on a break and close below 86.40 on confirming volume. Long entry on a low-volume test of the 85.00 support area.
- **Invalidation:** Above 97.58 (Suggests further price expansion)

---
### HDB (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Effort No Result (Down)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly context is BEARISH. The Weekly sequence shows persistent SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The last week (2026-01-26) was a narrow spread up bar on high relative volume (1.6x), closing near the middle. This is confusing/weak, potentially hiding selling pressure or a minor pause. However, the preceding weeks showed wide spread down bars on very high volume (2.8x, 1.2x), indicating significant markdown (climax selling in early Jan). The monthly bar for Jan closed poorly (-61% CLV) on massive volume (1.3x RelVol), confirming major supply entry and breaking key monthly support around $35. The current weekly pause ($32.38) is likely a temporary recovery before the next leg down, consistent with a bearish monthly close.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 33.50 (Recent high/old weekly low), Supply Zone: 35.00 - 36.00, Support: 31.34 (Monthly low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $32.00 on increasing volume (Short)
- **Invalidation:** $33.60 (Above recent high spread)
---
### HPQ (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result (Down)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Both Quarterly and Monthly trends are dominated by Supply. The weekly action confirms this. The last two weeks saw moderate spreads down/sideways with high relative volume (1.1x and 1.57x RelVol). The bar ending 2026-01-19 was a down bar, closing poorly (CLV -57%) on high volume, indicating significant effort to push lower with little result, but still weak. The last bar (2026-01-26) was a narrow spread up close near the middle/high (CLV +38%) on very high volume (1.57x RelVol). This suggests demand attempted to step in, but given the strong bearish context, this is likely a temporary reaction or supply re-entering near $19.60-$20.00 after a failed low test. Overall, the market remains firmly under distribution pressure.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 20.65 (Recent Support/Resistance), Supply Zone: 21.50 - 22.00, Support: 18.94 (Recent low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $18.90 on high volume (Short)
- **Invalidation:** $20.40 (Above reaction highs)
---
### IONQ (BEARISH (Intense Supply))
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax / Supply Continuation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH, and the Monthly sequence showed a BUYING_CLIMAX that has failed. The last week (2026-01-26) was an extremely wide spread down bar on massive volume (1.2x RelVol), closing near the absolute low (CLV -81.7%). This represents a massive markdown and selling climax, breaking previous reaction lows. The high volume confirms institutional selling pressure is overwhelming any demand. This is a severe weakness signal, indicating a major capitulation phase or continuation of a deeply bearish trend, accelerating below the prior $45-$47 range.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Resistance: 48.31 (Open of SC bar), SC Low: 38.91, Prior Support Zone: 46.00 - 47.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $38.90 (Short, extremely high volatility) or wait for a strong bullish test confirmation before considering long.
- **Invalidation:** $48.50 (Above recent congestion)
---
### IOT (BEARISH (Severe Weakness))
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result (Down) / Supply Continuation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH, and the Monthly sequence showed a potential Buying Climax that has resulted in aggressive supply continuation. The week of 2026-01-26 was an extremely wide spread down bar on high volume (1.69x RelVol), closing near the absolute low (CLV -91.7%). This is a severe weakness signal. The previous week's volume (1.03x) was already high on a down bar, confirming pressure. The market is accelerating its markdown phase, breaking below critical support near $31-$32.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Resistance: 32.29 (Open of weakness bar), Support: 27.84 (Recent low), Prior Support: 31.25

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $27.80 on volume (Short)
- **Invalidation:** $33.00 (Above recent minor resistance)
---
### KVYO (BEARISH (Intense Supply))
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax / Supply Continuation

**Smart Money Logic:**
Both Quarterly and Monthly trends are Bearish, compounded by recent Selling Climax (SC) signals. The week of 2026-01-12 showed extreme supply (CLV -96.7% on 1.02x RelVol). The market attempted a rally (2026-01-19, CLV 40% on 0.84x RelVol), which was immediately met by overwhelming supply in the final bar (2026-01-26). This last bar was a wide spread down on high volume (1.17x), closing near the absolute low (CLV -91.8%). This sequence confirms that the initial SC failed to attract strong demand, and the selling pressure is resuming aggressively, likely breaking the SC low soon.

**Key Levels:** SC Low: 22.03, Immediate Resistance: 25.80, Overhead Supply: 28.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $22.00 on confirming volume (Short)
- **Invalidation:** $25.80 (Above recent high/consolidation area)
---
### LQDA (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Demand Absorption / Sign of Strength

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH, and the Monthly is marked by CONFIRMED_EARLY SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (a previous bearish signal now likely absorbed). The weekly action shows persistent demand. The last three bars are up bars on increasing volume (1.25x, 0.72x, 1.02x RelVol) and strong closes. The final bar (2026-01-26) was a wide spread up bar on high volume (1.02x), closing near the high (CLV 17.5%), successfully pushing through prior resistance and holding the high ground. The price has rallied strongly from the $30 low, demonstrating robust institutional demand (Sign of Strength) and overcoming the reported monthly supply.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Support: 40.00, Resistance/Target: 44.27 (Recent High), Key Support: 37.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $44.30 on volume (Long)
- **Invalidation:** $39.70 (Below recent low)
---
### NFXL (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH. The week of 2026-01-19 showed high volume (3.33x RelVol) and a wide spread down, closing near the middle (CLV -0.6%), marking Stopping Volume. However, the subsequent test/rally was extremely weak. The final bar (2026-01-26) was a wide spread down bar on high volume (1.6x), closing poorly (CLV -53.7%). This confirms the supply remains dominant, pushing the price back down immediately after the brief demand signal. The price is likely headed toward the low of the stopping volume bar ($23.14) or lower.

**Key Levels:** Stopping Volume Low: 23.14, Immediate Resistance: 26.00, Supply Zone: 27.00 - 28.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $23.10 on volume (Short)
- **Invalidation:** $26.05 (Above last weekly high)
---
### OKLO (BEARISH (Extreme Weakness))
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Supply Continuation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH. The week of 2026-01-05 saw a massive Buying Climax (BCLX) (115.72 high, 1.18x RelVol, CLV 41%), followed immediately by failure. The last two bars (2026-01-19 and 2026-01-26) show aggressive weakness resuming. The final bar was a wide spread down bar on high volume (0.85x RelVol), closing near the low (CLV -91.2%). This confirms the BCLX has failed and distribution is accelerating, potentially marking the end of the short-term rally and resuming the overall bearish trend. The monthly bar closed poorly (CLV -65%) on 0.96x RelVol, confirming the distribution.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Resistance: 86.18 (Open of weakness bar), SC Low: 78.91, Climax High: 115.72

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $78.90 on volume (Short)
- **Invalidation:** $86.50 (Above open of last bar)
---
### ONB (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Demand Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH. Although the Monthly showed CONFIRMED_EARLY SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (likely absorbed lower down), the weekly action is now robustly bullish. The last bar (2026-01-26) was a narrow spread up bar on high volume (1.08x RelVol), closing near the high (CLV 82.7%). This is a strong demand signal, confirming upward momentum and overcoming the mid-January supply test (2026-01-19, CLV -29.8%). The market is showing signs of strength (SoS) and is preparing to move into new high territory, aligning with the bullish quarterly trend.

**Key Levels:** New Support: 23.37 (Recent low), Immediate Resistance: 24.78 (Recent high), Target: New High Territory

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $24.78 on confirming volume (Long)
- **Invalidation:** $23.35 (Below recent demand low)
---
### OTIS (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Continuation / Weakness

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH, and the Weekly sequence flagged for SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The last bar (2026-01-26) was an extremely wide spread down bar on massive volume (2.4x RelVol), closing near the low (CLV -62.9%). This is a powerful weakness signal, confirming institutional distribution is aggressive and is successfully marking down the price, breaking below the strong congestion area near $87-$91. This aggressive supply move, consistent with the bearish Quarterly context, suggests further downside is highly likely.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Resistance: 91.19 (Open of weakness bar), Support: 84.00 (Recent low), Prior Support: 87.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $84.00 on volume (Short)
- **Invalidation:** $88.00 (Above recent reaction high)
---
### PAGP (NEUTRAL/BEARISH Watch)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Weak Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the Weekly sequence shows a BUYING_CLIMAX developing. The preceding two weeks showed narrow spread up movement on high volume, closing near the high (CLV 81-94%), indicating continued demand. The final bar (2026-01-26) was a wide spread up bar on huge volume (1.92x RelVol), yet it closed poorly (CLV -27.3%). This is a clear Effort No Result Up signal, indicating aggressive supply entering the market at the top of the range ($21.19). This climactic behavior suggests the current rally is vulnerable to a reversal/test.

**Key Levels:** Climax High/Resistance: 21.19, Immediate Support: 20.07, Key Support: 19.47

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $20.07 on volume (Short)
- **Invalidation:** $21.20 (Above Climax High)
---
### PEGA (BEARISH (Extreme Weakness))
**VSA Status:** Supply Continuation / Selling Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH, reinforced by consistent SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The last bar (2026-01-26) was an extremely wide spread down bar on massive volume (1.95x RelVol), closing near the absolute low (CLV -93.9%). This is an intense Selling Climax (SC) and a major weakness signal, aggressively breaking the recent support area near $50. The preceding weeks also showed strong supply, confirming the acceleration of the markdown phase, consistent with the bearish monthly and quarterly context.

**Key Levels:** SC Low: 43.45, Immediate Resistance: 50.40 (Open of weakness bar), Prior Support: 51.30

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $43.40 on volume (Short) or failed rally test.

### PGY (BEARISH (Extreme Weakness))
**VSA Status:** Supply Continuation / Selling Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH, and the Monthly shows SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The last bar (2026-01-26) was a wide spread down bar on high volume (1.01x RelVol), closing near the absolute low (CLV -82.9%). This is a strong weakness signal, confirming the aggressive continuation of the bearish trend and breaking the recent consolidation lows. The price failed to sustain the earlier rally (2026-01-05), indicating persistent supply presence, consistent with the overall distribution pattern.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Resistance: 21.97 (Open of weakness bar), SC Low: 19.12, Prior Low: 20.62

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $19.10 on volume (Short)

---
### QQQI (NEUTRAL/BEARISH Watch)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Weakness

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH. The monthly shows a BUYING_CLIMAX. The last bar (2026-01-26) was a wide spread up bar on high volume (1.35x RelVol), but it closed poorly (CLV -51.5%). This is an Effort No Result Up signal, indicating supply has entered aggressively at the high ($54.67), despite the bullish context. This is a crucial warning sign, suggesting the upward momentum is being arrested by institutional distribution.

**Key Levels:** Climax High/Resistance: 54.67, Immediate Support: 53.56, Key Support: 52.92

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $53.56 on volume (Short)
- **Invalidation:** $54.70 (Above Climax High)
---
### QRVO (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Continuation / Weakness

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH, and the Weekly sequence confirms persistent SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The price has been under consistent supply pressure since the high-volume down bar on 2026-01-05. The last bar (2026-01-26) was a wide spread down bar on massive volume (1.89x RelVol), closing poorly (CLV -39%). This indicates aggressive selling and a breakdown from the $80-$84 consolidation zone. This strong weakness signal, consistent with the long-term bearish context, suggests further markdown is imminent.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Resistance: 80.83 (Open of weakness bar), Support: 75.70 (Recent low), Supply Zone: 82.00 - 84.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $75.70 on volume (Short)

---
### QTWO (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Continuation / Weakness

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH, and the Monthly sequence confirms CONFIRMED_EARLY SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The last bar (2026-01-26) was an extremely wide spread down bar on high volume (1.26x RelVol), closing near the low (CLV -77.8%). This is a very strong weakness signal, accelerating the markdown phase. While the previous bar showed a demand response (CLV 95.7%), it was immediately rejected by overwhelming supply, confirming the dominance of institutional sellers, consistent with the bearish monthly action.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Resistance: 68.67 (Open of weakness bar), Support: 60.24 (Recent low), Prior Support: 64.88

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $60.24 on volume (Short)
- **Invalidation:** $69.36 (Above last week's high)
---
### RBLX (BEARISH (Extreme Weakness))
**VSA Status:** Supply Continuation / Selling Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH. The price saw a strong effort to rally (2026-01-12, SoS, CLV 58% on 2.05x RelVol), which failed immediately upon hitting major supply, confirming overhead distribution. The last bar (2026-01-26) was a wide spread down bar on massive volume (2.32x RelVol), closing near the low (CLV -79.5%). This is an aggressive Selling Climax/Supply Continuation bar, overwhelming the earlier demand and confirming the resumption of the markdown phase, consistent with the overall bearish context.

**Key Levels:** SC Low: 64.54, Immediate Resistance: 73.25 (Open of weakness bar), Prior Support: 71.78

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $64.50 on volume (Short)

### RGTI (BEARISH (Extreme Weakness))
**VSA Status:** Supply Continuation / Selling Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH. The market failed to hold its previous rally efforts, confirming strong underlying supply. The final bar (2026-01-26) was an extremely wide spread down bar on high volume (0.59x RelVol, which is high volume given the context of massive prior volume), closing near the low (CLV -82.2%). This marks an aggressive markdown and potentially a Selling Climax, confirming the inability of demand to maintain price above $23. The monthly data confirms intense weakness (CLV -87.9%). The price broke below key psychological support near $20.

**Key Levels:** SC Low: 17.62, Immediate Resistance: 23.43 (Open of weakness bar), Prior Support: 22.40

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $17.60 on volume (Short)
- **Invalidation:** $23.50 (Above recent open/resistance)

### RKT (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Continuation / Weakness

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH, and the Monthly shows SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The strong rally in early January (2026-01-05, CLV 92% on 1.3x RelVol) failed immediately upon testing previous highs, confirming overhead supply. The last bar (2026-01-26) was a wide spread down bar on massive volume (1.5x RelVol), closing poorly (CLV -59.3%). This is a strong weakness signal, breaking the recent consolidation lows and confirming the resumption of the markdown phase, consistent with the long-term bearish context.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Resistance: 20.89 (Open of weakness bar), Support: 17.04 (Recent low), Pivot Area: 19.80

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $17.00 on volume (Short)
- **Invalidation:** $21.40 (Above recent swing high)

### RLI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Continuation / Weakness

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH. The Monthly sequence showed a BUYING_CLIMAX followed by SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The last bar (2026-01-26) was a wide spread up bar on huge volume (1.9x RelVol), but it closed near the middle (CLV 19.6%). In this context, the wide spread and high volume on a mediocre close strongly suggest heavy supply is entering (Effort No Result Up), arresting the rally. This follows several weeks of confirmed supply dominance (2026-01-05 and 2026-01-19). The market is failing to hold the high ground despite intense effort, confirming distribution.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Resistance: 59.45, Support: 56.90, Key Support: 55.80

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $58.00 on volume (Short)
- **Invalidation:** $59.50 (Above last week's high)

### RTO (NEUTRAL/BEARISH Watch)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Weakness

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH. The week of 2026-01-19 showed an up bar on high volume (2.51x RelVol), closing near the high (CLV 83.9%), marking a strong Sign of Strength/possible Climax. The next bar (2026-01-26) was a wide spread down bar on very high volume (1.71x RelVol), closing poorly (CLV -78.8%). This is a strong reversal signal (Effort No Result Down), indicating supply has entered aggressively at the top of the range ($33.45), overwhelming demand. This suggests a significant test of the prior demand area ($31) is coming.

**Key Levels:** Climax High/Resistance: 33.45, Immediate Support: 31.28, Demand Zone: 30.60

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $31.28 on volume (Short)
- **Invalidation:** $33.50 (Above Climax High)
