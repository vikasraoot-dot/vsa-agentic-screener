## 🚀 Ready for Entry
### ACN (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Test/No Supply (following Stopping Volume)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Institutional demand stepped in heavily on 01/05 (Stopping Volume/Absorption) following the sharp drop. The subsequent down move (01/19) occurred on significantly low volume (RelVol 0.43), indicating supply exhaustion. This is a high-probability low-risk test structure in a bullish context.

**Key Levels:** Support/Shakeout Low: 259.48, Resistance: 291.09

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 287.27 (01/19 high)
- **Invalidation:** Below 259.48
---
### AEVA (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (following Buying Climax)

**Smart Money Logic:**
A massive parabolic move (01/05) culminated in a clear Buying Climax/Effort No Result on the monthly chart. This was immediately followed by a high-volume down bar (01/12) confirming aggressive institutional selling. The recent weekly down bar (01/19) confirms the momentum of the markdown phase.

**Key Levels:** Distribution High: 26.66, Immediate Support: 16.64

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 16.64
- **Invalidation:** Above 22.62
---
### AGIO (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply / Accumulation (Phase D)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The market established a major low via Stopping Volume in November (monthly context). The choppy consolidation since then suggests accumulation. The latest weekly bar (01/19) is a low volume up bar (No Supply) following a weak down bar, indicating supply has been cleared for a mark-up attempt.

**Key Levels:** Accumulation Support: 26.25, Resistance: 30.04

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 29.44
- **Invalidation:** Below 26.25
---
### AIG (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Liquidation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly chart is dominated by massive downside volume (01/05, 01/12), confirming institutional liquidation. The monthly bar closed almost at the absolute low (CLV -0.98). The last weekly bar (01/19) shows an inability to rally on low volume (No Demand), ensuring continuation of the downtrend.

**Key Levels:** Recent Low: 71.72, Resistance: 76.04

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 71.72
- **Invalidation:** Above 76.04
---
### AIQ (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Test/No Supply (in accumulation structure)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The high volume down bar on 01/12 acted as a shakeout, clearing weak hands. The subsequent rally attempt (01/19) occurred on drastically lower volume (RelVol 0.51) and achieved a decent close, confirming institutional absorption and subsequent supply depletion.

**Key Levels:** Accumulation Support: 50.87, Resistance: 53.25

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 53.25
- **Invalidation:** Below 50.87
---
### ALC (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply/Strength (following shakeout)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The high volume downside move on 01/12 acted as a shakeout, immediately followed by a powerful, low-volume rally on 01/19 (CLV 0.81). This sequence confirms that institutional demand absorbed the temporary selling and supply has dried up.

**Key Levels:** Accumulation Low: 76.74, Resistance: 82.50

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 82.50
- **Invalidation:** Below 77.88
---
### ALL (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
A massive institutional liquidation event occurred on 01/12 (Extreme Volume, CLV -0.95), confirming Supply Dominance. The subsequent narrow, low-volume up bar (01/19, RelVol 0.44) is a weak bounce (No Demand), suggesting zero interest from buyers and high probability of markdown continuation.

**Key Levels:** Distribution High: 215.00, Immediate Support: 191.50

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 191.50
- **Invalidation:** Above 201.31
---
### AMH (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Test/No Supply (following Stopping Volume/Shakeout)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The 01/05 weekly bar was a high-volume shakeout (Stopping Volume) confirmed by a recovery close off the low. This was followed by a strong up bar (01/12) and a low-volume, narrow pullback (01/19). This is a textbook successful test structure in a bullish context, signaling readiness for mark-up.

**Key Levels:** Support/Shakeout Low: 28.85, Immediate Resistance: 32.45

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 32.41
- **Invalidation:** Below 28.85
---
### AMZU (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result / Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The strong rally attempt on 01/05 was immediately rejected by the 01/12 down bar (Effort No Result confirmed). Supply is confirmed near 40.00. The 01/19 low volume down bar confirms lack of demand, suggesting continuation of the markdown in line with the bearish quarterly trend.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 40.05, Immediate Support: 33.43

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 33.43
- **Invalidation:** Above 35.93
---
### ARE (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Strength Confirmed / Continuation Pattern

**Smart Money Logic:**
Massive Stopping Volume in December initiated a major bullish reversal. Weekly action confirmed strong demand (01/05, 01/12). The latest bar (01/19) is a low volume consolidation, confirming no supply is challenging the price advance. Continuation of mark-up is highly probable.

**Key Levels:** Continuation Support: 56.01, Resistance: 58.73

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 58.73
- **Invalidation:** Below 56.01
---
### ARES (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Weakness / No Demand (following Distribution)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The asset signaled a monthly Buying Climax (distribution) in December. The 01/12 weekly bar confirmed supply entering (Effort No Result Down). The subsequent low-volume down bar (01/19, CLV -0.98) confirmed demand has vanished, leading to a break of key support levels.

**Key Levels:** Distribution Resistance: 177.72, Immediate Support: 161.22

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 162.25
- **Invalidation:** Above 170.22
---
### AS (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Weakness (No Demand)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Rally attempt (01/05) was rejected near 40.00 (Effort No Result). The reversal (01/12) confirmed supply dominance. The low volume down bar (01/19) indicates no institutional demand is supporting the price, reinforcing the bearish outlook in a bearish quarterly trend.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 40.00, Immediate Support: 35.54

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 35.54
- **Invalidation:** Above 37.21
---
### AVAV (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Effort No Result Down

**Smart Money Logic:**
The massive spike to 408.25 (01/12) showed heavy supply entering, resulting in a middling close despite huge spread. The 01/19 bar confirmed distribution with an aggressive reversal down on high volume (Effort No Result Down). A major top has likely formed, leading to markdown.

**Key Levels:** Distribution Top: 408.25, Immediate Support: 302.01

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 302.01
- **Invalidation:** Above 390.04
---
### AXTI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Following Buying Climax)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The parabolic spike (01/05, 01/12) marked a clear Buying Climax on extreme volume. The 01/12 bar reversed aggressively, confirming massive institutional distribution. The 01/19 bar continues the decline on low volume, indicating demand has collapsed and markdown will continue.

**Key Levels:** Distribution High: 26.66, Immediate Support: 19.26

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 19.26
- **Invalidation:** Above 22.69
---
### AZN (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Test (in Accumulation)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Massive volume on 01/12 resulted in a wide spread down bar that failed to close near the low, suggesting institutional absorption (Stopping Volume). The 01/19 low volume up bar confirms supply has been cleared immediately following the shakeout. This is a powerful VSA counter-trend signal.

**Key Levels:** Accumulation Support: 89.04, Resistance: 94.65

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 91.12
- **Invalidation:** Below 89.04
---
### BAH (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply (Continuation)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Following a strong breakout (01/05), the recent weekly bar (01/19) is a low volume pullback/test (RelVol 0.32). This pullback shows a lack of supply and institutional holders retaining control, confirming readiness for the mark-up phase continuation.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Support: 93.38, Resistance: 98.19

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 98.19
- **Invalidation:** Below 93.38
---
### BANC (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Strength / No Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
The price is grinding to new highs efficiently. The narrow up bar on 01/19 closed strongly (CLV 0.72) on very low volume, indicating minimal selling pressure. Despite the monthly Buying Climax warning, the immediate short-term action suggests demand has cleared immediate resistance.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 21.26, Immediate Support: 20.08

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 21.27
- **Invalidation:** Below 20.08
---
### BBIO (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Test Successful

**Smart Money Logic:**
A classic shakeout occurred on 01/12 (Extreme Volume, closed off the low - Stopping Volume). This was immediately followed by a powerful rally (01/19) on half the volume (RelVol 0.46), confirming successful supply absorption and immediate institutional demand commitment.

**Key Levels:** Support/Shakeout Low: 70.95, Resistance: 79.88

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 79.88
- **Invalidation:** Below 70.95
---
### BBT (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply (approaching resistance)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The market successfully reversed the prior supply entrance. The 01/19 wide up bar closing strongly (CLV 0.82) on very low volume (RelVol 0.32) signals a complete absence of meaningful selling pressure as the price pushes towards resistance.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 29.02, Support: 27.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 29.02
- **Invalidation:** Below 27.00
---
### BKKT (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Supply Entry

**Smart Money Logic:**
The massive spike (01/05, 01/12) climaxed near 22.11 on extreme volume, confirming major institutional distribution. The immediate and sharp weekly reversal down on 01/19 confirms supply dominance and the start of a markdown phase.

**Key Levels:** Distribution High: 22.11, Immediate Support: 15.24

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 15.24
- **Invalidation:** Above 19.78
---
### BKSY (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Pullback/Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
Price bounced strongly off a Selling Climax (12/22) and entered a mark-up phase. The 01/19 bar is a low-volume reaction down, which is a healthy test/pullback following high demand weeks. Institutional demand is confirmed to be in control above 23.93.

**Key Levels:** Support: 23.93, Resistance: 29.79

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 27.53
- **Invalidation:** Below 23.93
---
### BP (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply (Testing Supply Zone)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The high-volume shakeout (01/05) and subsequent absorption (01/12) paved the way for strength. The 01/19 narrow up bar on very low volume (RelVol 0.39) suggests that supply has been effectively cleared, making a breakout above 36.11 highly probable.

**Key Levels:** Support: 35.03, Resistance: 36.29

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 36.10 on volume
- **Invalidation:** Below 35.03
---
### BRBR (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Demand Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
Massive Selling Climax volumes (12/29, 01/05) marked a significant low (22.71) where institutional demand stepped in (Stopping Volume). The subsequent rally (01/19) confirmed strong demand commitment with a near-perfect close, suggesting a powerful counter-trend accumulation structure.

**Key Levels:** Accumulation Low: 22.71, Resistance: 30.15

### BRKR (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Shakeout and Test Successful

**Smart Money Logic:**
The 01/12 bar was a high-volume shakeout (plunging near 47.84). The immediate and strong reversal on 01/19 (wide up bar, low volume, CLV 0.94) confirms the shakeout was successful, trapping sellers, and confirming institutional demand is in control for a mark-up phase.

**Key Levels:** Shakeout Low: 47.84, Resistance: 56.22

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry near current price (51.95)
- **Invalidation:** Below 47.84
---
### BSY (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
The failed rally attempt (01/05 Effort No Result) and subsequent high-volume reversal (01/12) confirms supply dominance. The 01/19 bar drifting lower on low volume (No Demand) confirms institutional buyers are absent, paving the way for continued markdown in this bearish quarterly context.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 40.66, Immediate Support: 37.56

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 37.56
- **Invalidation:** Above 39.03
---
### BWIN (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply / Absorption

**Smart Money Logic:**
Supply was confirmed in late December (12/29), but subsequent weeks showed demand fighting back strongly (01/05, 01/12 Effort No Result implies absorption). The 01/19 narrow down bar on low volume (RelVol 0.54) confirmed supply exhaustion. This structure suggests successful accumulation/absorption is setting up a bullish breakout.

**Key Levels:** Support: 24.89, Resistance: 27.01

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 27.01
- **Invalidation:** Below 24.89
---
### BXSL (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply / Absorption

**Smart Money Logic:**
Despite monthly supply warnings, the price has consolidated tightly near highs. The 01/05 Effort No Result was followed by two narrow up bars closing strong on low volume (No Supply). This points to quiet institutional absorption and subsequent supply depletion, favoring a push to new highs.

**Key Levels:** Support: 25.90, Resistance: 27.07

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 27.07
- **Invalidation:** Below 25.90
---
### CADE (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / No Supply Confirmed

**Smart Money Logic:**
The high volume down bar on 01/12 (Stopping Volume) was an institutional shakeout. This was immediately followed by a strong rally (01/19) on low volume (RelVol 0.37), confirming that supply was successfully absorbed and the price is ready to break previous resistance in line with the bullish quarterly trend.

**Key Levels:** Support: 43.79, Resistance: 46.74

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 46.74
- **Invalidation:** Below 43.79
---
### CAI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Failed Test / Weakness

**Smart Money Logic:**
While 01/12 showed massive Stopping Volume, the market failed the subsequent test, drifting lower and closing poorly on 01/19 (CLV -0.60, low volume). This failure to show demand follow-through confirms lingering supply and weakness, favoring continuation of the bearish trend.

**Key Levels:** Support: 24.69, Resistance: 26.78

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 25.15
- **Invalidation:** Above 26.78
---
### CALM (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / No Supply Confirmed

**Smart Money Logic:**
Massive Selling Climax (01/05) followed by powerful Stopping Volume on 01/12. The 01/19 bar achieved a near-perfect close (CLV 0.95) on low volume (RelVol 0.58). This is textbook institutional accumulation, confirming supply exhaustion and setting up a strong mark-up.

**Key Levels:** Accumulation Support: 71.92, Immediate Resistance: 79.59

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry near current price (79.50)
- **Invalidation:** Below 75.72
---
### CBRL (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result Up / Weakness

**Smart Money Logic:**
The wide up bar on 01/12 was a Buying Climax/Effort No Result, showing supply entering aggressively near 36.64. The 01/19 immediate reversal down on low volume confirms a lack of demand stepping up to defend the price, indicating distribution is active.

**Key Levels:** Distribution High: 36.64, Immediate Support: 31.28

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 31.28
- **Invalidation:** Above 34.31
---
### CBSH (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply / Absorption

**Smart Money Logic:**
The initial supply shock on 01/05 (Effort No Result) was overcome by demand absorption (01/12). The latest narrow up bar (01/19) closed strongly on very low volume, indicating immediate supply is depleted and Smart Money is consolidating for a push through the resistance zone (55.66).

**Key Levels:** Support: 53.42, Resistance: 55.66

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 55.66
- **Invalidation:** Below 53.42
---
### CCOI (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply / Accumulation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The market is in a recovery phase following a major Selling Climax (Nov). The current action shows demand absorbing resistance, and the 01/19 bar grinding higher on extremely low volume (RelVol 0.23) confirms supply exhaustion and effortless movement up toward the 24.23 resistance level.

**Key Levels:** Support: 22.79, Resistance: 24.23

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 24.23
- **Invalidation:** Below 22.79
---
### CELC (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Test/No Supply (following Shakeout)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Despite monthly supply warnings, the price action on 01/12 acted as a high-volume shakeout (Stopping Volume) near 100.38. The subsequent rally (01/19) closed strongly on low volume, confirming supply clearance and paving the way for a challenge of the 116.44 resistance.

**Key Levels:** Support/Shakeout Low: 100.38, Resistance: 116.44

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry near current price (107.16)
- **Invalidation:** Below 103.00
---
### CNQ (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / No Supply Confirmed

**Smart Money Logic:**
The massive selling volume on 01/05 was successfully absorbed (Stopping Volume), followed by strong demand on 01/12. The 01/19 narrow up bar closed high on low volume (No Supply), completing a textbook bullish shakeout pattern and signaling imminent mark-up continuation.

**Key Levels:** Shakeout Low: 30.13, Resistance: 36.11

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 36.11
- **Invalidation:** Below 34.09
---
### DUOL (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly trend shows SUPPLY_DOMINANCE, and the weekly action confirms deep weakness. The week of 2026-01-12 saw high volume (RelVol 1.60) on a wide spread down, closing near the low (CLV -0.78), indicating strong selling pressure. The latest bar (2026-01-19) is low volume (RelVol 0.53) following the decline, confirming No Demand. The close remains weak, suggesting the downtrend is likely to continue in line with the Quarterly BEARISH_TREND.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Resistance: 153.28, Recent Low/Target: 142.10

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 142.10 on increased volume.
- **Invalidation:** 153.30
---
### FIBK (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Pressure

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Trend is BULLISH. While the Monthly shows a BUYING_CLIMAX (Watch for Test), recent weekly action is highly constructive. The last two weeks have shown strong upward momentum, culminating in the 2026-01-19 bar with moderate volume (RelVol 0.45) but a very strong close (CLV 0.88) near the high of the entire observed range (38.18). This suggests aggressive demand is overcoming any prior supply issues, perhaps negating the initial Monthly Climax signal.

**Key Levels:** All-Time High/Resistance: 38.18, Support: 35.97

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 38.20 on high volume to confirm new uptrend.
- **Invalidation:** 36.80
---
### FRPT (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Bullish Strength

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly context shows confirmed STOPPING_VOLUME. The weekly chart confirms strong continuation buying. The last bar (2026-01-19) shows a wide spread up, closing near the high (CLV 0.74) on moderate volume (RelVol 0.62). This bar successfully breaks out past previous resistance near 65.40 and indicates strong demand absorbing all available supply, signaling a potential markup phase continuation consistent with the Quarterly BULLISH_TREND.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Support: 65.40 (Breakout point), Resistance: 70.79 (New High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry on a low volume pullback to 68.00-69.00 range, or continuation above 70.80.
- **Invalidation:** 63.45
---
### GBCI (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Bullish Strength

**Smart Money Logic:**
Despite the Monthly SUPPLY_DOMINANCE context, the weekly action shows persistent demand. The last two bars (2026-01-12 and 2026-01-19) show sustained strength. The latest bar is low volume (RelVol 0.40) but has a very strong close (CLV 0.82) and made a new high, suggesting demand is aggressive and supply is drying up at current levels. This signals a continuation of the Quarterly BULLISH_TREND.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 49.97 (New High), Support: 47.86

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Continuation move above 50.00.
- **Invalidation:** 47.00
---
### GWRE (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Aligned with the Quarterly BEARISH_TREND and Weekly SUPPLY_DOMINANCE signal. The week of 2026-01-12 was extremely weak: high volume (RelVol 1.94) on a very wide spread down, closing near the absolute low (CLV -0.98), confirming persistent and aggressive distribution/supply. The final bar (2026-01-19) attempts a bounce, closing mid-range (CLV 0.44) but on moderate volume (RelVol 1.01), suggesting initial demand, but the prior supply shock is still dominant.

**Key Levels:** Supply Zone: 185.00, Immediate Support: 154.50

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 154.50 on increased volume.
- **Invalidation:** 161.00
---
### HDB (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
Aligned with the Quarterly BEARISH_TREND and Weekly SUPPLY_DOMINANCE signal (Watch for Test). The week of 2026-01-05 saw extremely high volume (RelVol 2.88) on a wide spread down, closing near the low (CLV -0.90), confirming powerful distribution. The subsequent weeks (2026-01-12 and 2026-01-19) show a weak recovery attempt on decreasing volume (RelVol 1.28 and 0.66, respectively), with the last bar closing poorly (CLV -0.19). This confirms No Demand following the massive supply injection.

**Key Levels:** Supply Zone: 35.75 - 36.70, Recent Low/Target: 31.77

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 31.77 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** 33.60
---
### HPE (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Successful)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart shows confirmed STOPPING_VOLUME, contradicting the BEARISH Quarterly trend, suggesting a potential trend shift. The weekly bar 2026-01-12 was high volume (RelVol 0.51) on a wide spread down, closing near the low (CLV -0.96). This could be climatic selling, marking the bottom of the recent range. The latest bar (2026-01-19) is crucial: very low volume (RelVol 0.35) but a strong close (CLV 0.82) on a narrow spread. This is a classic low-volume 'Test' of the demand, showing supply withdrawal after professional buying occurred earlier in the decline.

**Key Levels:** Climactic Low/Support: 20.07, Immediate Resistance: 21.44

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 21.50 on increased volume, confirming markup.
- **Invalidation:** 20.00
---
### INVH (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Absorption/Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly bar 2026-01-05 saw huge volume (RelVol 2.56) on a wide spread down, closing poorly (CLV -0.20), suggesting climatic selling. The following week (2026-01-12) saw high volume (RelVol 1.26) on a wide spread UP, closing near the high (CLV 0.98), confirming demand absorption and strong bullish momentum. The final bar (2026-01-19) is a low volume pullback (RelVol 0.41), representing a successful low-volume Test. This confirms the Stopping Volume/Accumulation phase is likely complete, despite the Quarterly BEARISH_TREND.

**Key Levels:** Support/Accumulation Base: 25.29, Immediate Resistance: 28.02

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 27.77 on increased volume.
- **Invalidation:** 27.16
---
### IONQ (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Distribution

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH, and the Monthly shows a confirmed BUYING_CLIMAX. The weekly chart shows strong distribution. The week of 2026-01-19 had moderate volume (RelVol 0.45) on a wide spread down, closing poorly (CLV -0.38). Although the volume is not extreme, the poor close following a strong rally attempt (2026-01-12, CLV 0.51) suggests supply is entering the market aggressively at the highs (54.24), aligning with the overall bearish outlook.

**Key Levels:** Distribution High: 54.24, Support: 45.69

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 48.00 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** 54.25
---
### IOT (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Distribution

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH, and the Monthly shows a BUYING_CLIMAX (Watch for Test). The week of 2026-01-12 saw high volume (RelVol 1.46) but closed moderately positive (CLV 0.37), indicating supply entered at the high (35.87). The latest bar (2026-01-19) confirms supply: low volume (RelVol 0.64) on a wide spread down, closing near the low (CLV -0.57). This combination confirms a failed reaction and resumed weakness after the prior Buying Climax.

**Key Levels:** Supply Zone: 35.87, Recent Low/Support: 31.25

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 31.25 on high volume.
- **Invalidation:** 33.82
---
### ITT (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Bullish Strength

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Trend is BULLISH. While the Monthly flags SUPPLY_DOMINANCE, the recent weekly action is positive. The week of 2026-01-05 showed strong institutional buying (wide spread up, CLV 0.70). The latest bar (2026-01-19) is extremely low volume (RelVol 0.35) but maintains a very strong close (CLV 0.68) near the recent high. This indicates a low volume reaction/Test has occurred, suggesting supply is scarce and the stock is prepared for a markup phase, potentially invalidating the monthly supply warning.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 186.93, Support: 180.48

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 187.00 on increased volume.
- **Invalidation:** 183.00
---
### JPM (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Weekly signal confirms SUPPLY_DOMINANCE, aligning with the Quarterly BEARISH_TREND. The week of 2026-01-12 saw extreme volume (RelVol 1.99) on a wide spread down, closing poorly (CLV -0.38), confirming strong distribution. The latest bar (2026-01-19) continues the downward pressure on lower volume (RelVol 0.47) but closes near the absolute low (CLV -0.82). This low volume continuation down, combined with the poor close, signals No Demand and confirms selling pressure remains dominant.

**Key Levels:** Supply Zone: 327.00 - 329.00, Recent Low/Target: 301.15

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 301.15 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** 311.15
---
### KEY (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Bullish Strength

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Trend is BULLISH, contrasting the confirmed Monthly SUPPLY_DOMINANCE signal (which may be old news). The latest weekly bar (2026-01-19) shows strong bullish momentum: high volume (RelVol 0.43, relative to recent volume drop) on a wide spread up, closing near the high (CLV 0.79). This action negates the prior indecisive bars and confirms demand is taking control, pushing the price towards the recent highs. This is a sign of renewed markup.

**Key Levels:** Resistance/Target: 21.86, Support: 21.17

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 21.86 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** 20.97
---
### KVYO (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Test Successful)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Both Weekly and Monthly charts show STOPPING_VOLUME, contradicting the BEARISH Quarterly Trend, suggesting potential reversal. The week of 2026-01-12 saw high volume (RelVol 1.02) on a wide spread down, closing near the low (CLV -0.96), likely climatic selling. The latest bar (2026-01-19) is a major confirmation: low volume (RelVol 0.51) on a narrow spread up, closing very strong (CLV 0.80). This is a successful low-volume Test of the low, indicating demand has absorbed the supply and the accumulation phase may be ending.

**Key Levels:** Accumulation Low: 23.00, Immediate Resistance: 25.50

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 25.50 on increased volume, confirming markup.
- **Invalidation:** 22.95
---
### KYMR (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Demand Absorption

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Trend is BULLISH, but the Monthly flags a BUYING_CLIMAX (Watch for Test). The weekly action (2026-01-05 and 2026-01-12) showed high volume selling/weakness. Crucially, the latest bar (2026-01-19) is low volume (RelVol 0.37) but has a very wide spread up and closes near the high (CLV 0.96). This is a strong demand signal (low supply entry on the push) following prior weakness, suggesting professional buying has absorbed the recent selling pressure and accumulation may be complete.

**Key Levels:** Support/Accumulation Base: 66.20, Immediate Resistance: 70.82

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 70.82 on increased volume.
- **Invalidation:** 68.80
---
### LHX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Distribution

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Weekly signal confirms BUYING_CLIMAX, despite the BULLISH Quarterly Trend. The week of 2026-01-12 saw extremely high volume (RelVol 2.09) on a wide spread up, yet the close was weak/mid-range (CLV -0.05). This confirms heavy distribution by Smart Money near the high of 361.58. The latest bar (2026-01-19) is low volume (RelVol 0.67) and shows a bounce, closing moderately positive (CLV 0.47). This low volume reaction is insufficient to absorb the massive supply from the prior week, confirming the distribution phase.

**Key Levels:** Distribution High: 361.58, Support: 340.28

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 345.00 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** 350.50
---
### MAN (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Test Successful)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart shows confirmed SUPPLY_DOMINANCE, contradicting the BULLISH Quarterly Trend. The weekly bar 2026-01-12 showed high volume (RelVol 0.89) on a wide spread down, closing poorly (CLV -0.39), suggesting supply absorption/shakeout. The latest bar (2026-01-19) is very low volume (RelVol 0.34) with a strong close (CLV 0.81), recovering most of the prior week's loss. This is a very strong low-volume Test signal, suggesting accumulation occurred at the lows (29.40) and supply is now absent. This favors the overall BULLISH Quarterly Trend.

**Key Levels:** Accumulation Base: 28.83, Immediate Resistance: 30.50

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 30.50 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** 29.35
---
### MOD (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Test Successful)

The week of 2026-01-05 saw massive volume (RelVol 2.84) on a huge spread down, closing poorly (CLV -0.20), marking climatic selling. The following week saw high volume (RelVol 0.97) with a strong close (CLV 0.70). The final bar (2026-01-19) is very low volume (RelVol 0.30) with a wide spread up, closing near the high (CLV 0.94). This is a successful low-volume Test, confirming demand has absorbed the supply and the stock is ready for a strong markup.

**Key Levels:** Accumulation Low: 111.18, Immediate Resistance: 143.99

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 144.00 on increased volume.
- **Invalidation:** 132.80
---
### MSFU (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Trend is BEARISH, and the Monthly shows SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (Watch for Test). The week of 2026-01-12 saw high volume (RelVol 1.69) on a wide spread down, closing near the low (CLV -0.72), confirming strong distribution. The latest bar (2026-01-19) is lower volume (RelVol 1.02) but manages to close weakly (CLV -0.40). The continuation down on moderate volume (relative to the past few weeks) and failure to rally confirms No Demand and suggests the distribution phase is continuing, aligned with the bearish trend.

**Key Levels:** Supply Zone: 40.85 - 42.53, Recent Low/Target: 33.85

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 33.85 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** 36.75
---
### OC (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Test Pending)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart shows confirmed STOPPING_VOLUME. The weekly bar 2026-01-05 was a huge bar (wide spread, high volume 0.89) closing near the high (CLV 0.96), confirming strong demand/accumulation. The next week (2026-01-12) saw a strong continuation move, followed by the latest bar (2026-01-19) which is low volume (RelVol 0.38) and closes moderately positive (CLV 0.37). This low volume indicates a lack of selling pressure after the recent rally and suggests the accumulation phase is giving way to a sustained markup, consistent with the BULLISH Quarterly Trend.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Support: 124.56, Resistance: 126.84 (New High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 126.85 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** 122.00
---
### OKLO (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Distribution

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart shows confirmed BUYING_CLIMAX, aligning with the Quarterly BEARISH_TREND. The week of 2026-01-05 saw explosive volume (RelVol 1.18) and a huge spread up, but the close was mid-range (CLV 0.41), indicating initial supply. The next week (2026-01-12) confirmed distribution: high volume (RelVol 0.75) on a wide spread down, closing poorly (CLV -0.38). The final bar (2026-01-19) is lower volume (RelVol 0.45) but continues the poor close (CLV -0.32), confirming a failed reaction and resumed weakness from the climax high.

**Key Levels:** Distribution High: 115.72, Support/Target: 86.02

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 89.30 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** 100.20
---
### ONB (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Bullish Strength

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Trend is BULLISH, contrasting the confirmed Monthly SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (which may represent a shakeout prior to renewed strength). The last bar (2026-01-19) shows strong bullish momentum: low volume (RelVol 0.37) but a wide spread up and closing very near the high (CLV 0.75). This is a sign of high demand efficiency and low supply availability, suggesting a break to new highs is imminent, confirming the overall bullish context.

**Key Levels:** Resistance/Target: 24.18, Support: 23.26

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 24.18 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** 23.00
---
### PSN (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Bullish Strength

**Smart Money Logic:**
Despite the Quarterly BEARISH_TREND and Monthly SUPPLY_DOMINANCE context, the last two weekly bars show decisive bullish strength, suggesting a potential short-term reversal or major accumulation. The week of 2026-01-05 saw high volume (RelVol 1.40) and an extremely strong close (CLV 0.97), followed by 2026-01-12 (RelVol 0.74, CLV 0.82). The latest bar (2026-01-19) is low volume (RelVol 0.35) but closes moderately positive (CLV 0.36), indicating a low-volume test and a successful close above prior consolidation areas. Demand is clearly present.

**Key Levels:** Resistance/Target: 73.62, Support: 70.74

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 73.62 on increased volume.
- **Invalidation:** 70.00
---
### PTGX (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Bullish Strength (Reaction to Climax)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart flags a BUYING_CLIMAX, but the weekly structure suggests accumulation/reversal. The stock bottomed out with selling pressure (2026-01-05 CLV -0.75). The final bar (2026-01-19) shows strong demand recovery: low volume (RelVol 0.38) but a wide spread up, closing near the high (CLV 0.96). This low-volume successful push suggests supply has dried up and the market is ready to test the higher resistance, potentially negating the bearish Quarterly Trend.

**Key Levels:** Accumulation Base: 78.75, Immediate Resistance: 83.96

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 84.00 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** 81.00
---
### QTWO (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Test Successful)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Trend is BEARISH, and the Monthly is confirmed SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. However, recent weekly action suggests accumulation is underway. The week of 2026-01-12 saw high volume (RelVol 0.47) on a wide spread down, closing near the low (CLV -0.92), marking a potential shakeout/climax. The last bar (2026-01-19) is low volume (RelVol 0.31) with a strong close (CLV 0.95), suggesting a successful low-volume Test of the demand after the shakeout. This indicates demand has returned and supply is drying up, possibly initiating a new upward phase.

**Key Levels:** Accumulation Low: 63.44, Immediate Resistance: 65.59

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 65.59 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** 63.70

### RF (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Bullish Strength

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Trend is BULLISH. While the Monthly shows SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (Watch for Test), the weekly trend is positive. The week of 2026-01-05 saw high volume (RelVol 0.75) with a strong spread and close (CLV 0.16), followed by a pullback (2026-01-12, high volume, poor close). Crucially, the latest bar (2026-01-19) is low volume (RelVol 0.39) on a wide spread up, closing strong (CLV 0.66). This is a successful low-volume Test, confirming demand has absorbed the prior weakness and supply is absent, readying the stock for a push to new highs.

**Key Levels:** Resistance/Target: 28.93, Support: 27.25

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 28.93 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** 27.70

### RGLD (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Bullish Strength (Climax Potential)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Trend is BULLISH, contrasting the Monthly SUPPLY_DOMINANCE signal. The last two weekly bars show extraordinary strength. The week of 2026-01-12 saw high volume (RelVol 0.90) on a wide spread up, closing near the high (CLV 0.96). The final bar (2026-01-19) saw low volume (RelVol 0.55) but maintained a wide spread up and a strong close (CLV 0.56), making a new high. This suggests a powerful continuation of the markup phase, with supply being efficiently absorbed, overriding the monthly caution.

**Key Levels:** Resistance/Target: 283.44 (New High), Support: 274.89

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Continuation move above 283.44.
- **Invalidation:** 270.00

### RGTI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Effort No Result (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly context is a confirmed early Buying Climax (2025-11-01 and 2025-12-01). The last weekly bar (2026-01-19) shows a wide spread bar (4.09) with high relative volume (RelVol 0.29, but volume is generally high compared to previous bars in the sequence) closing negatively in the bottom 38% (CLV -0.38). This indicates significant effort (volume) but minimal result (negative close), suggesting Smart Money Distribution or heavy selling absorption. This is happening within a Quarterly BEARISH_TREND.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 27.67 (2025-12-22 high), Support: 22.33 (Recent low), Monthly BC High: 30.20 (2025-12-01 high)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $22.33 (last week's low) on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above $26.50 (last week's high) or significant upward thrust.
---
### SARO (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Selling Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly chart shows a massive selling climax bar (2026-01-19). This bar has an exceptionally wide spread (3.26) and huge volume (RelVol 3.16), closing in the bottom 43% (CLV -0.56). This extreme volume indicates a major transfer of ownership, likely Smart Money initiating distribution or strong profit-taking after the initial run-up to $32.97 (2026-01-12). The immediate rejection from the high ($34.48) is highly concerning despite the Quarterly BULLISH_TREND.

**Key Levels:** Major Resistance: 34.48 (Climax high), Support: 31.22 (Climax low), Entry Trigger Short: Below 31.22

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and sustained close below $31.22, confirming follow-through selling.
- **Invalidation:** Close above $34.48.
---
### SPOT (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Confirmed Markdown

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH. The weekly chart shows a series of powerful down bars (2026-01-05 and 2026-01-12), both with very high volume and wide spreads closing near the lows (CLVs -0.91 and -0.84, respectively). This is clear Supply Dominance/Markdown. The last bar (2026-01-19) is a narrower spread down on moderate volume (RelVol 0.72) but still closing poorly (CLV -0.33). While the volume is declining, the failure to rally suggests strong underlying weakness and a lack of demand, confirming the distribution.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Resistance: 514.98, Key Resistance: 539.46 (Prior open), Support: 495.82 (Recent low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and sustained close below $495.82.
- **Invalidation:** Close above $548.55.
---
### STAA (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Confirmed)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence flagged a strong STOPPING_VOLUME on 2026-01-05 (huge volume RelVol 2.72, wide spread, closing mid-range CLV 0.03). This was confirmed by the next week (2026-01-12) with high volume and a failed low CLV -0.04. The last bar (2026-01-19) is low volume (RelVol 0.51) and narrow spread, testing the lows ($20.12) and closing near the middle, showing a lack of selling pressure after the massive absorption. This low-volume test confirms the accumulation phase, despite the Quarterly BEARISH_TREND.

**Key Levels:** Accumulation Low: 19.40, Immediate Resistance: 21.27, Target Zone: 23.00 - 23.45

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and sustained close above $21.27 on strong volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close below $19.40 (Stopping Volume low).
---
### SYF (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Confirmed)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH. The weekly sequence flagged strong STOPPING_VOLUME on 2026-01-12 (huge volume RelVol 1.85, wide spread, strong close CLV 0.52). This indicates major Smart Money absorption of supply/shakeout. The subsequent bar (2026-01-19) is a low volume (RelVol 0.54), narrow spread bar that tests the region ($75.37 low) and closes positively (CLV 0.03). This low-volume 'Test in a Bearish Trend' (TIBT) confirms the absorption and clears the path for a potential rebound.

**Key Levels:** Accumulation Low: 74.95, Immediate Resistance: 81.84, Target Zone: 84.65

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and sustained close above $78.78 (last week's high) on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close below $74.95 (Stopping Volume low).
---
### TRU (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Test of Accumulation Zone

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly context is a strong STOPPING_VOLUME (CONFIRMED_STRONG). The major shakeout occurred in January, dropping to $81.08. Following the accumulation signs (2026-01-05 and 2026-01-12, both closing strong), the last weekly bar (2026-01-19) shows a narrow spread, low volume (RelVol 0.37) testing the support area, closing in the middle (CLV -0.006). This low volume activity confirming the lack of supply is a classic Wyckoff 'Test' after accumulation, signaling an impending markup.

**Key Levels:** Accumulation Low: 81.08, Immediate Support: 81.71 (Last week's low), Immediate Resistance: 85.01

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and sustained close above $85.01 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close below $81.71.

## 👀 Watch/Monitoring
### ABVX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The rally peaked with massive volume in December (Buying Climax, 148.83). Subsequent weeks saw aggressive liquidation on high volume (Supply Dominance). The most recent weekly up move (01/19) was on very low volume (RelVol 0.41), confirming demand absence and signaling vulnerability to further markdown.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 148.83, Immediate Support: 113.64

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 113.64
- **Invalidation:** Above 122.50
---
### ACLX (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result (Weekly 01/19)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Price experienced a wide spread up on 01/19, suggesting significant buying effort, but the bar closed poorly (CLV -0.53), far off the high (76.50). This indicates aggressive supply met the rally. Given the prior monthly supply dominance, this signals strong resistance.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 76.50, Support: 66.50

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 76.50 on high volume (Bullish) or below 66.50 (Bearish)
- **Invalidation:** N/A (Monitoring stage)
---
### AL (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Extremely Tight Consolidation / Absorption

**Smart Money Logic:**
Price is locked in an extremely tight range (64.10-64.40) on subdued volume. This compression indicates low volatility and low participation, often preceding a strong expansion move. Given the bullish quarterly trend, this is likely accumulation/absorption, but confirmation is needed.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 64.40, Support: 64.07

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 64.40 on high volume
- **Invalidation:** Below 64.00
---
### AMBA (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Potential Accumulation/Stopping Volume Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
A clear waterfall decline hit a low (64.00) on 01/12 with high volume but failed to close at the low, suggesting Stopping Volume. The 01/19 bar shows a wide spread up on low volume (RelVol 0.43). This is a potential No Supply test, but the overall bearish context warrants caution until institutional commitment is confirmed.

**Key Levels:** Support: 64.00, Resistance: 70.77

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 70.77 on strong volume
- **Invalidation:** Below 64.00
---
### ARWR (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Ambiguous (Low volume strength after significant supply)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The 01/05 week showed massive selling (potential Selling Climax), but 01/12 confirmed continued weakness. The latest bar (01/19) is a wide up bar closing strong on very low volume (RelVol 0.25). This suggests supply is temporarily exhausted, but the market structure is shaky, requiring a clear demand follow-through.

**Key Levels:** Support: 60.62, Resistance: 69.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 69.00 on strong volume
- **Invalidation:** Below 60.62
---
### AXTA (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Absorption/Consolidation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The high volume up bar on 01/12 suggests supply was absorbed efficiently near resistance (33.61). The subsequent bar (01/19) is a low volume rest day (RelVol 0.39). This consolidation is occurring beneath a recent high, signaling preparation for a bullish continuation, supported by the bullish quarterly trend.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Support: 32.80, Resistance: 34.05

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 34.05 on increased volume
- **Invalidation:** Below 32.80
---
### BABX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result Up (confirmed Distribution)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The 01/12 bar was a major Effort No Result (high volume, wide spread up, closing near the low/open). This confirms aggressive distribution near 49.31. The 01/19 low volume rally is likely weak demand trying to move into strong overhead supply, setting up a short opportunity.

**Key Levels:** Distribution Resistance: 49.31, Immediate Support: 42.82

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 42.82
- **Invalidation:** Above 47.13
---
### BBWI (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply / Consolidation

**Smart Money Logic:**
Following strong demand bars, the price consolidated on 01/19 with a narrow down bar on extremely low volume (RelVol 0.24). This signifies a successful test for supply after the rally, suggesting supply exhaustion and readiness for the next leg of the mark-up.

**Key Levels:** Consolidation Support: 21.58, Resistance: 23.73

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 23.73 on strong volume
- **Invalidation:** Below 21.58
---
### BE (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Pullback/Test (Continuation Pattern)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The price is in a strong mark-up phase following a key accumulation event (Stopping Volume). The 01/19 wide down bar on low volume (RelVol 0.43) is interpreted as a healthy pullback and profit-taking activity, not institutional selling. Demand is expected to resume control shortly.

**Key Levels:** Breakout Support: 142.43, Immediate Resistance: 155.87

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 150.84 on volume
- **Invalidation:** Below 142.43
---
### BEP (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Demand (Weak Rally)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The asset is in a bearish quarterly trend with monthly Supply Dominance. Supply confirmed its presence strongly on 01/05. The current rally attempt (01/19) is occurring on extremely low volume (RelVol 0.22), indicating lack of committed demand and vulnerable structure against persistent overhead supply.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 28.76, Support: 27.48

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 27.48
- **Invalidation:** Above 28.76
---
### BFH (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Failed Test / Weakness

**Smart Money Logic:**
The 01/12 high volume down bar was a potential shakeout, but the immediate follow-up bar (01/19) failed to show bullish strength, instead closing poorly on low volume (CLV -0.61). This weak reaction following Stopping Volume suggests distribution or failed absorption, warranting caution near the low (67.78).

**Key Levels:** Shakeout Low: 67.78, Recent Support: 72.08

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 73.76 (Bullish) or below 67.78 (Bearish)
- **Invalidation:** Below 67.78
---
### BHF (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Demand / Trading Range

**Smart Money Logic:**
Price is consolidating after a rally (monthly Buying Climax). The weekly bars show persistent low volatility and volume, with a slight downside bias. The 01/19 narrow down bar on low volume (No Demand) confirms lack of demand support within the distribution range, setting up a likely break below support.

**Key Levels:** Consolidation Resistance: 65.36, Consolidation Support: 63.80

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 63.80
- **Invalidation:** Above 65.36
---
### BNS (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** No Demand (Stall at resistance)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The high volume reversal on 01/05 showed strong supply (Supply Dominance). While the 01/12 bar absorbed much of this supply, the subsequent rally attempt (01/19) stalled on very low volume, suggesting demand lacks commitment to break the resistance zone (74.97).

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 74.97, Support: 72.93

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 74.97 on heavy volume
- **Invalidation:** Below 72.93
---
### BRZE (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax / Weak Rally (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Price experienced a major Selling Climax on 01/12 (Extreme Volume, Low 22.86). The subsequent bounce (01/19) was on low volume and closed only middling (CLV 0.34). This suggests institutional absorption near the low but lacks immediate demand confirmation for a strong reversal, indicating a likely prolonged accumulation/testing phase.

**Key Levels:** Selling Climax Low: 22.66, Immediate Resistance: 24.87

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and hold above 24.87 on volume (Bullish)
- **Invalidation:** Break below 22.66
---
### CNXC (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Test Pending)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly bar (2026-01-12) showed high volume (RelVol 1.97) on a wide spread down, with the close near the high (CLV 0.76). This is classic Stopping Volume, indicating heavy professional buying into weakness. The most recent week (2026-01-19) had very low volume (RelVol 0.43) on a narrow spread, suggesting a low-volume 'Test' of the demand, but the closing is mid-range (CLV 0.40). The confirmation of demand absorption requires a stronger reaction UP on high volume, but the low volume Test is encouraging in the context of a Quarterly BULLISH_TREND.

**Key Levels:** Support: 37.85 (Stopping Volume Low), Resistance: 44.78 (Recent High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 42.50 on increased volume, confirming absorption.
- **Invalidation:** 37.80
---
### CRBG (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Neutral/Weakness after Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly context shows a strong BUYING_CLIMAX. However, the recent weekly action is indecisive. Last week's bar (2026-01-19) was low volume (RelVol 0.30) but closed strongly (CLV 0.32), representing potential minor absorption near the lows of the previous wide-spread moves (2026-01-05/12). Since the Quarterly trend is BEARISH, this minor strength is likely just a small reaction rally, and major supply remains overhead from the Monthly Buying Climax.

**Key Levels:** Monthly Climax Resistance: 31.50, Short-term Support: 29.35

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 31.11 for continuation of reaction, or below 29.35 for trend resumption.
- **Invalidation:** 31.55
---
### CSGP (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Reaction Rally)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The week of 2026-01-05 saw massive volume (RelVol 2.05) on a wide spread down, closing near the absolute low (CLV -0.98), confirming massive selling (Supply Dominance). The next week (2026-01-12) was a reaction rally on similar high volume (RelVol 2.16) and a strong close (CLV 0.86), indicating absorption of supply occurred at the lows (57.00). However, the most recent bar (2026-01-19) is low volume (RelVol 0.60) on a narrow spread, suggesting demand is fading after the initial bounce. The dominant bearish supply signal remains active.

**Key Levels:** Key Resistance/Supply: 69.00, Accumulation Area: 57.00 - 58.50

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 62.80 on high volume, confirming continued distribution.
- **Invalidation:** 68.98
---
### DOW (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Failed Reaction)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Trend is BULLISH, but the Monthly shows SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (Watch for Test). The week of 2026-01-12 had high volume (RelVol 1.02) and a wide spread up, but the close was mid-range (CLV 0.22), showing signs of supply entering the market following a strong rally period (2026-01-05). The latest bar (2026-01-19) is low volume (RelVol 0.37) but closed strong (CLV 0.87), which is a positive sign, but it has not exceeded the range high of the previous weak bar. The chart suggests indecision at higher levels following the powerful rally.

**Key Levels:** Recent High/Supply: 28.52, Support/Test Zone: 26.07

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 28.55 on significant volume for bullish continuation, or break below 27.50 for weakness confirmation.
- **Invalidation:** 26.00
---
### ENR (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Despite a BULLISH Quarterly Trend, the Monthly sequence is confirmed SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The weekly bar (2026-01-12) showed high volume (RelVol 0.88) on a wide spread down, closing near the low (CLV -0.70), indicating significant supply entering the market, neutralizing the prior week's strength (2026-01-05). The last bar (2026-01-19) is a low volume Test/Reaction which closed slightly positive but failed to meaningfully break higher, suggesting supply is still lingering above.

**Key Levels:** Supply Zone: 21.90 - 21.64, Support: 19.63

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 20.00 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** 21.95
---
### FER (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Reaction Rally)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly Trend is BULLISH, but Monthly sequence shows SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The last two weeks (2026-01-12 and 2026-01-19) have shown positive closes (CLV 0.65 and 0.39 respectively) on moderate volume, attempting to recover from the selling seen in December. The buying on 2026-01-19 was low volume (RelVol 0.35), which is typical of a slow markup or a low-conviction rally. The stock is currently consolidating near prior supply zones (68.00).

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 68.54, Support: 64.31

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 68.55 on significant volume.
- **Invalidation:** 66.60
---
### FFIV (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Test Pending)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart shows Stopping Volume (Watch for Test). The weekly action is mixed. The week of 2026-01-12 showed high volume (RelVol 1.22) on a wide spread up, but the close was negative (CLV -0.54), indicating supply entered at the high (280.75). The last week (2026-01-19) saw very low volume (RelVol 0.37) and a poor close (CLV -0.44), acting as a low volume pullback/Test of the recent high. The weakness confirms the presence of supply. Currently consolidating post-rally, waiting for clear absorption or distribution confirmation.

**Key Levels:** Supply/Resistance: 280.75, Support: 254.21

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 259.44 confirming distribution, or a high-volume reversal above 267.00.
- **Invalidation:** 280.75
---
### FISV (NEUTRAL/BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Trend is BULLISH, but the Monthly shows SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The week of 2026-01-12 was significant: extreme volume (RelVol 1.41) on a wide spread down, closing near the low (CLV -0.82). This confirms heavy distribution or strong supply overwhelming demand. The latest bar (2026-01-19) is low volume (RelVol 0.39) but manages a slightly positive close (CLV 0.56). This low-volume bounce is a weak reaction to strong supply, suggesting the supply signal from the prior week is still dominant.

**Key Levels:** Supply/Resistance: 69.53, Support: 64.18

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 64.18 on volume for confirmed distribution, or a move above 67.50 to invalidate the weakness.
- **Invalidation:** 69.53
---
### GKOS (NEUTRAL/BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Potential)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart shows a BUYING_CLIMAX (Watch for Test). The week of 2026-01-12 was climactic: extreme spread (27.67) and high volume (RelVol 1.25), but closing near the high (CLV 0.89), which sometimes precedes a minor climax/shakeout. The latest bar (2026-01-19) is low volume (RelVol 0.42) with a strong close (CLV 0.79), indicating demand absorption/follow-through. Given the overall BULLISH Quarterly Trend, this is likely accumulation/follow-through rather than a full reversal, but caution is warranted near these highs.

**Key Levels:** High Resistance: 124.83, Climactic Support: 118.25

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 124.83, or a successful low-volume pullback to 120.00.
- **Invalidation:** 118.20
---
### GNTX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Test Failed)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly context shows confirmed SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The weekly bar on 2026-01-12 had high volume (RelVol 1.21) on a wide spread, closing poorly (CLV -0.01), indicating supply overwhelmed demand at the high (24.53). The last bar (2026-01-19) is low volume (RelVol 0.43) but shows minor buying (CLV 0.24). Since this low volume failed to overcome the prior week's supply high, it is a failed Test of Supply/No Demand signal, suggesting supply remains in control, despite the BULLISH Quarterly trend.

**Key Levels:** Supply/Resistance: 24.53, Support: 23.34

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 23.34 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** 24.55
---
### HRMY (NEUTRAL/BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Test Pending)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Trend is BULLISH, but the Monthly shows SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The weekly bar 2026-01-12 showed high volume (RelVol 1.03) on a wide spread down, closing mid-range (CLV -0.34). This suggests distribution or institutional selling, reversing the prior upward momentum. The last bar (2026-01-19) is very low volume (RelVol 0.29) with a strong close (CLV 0.64). This is a low volume effort to rally, but the low volume confirms a lack of aggressive follow-through demand, aligning with the expected Supply Dominance pattern.

**Key Levels:** Supply/Resistance: 39.40, Support: 35.16

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 36.00 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** 37.50
---
### IMAX (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Reaction Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart flags Stopping Volume (Watch for Test). The week of 2026-01-05 was weak (CLV -0.45). The week of 2026-01-12 showed strong accumulation potential: high volume (RelVol 1.22) on a wide spread up, closing near the high (CLV 0.90), suggesting demand absorbed supply. The final week (2026-01-19) shows low volume (RelVol 0.37) but a negative close (CLV -0.31). This weak close on low volume indicates a poor Test of the prior strength, and supply is still present near the 37.85 resistance area.

**Key Levels:** Supply/Resistance: 37.85, Support: 33.62

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A definitive move and close above 37.85 on volume for bullish confirmation.
- **Invalidation:** 36.00
---
### IREN (NEUTRAL/BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Weakness/Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Trend is BULLISH, but the Monthly shows SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (Watch for Test). The week of 2026-01-12 was powerful (high volume, wide spread up, CLV 0.85). However, the last bar (2026-01-19) shows weakness from the top: very high volume (RelVol 0.56) on a wide spread down from the high, closing near the middle (CLV 0.05). This suggests significant supply entered the market above 57.65, potentially creating a secondary distribution top, despite the overall bullish trend. This is 'Effort No Result' on the upswing.

**Key Levels:** Supply/Resistance: 58.75, Immediate Support: 53.48

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 53.00 on high volume.
- **Invalidation:** 58.75
---
### KDP (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Potential)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the Monthly flags a BUYING_CLIMAX (Watch for Test). The weekly bars show narrow ranges and mixed closes, suggesting indecision. The week of 2026-01-12 had high volume (RelVol 0.69) with a wide spread down, closing near the low (CLV -0.82), a sign of weakness/supply. The last bar (2026-01-19) is low volume (RelVol 0.34) with a slightly positive close (CLV 0.19). This low-volume bounce suggests demand is weak, but there is no confirmed strong supply follow-through yet. Consolidation under potential supply is the key theme.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 28.36, Support: 27.08

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 28.36 or break below 27.08 on volume.

### LQDA (NEUTRAL/BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Failed Reaction)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart shows confirmed SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The week of 2026-01-12 was a rally attempt on high volume (RelVol 1.25) but closed poorly (CLV -0.01), indicating supply entered at the top (41.56). The latest bar (2026-01-19) is very low volume (RelVol 0.35) but closed positively (CLV 0.52). However, this low-volume rally cannot be trusted to overcome the strong supply previously identified. The stock is currently consolidating below the primary supply level (41.56).

**Key Levels:** Supply/Resistance: 41.56, Support: 37.67

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 37.67 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** 41.60

### NFXL (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (No Demand)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Weekly signal is STOPPING_VOLUME (Watch for Test), but the pattern suggests failure. The week of 2026-01-19 saw the highest volume (RelVol 2.40) in the sequence on a very wide spread down, closing poorly (CLV -0.15). While this wide spread/high volume could be climatic, the poor close confirms heavy supply. Subsequent weeks failed to show demand. The overall BEARISH Quarterly Trend suggests this latest move is likely continued distribution rather than accumulation.

**Key Levels:** Supply/Resistance: 27.96, Recent Low/Target: 23.15

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 23.15 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** 28.00
---
### NICE (NEUTRAL/BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Test Pending)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Trend is BULLISH, but the Monthly shows SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The weekly bar 2026-01-12 saw high volume (RelVol 1.46) on a wide spread down, closing near the low (CLV -0.36), indicating selling pressure entering the market near prior highs (118.37). The latest bar (2026-01-19) is low volume (RelVol 0.49) with a slightly positive close (CLV 0.24). This is a low volume 'Test' following supply, and the price failed to recover meaningfully, confirming demand is weak and supply is likely dominant at current levels.

**Key Levels:** Supply/Resistance: 118.37, Support: 109.30

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 111.00 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** 115.21

### PGY (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Trend is BEARISH, and the Monthly shows confirmed SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The weekly bar 2026-01-12 confirms this: high volume (RelVol 0.91) on a wide spread down, closing near the low (CLV -0.93), showing persistent selling. The final bar (2026-01-19) is low volume (RelVol 0.37) but attempts a weak rally (CLV 0.40). This low volume reaction following strong supply is a 'No Demand' signal, reinforcing the bearish outlook.

**Key Levels:** Supply/Resistance: 22.62, Recent Low/Target: 20.62

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 20.62 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** 22.00
---
### QQQI (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Potential)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly Trend is BULLISH, but the Monthly flags a BUYING_CLIMAX (Watch for Test). The weekly bars are tight, indicating indecision/consolidation at highs. The last two bars (2026-01-12 and 2026-01-19) show low volume (RelVol 1.22 and 0.81, relative to prior extremes) and mixed closes (CLV -0.02 and 0.03). This suggests demand is unable to push the price decisively higher, possibly indicating supply is capping the move, aligned with the monthly climax warning.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 54.85, Support: 53.90

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 54.85 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** 53.90
---
### RARE (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Weekly signal confirms SUPPLY_DOMINANCE, aligning with the Quarterly BEARISH_TREND. The week of 2025-12-29 saw huge volume (RelVol 4.56) on a wide spread up, closing strong (CLV 0.85). However, this high volume move failed immediately, followed by two weeks of confirmed weakness (2026-01-05 and 2026-01-12), closing poorly on volume (CLV -0.70 and -0.91 respectively). The last bar (2026-01-19) is low volume (RelVol 0.54) with a slightly positive close (CLV 0.54). This weak reaction confirms No Demand and the prior high volume move was likely a failed institutional attempt to absorb supply.

**Key Levels:** Supply/Resistance: 24.65, Recent Low/Target: 22.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 22.00 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** 23.60
---
### RKT (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Distribution Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence shows a climax high (2026-01-05, huge spread/volume/CLV 0.92) followed by a strong down bar (2026-01-12, high volume, CLV -0.15) and confirmed by the last bar (2026-01-19, wide spread, moderate volume, negative close CLV -0.64). The Monthly context is SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The aggressive reversal from the $24.36 high indicates significant selling pressure overwhelming previous bullish efforts, despite the Quarterly BULLISH_TREND.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 23.41 (Climax high), Immediate Support: 20.91 (Last week's low), Key Support: 19.89 (Start of climax bar)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and sustained close below $20.91.
- **Invalidation:** Close above $23.41.
---
### RLI (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax / Persistent Weakness

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly context is BUYING_CLIMAX, but the price has been moving down consistently in a Quarterly BEARISH_TREND. The last few weekly bars (2025-12-29, 2026-01-05, 2026-01-12) show wide spreads down on varying volume, indicating persistent supply. The last bar (2026-01-19) is a narrower spread, lower volume, closing negatively (CLV -0.27). This suggests the selling momentum is tiring, but there is no immediate Stopping Volume or demand entry yet. The price is hovering near recent lows ($58.33).

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 60.52 (2026-01-12 high), Support: 58.20 (Recent low), Major Resistance: 67.12 (Monthly BC high)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A definitive Test (low volume wide spread up close) near $58.20.
- **Invalidation:** Sustained break below $58.00.
---
### RTO (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Up-thrust

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence flagged STOPPING_VOLUME on 2026-01-12 (high volume, wide spread, positive CLV 0.16), suggesting Smart Money absorbed supply. However, the subsequent bar (2026-01-19) is also high volume (RelVol 1.46) with a wide spread UP, closing high (CLV 0.71). This is a strong bullish move, confirming demand is present. The prior detection was premature, as the accumulation continued. Given the Quarterly BULLISH_TREND, this suggests strength, but we need to see how it handles the prior high ($32.20).

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 32.50 (New high), Support: 30.62 (Low before volume surge), Recent Accumulation Low: 30.76

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and hold above $32.50 on confirmation volume, or a successful low volume shakeout/test back to $31.50.
- **Invalidation:** Close below $30.76.
---
### SA (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result Up

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the Monthly is SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The last weekly bar (2026-01-19) shows high volume (though lower RelVol at 0.48) and a wide spread up, hitting a new high ($34.63), but closing negatively (CLV -0.31). This is a classic Effort No Result Up signal. Smart Money likely used the strong upward move to distribute into the rally, failing to hold the gains. This suggests a potential reversal or significant supply looming.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 34.64 (High of distribution bar), Support: 31.75 (Low of distribution bar), Key Support: 30.04

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close below $31.75 on increased volume, confirming weakness.
- **Invalidation:** Sustained close above $34.64.
---
### TFX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax / Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH. The last two weekly bars show intense selling pressure: 2026-01-12 has high volume and an extremely weak close (CLV -0.93), followed by a narrow spread up bar (2026-01-19) on low volume (RelVol 0.56) that closes high (CLV 0.67). While the last bar appears bullish, it is likely a minor automatic rally (AR) following the Selling Climax (SC) week prior. Given the bearish context and the strong SC, the market is currently in the markdown phase, and this rally needs a strong confirmation to reverse the trend.

**Key Levels:** Climax Low/Support: 100.18, Resistance: 103.49 (Last week's high), Key Resistance: 112.90 (Prior resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A failed rally and a break below $100.18.
- **Invalidation:** Sustained close above $112.90.

### USIG (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Low Volume Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
This is a low volatility, tight-range security in a Quarterly BULLISH_TREND. The last two weeks (2026-01-12 and 2026-01-19) feature high volume followed by low volume. 2026-01-12 (RelVol 2.36) was an Up-thrust with a negative close (CLV -0.41), confirming supply dominance at the high end of the range. The last bar (2026-01-19) is low volume (RelVol 0.53) but closes high (CLV 0.72), suggesting supply is receding, allowing price to rally within the tight range. The underlying trend is bullish, but current price action suggests caution due to the prior rejection.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 52.12 (Up-thrust high), Support: 51.65 (Recent low), Accumulation Low: 51.70

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Sustained breakout above $52.12 on significant volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close below $51.61.
---
### VONG (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Shortening of the Thrust Down

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH, and the Monthly is SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The last few weeks show heavy selling (2026-01-12: high volume, CLV -0.32). However, the latest bar (2026-01-19) has moderate volume (RelVol 0.76) but a narrow spread, closing positively (CLV 0.25). The narrowing spread on the downtrend, despite the overall bearish context, suggests selling pressure is momentarily exhausting (Shortening of the Thrust Down, or SOTD). This is an early sign of potential accumulation or consolidation, but confirmation (like a spring or strong test) is needed.

**Key Levels:** Support: 117.64 (SOTD low), Immediate Resistance: 119.86, Key Resistance: 121.73 (Prior week open)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $119.86 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** Break below $117.64.

### WGMI (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Effort No Result Down

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly context is a confirmed early Buying Climax. The recent action saw an intense up bar (2026-01-12) followed by a sharp reversal bar (2026-01-19). This bar is wide spread down (5.85), high volume (RelVol 0.53, but high absolute volume compared to recent average) but closes negatively in the middle-low range (CLV -0.04). The inability to close lower despite the wide spread and high volume suggests some absorption/demand coming in at the lows ($45.11), which could halt the immediate decline. This is 'Effort No Result Down' following a Buying Climax, making the picture mixed: distribution is likely, but demand is stabilizing price.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 51.78 (Climax high), Support: 45.11 (Last week's low), Key Support: 44.34

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a low-volume test or clear break of $45.11.
- **Invalidation:** Close above $51.78.
---
### WRB (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Low Volume Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH, and the Monthly is SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. Price has been consistently driven lower, confirmed by the prior weeks (2026-01-05 and 2026-01-12) showing wide spreads down and negative closes. The last bar (2026-01-19) is low volume (RelVol 0.32) and narrow spread, closing slightly positive (CLV 0.14). This low volume test indicates that sellers are resting, but there is no strong demand yet. Given the macro weakness, this low volume rally is likely temporary before the markdown resumes.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Resistance: 68.32 (Last week's high), Support: 66.50 (Recent low), Breakdown Point: 67.57

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Failure to break above $68.32, followed by a break below $66.50 on rising volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above $69.78.

## Other
### AEO (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Demand (following Buying Climax)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The market registered a Buying Climax in December (High 28.46) on high volume. The subsequent weekly price action confirms supply entering. The latest weekly bar (01/19) is a weak, low-volume attempt to rally (No Demand, RelVol 0.30), suggesting the distribution phase is likely complete and markdown is imminent.

**Key Levels:** Climax High: 28.46, Immediate Support: 23.88

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 23.88
- **Invalidation:** Above 28.33

### CORT (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
The initial high volume spike (2025-12-29) on a massive spread down (Spread 49.99) with an extremely low CLV (-0.79) was climactic selling. However, the subsequent weeks, especially 2026-01-19, show a substantial decrease in volume (RelVol 0.48) with a strong close (CLV 0.35), hinting at accumulation after the climatic event. The massive volume on 2025-12-29 is classified as Stopping Volume, potentially marking the low, despite the overall BEARISH_TREND quarterly context. The monthly sequence shows SUPPLY_DOMINANCE, suggesting this initial bounce is likely a reaction to the Selling Climax and needs confirmation.

**Key Levels:** Climactic Low: 32.99, Immediate Resistance: 38.20

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A definitive break and hold above 38.50 on high volume.
- **Invalidation:** 32.90

### CPNG (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly chart shows consistent weakness, culminating in high volume (RelVol 2.07) on 2026-01-12 with a wide spread down and a close near the low (CLV -0.61). This signifies strong selling pressure (Supply Dominance). The most recent low volume bar (RelVol 0.52) also closed near the low (CLV -0.92), confirming that supply is still in control and demand is weak. This aligns with the Quarterly BEARISH_TREND.

**Key Levels:** Supply Zone: 22.87 - 23.65, Recent Low: 20.20

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 20.20 on high volume.
- **Invalidation:** 21.20 (Failure to make a new low)
---
### CTRA (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly bar (2026-01-12) exhibited extremely high volume (RelVol 2.07) on a wide spread up, yet the close was near the low (CLV -0.45). This is a textbook Buying Climax, signifying smart money distributing shares into institutional enthusiasm. The last bar (2026-01-19) is low volume (RelVol 0.45) with a positive close, but this weak follow-through suggests demand cannot sustain the move after the climax event.

**Key Levels:** Climax High: 28.48, Support: 24.68

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 26.00 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** 28.50
