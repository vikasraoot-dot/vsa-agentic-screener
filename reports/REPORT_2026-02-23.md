## 🚀 Ready for Entry
### ABVX (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Potential Absorption

**Smart Money Logic:**
Large supply entered in late January (RelVol 2.5), but smart money stepped in to support price at 107.00. The recent week shows price rising on lower volume but with a high Close-to-Low Value (CLV), suggesting supply is being absorbed.

**Key Levels:** 133.42, 110.98

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 133.50
- **Invalidation:** 123.90
---
### ACWI (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result

**Smart Money Logic:**
Price is grinding higher on high volume, but the daily spreads are relatively narrow. This suggests professional money is absorbing supply as they push higher. The high CLV on the latest week (0.97) shows buyers are firmly in control of the close.

**Key Levels:** 148.41, 144.39

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 148.50
- **Invalidation:** 145.00
---
### AEHR (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Absorption of Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
A high-volume wide-spread bar on Feb 9th initially looked like supply, but the immediate recovery and close at the high in the following week (CLV 0.98) suggests buyers have overwhelmed the sellers.

**Key Levels:** 37.49, 26.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 33.70
- **Invalidation:** 28.50
---
### AGIO (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
After supply entered in December, the price stabilized. The current monthly bar shows a high CLV (0.98) on lower volume, which is a 'Test' in VSA terms, suggesting supply has been removed.

**Key Levels:** 29.93, 26.04

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 29.30
- **Invalidation:** 27.80
---
### AHR (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
Massive demand spike on Jan 26th (RelVol 3.99). Price has held the gains and continues to push higher. The latest week shows a pause (narrow spread), which is likely a test of the climax bar.

**Key Levels:** 53.09, 51.72

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** High volume breakout above 53.10
- **Invalidation:** 51.00
---
### ALC (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
After a period of supply dominance, the latest weekly bar shows an increase in volume with a positive CLV, suggesting that professional buyers are starting to support the price near the 79 level.

**Key Levels:** 84.40, 76.95

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 83.00
- **Invalidation:** 79.30
---
### ALGM (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Absorption

**Smart Money Logic:**
High volume on the move up in late January followed by a high CLV bar on Feb 2nd. The recent pullback is on higher volume but holding above previous resistance, which looks like a shakeout before further upside.

**Key Levels:** 43.86, 36.06

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Recovery above 41.50
- **Invalidation:** 36.00
---
### AMSC (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
Price surged on high volume (Feb 9). The current week is a high-volume pullback but price is holding the mid-point of the surge, suggesting institutional accumulation on the dip.

**Key Levels:** 38.10, 27.74

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 38.10
- **Invalidation:** 32.50
---
### ARE (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
Monthly stopping volume is confirmed. The recent dip was bought aggressively. The current trend is sideways but with a bullish bias as supply is drying up.

**Key Levels:** 59.76, 50.10

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 57.50
- **Invalidation:** 52.23
---
### ARMK (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
Strong demand has pushed price into new highs. High CLV on the latest week (0.88) suggests that while it's climactic, buyers are still absorbing all available supply.

**Key Levels:** 42.94, 38.97

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 41.10
- **Invalidation:** 38.97
---
### AS (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Potential Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
Price is trending higher. The volume on the latest move up is healthy and the CLV is positive. Supply dominance was noted earlier, but price action is now negating it.

**Key Levels:** 42.76, 34.82

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 42.80
- **Invalidation:** 39.28
---
### ASML (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 1488.00
- **Invalidation:** 1380.00
---

Massive volume on Feb 2nd and Feb 9th indicates a panic sell-off. The spread narrowed significantly in the last week, suggesting the selling pressure is reaching an equilibrium (Stopping Volume), but no confirmation of demand yet.

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Spring/Reversal bar at 16.50
- **Invalidation:** 16.25

### BSX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
Huge volume spike (RelVol 3.4) on Feb 2nd marked a major change in behavior. While it looks like stopping volume, the price remains pinned to the lows with very negative CLV, indicating supply is still overwhelming the support.

**Key Levels:** 72.69, 74.58, 87.03

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Failure of 72.69 support
- **Invalidation:** 76.87
---
### BSY (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Buying climax followed by a distribution phase. High volume churn on the monthly chart with a very negative CLV (-0.79) suggests professional distribution. Weekly volume is rising on the downside.

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break of 32.84
- **Invalidation:** 35.32

### BWA (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
Extreme volume spike (RelVol 2.80) on a wide spread up-move, followed immediately by a high-volume down-move with a negative CLV (-0.71). This is a classic 'Upthrust' or climax followed by supply entering.

**Key Levels:** 52.02, 58.92, 70.08

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 58.00
- **Invalidation:** 64.28
---
### BWIN (BEARISH)

- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 16.22
- **Invalidation:** 17.71

---
### BXP (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
Volume expanded on the dip but the last week saw volume dry up significantly (RelVol 0.57 on monthly context). This suggests the initial panic has subsided, but demand is not yet present to lift the price.

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** High volume reversal off 58.00
- **Invalidation:** 57.59
---
### BXSL (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
Gradual decline into high volume support. While the spread is narrowing, the CLV remains negative (-0.58), suggesting that the 'Stopping Volume' is not yet leading to a reversal bar.

**Key Levels:** 23.42, 23.71, 25.42

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 23.42
- **Invalidation:** 24.82
---
### CADE (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Massive volume (RelVol 4.79) was seen on a narrow spread, which in VSA terms is 'Effort Versus Results' (Bearish). The price is unable to move up despite massive activity, suggesting a ceiling of supply.

**Key Levels:** 41.60, 42.11, 46.74

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Breakdown below 41.60
- **Invalidation:** 43.58
---
### CAR (BEARISH)

- **Invalidation:** 114.02

- **Invalidation:** 161.39
---
### CBSH (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Absorption

- **Invalidation:** 52.76

- **Invalidation:** 23.62
---
### CDNS (BULLISH)

- **Invalidation:** 28.58

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Reversal bar above 24.00
- **Invalidation:** 21.60
---

- **Invalidation:** 38.07
---
### CRBG (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Price is falling on low volume, but the close is near the lows (-0.71 CLV). This 'Lack of Demand' indicates price will likely continue lower until volume expands to show stopping activity.

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 29.29
- **Invalidation:** 31.07
---
### CSGP (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
High volume selling (RelVol 1.90 and 1.51) pushed price significantly lower. The recent bounce (RelVol 1.48) has moderate CLV, suggesting it's likely a short-covering rally rather than new demand.

- **Invalidation:** 52.35

### CUZ (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Failure at 24.00
- **Invalidation:** 25.20
---
### CVS (BEARISH)

- **Entry Trigger:** Break of 42.42
- **Invalidation:** 48.20
---
### ENR (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Price is stalling on decreasing volume. The negative CLV in the last week suggests that demand is absent and the market is vulnerable to a new leg down.

**Key Levels:** 21.28, 22.43, 23.18

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 21.56
- **Invalidation:** 23.09
---

- **Invalidation:** 212.67
---
### OMF (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Consistent high volume on wide-spread down bars, particularly in early February, indicates professional selling. Last week's narrow spread on lower volume suggests a lack of demand rather than supply exhaustion.

- **Invalidation:** $61.00

- **Invalidation:** $15.50

- **Invalidation:** $106.50
---
### PSN (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**

---
### PYPL (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Shakeout

**Smart Money Logic:**
Massive 3.4x RelVol on the Feb 2 drop suggests a climactic sell-off. Last week's narrow spread suggests volume is drying up, which often precedes a bottom, but needs confirmation.

### WGMI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
After a Monthly Buying Climax, the weekly action shows a significant increase in volume on the Feb 2nd drop, suggesting supply entering. The subsequent two weeks show price failing to recover on significantly lower volume (RelVol 0.60 and 0.50), indicating a lack of professional interest in higher prices.

**Key Levels:** $34.99 (Support), $44.50 (Resistance), $49.13 (Secondary Resistance)

- **Invalidation:** $44.50

### WPC (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Up-Thrust / Supply Returning

**Smart Money Logic:**
Price moved into new highs for the month but the most recent weekly bar shows high relative volume (1.84) with a negative CLV (-0.13), closing near the low of the week. This 'Effort No Result' suggests that supply is meeting the price advance at the $74 level.

**Key Levels:** $70.60 (Support), $74.72 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Successful test of $70.60 with low volume
- **Invalidation:** $74.75
---
### WRB (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** No Professional Interest

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stock is drifting sideways on declining relative volume (0.69). While the trend remains technically bullish on the quarterly context, the lack of volume on the recent up-ticks suggests this is a retail-driven move with no 'Smart Money' commitment.

**Key Levels:** $67.25 (Support), $73.07 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A wide spread up-bar on volume > 15M
- **Invalidation:** $68.00

### XYL (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The bar on Feb 9th was a massive distribution bar (2.46x RelVol). The most recent week attempted to stabilize but closed poorly with negative CLV. High volume on small price spread (Feb 16) indicates that supply is still overwhelming the buyers.

**Key Levels:** $123.98 (Key Support), $132.36 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $127.00
- **Invalidation:** $132.40
---
### Z (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Panic Selling / Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
Extreme supply dominance. RelVol reached nearly 3.0x on the Feb 9th drop. While the most recent week shows some volume coming in to support the price (RelVol 1.72), the CLV remains very low (0.19), suggesting the falling knife hasn't found a floor yet.

**Key Levels:** $42.50 (Critical Low), $53.61 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a successful low-volume test of $42.50
- **Invalidation:** $42.00
---
### ZM (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
After the Buying Climax on Jan 26th (RelVol 2.0), the price has stalled. The most recent week shows a narrow spread and a negative CLV on average volume. This is indicative of 'No Demand' after a peak, suggesting a corrective phase is likely.

**Key Levels:** $87.19 (Support), $97.58 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Failure to hold $88.00
- **Invalidation:** $93.21
