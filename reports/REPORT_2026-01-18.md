## 🚀 Ready for Entry
### ACAD (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply / Test Observed (Weekly & Monthly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart shows a down close (-0.61 CLV) on very low relative volume (0.39), indicative of No Supply. The price action suggests selling interest is drying up after the previous month's push. The last weekly candle is a down close (-0.71 CLV) on lower volume (RelVol 0.80), but it tested the area around $25.81. This low volume selling into a support zone suggests Smart Money is not pressing the price lower and supply is limited.

**Key Levels:** Support: $25.56 (Monthly Low/Recent Weekly Low), Resistance: $27.74 (Monthly High), Intermediate Resistance: $26.78

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry on a higher open and continuation above $26.50, targeting continuation toward $27.74. Wait for a confirmed 'Upthrust/Shakeout' completion if price dips below $25.81 then immediately reverses.
- **Invalidation:** $25.50 (Break below monthly low)
---
### AEO (NEUTRAL/BULLISH Potential)
**VSA Status:** Monthly Test Observed

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly bar closed significantly off its low (CLV -0.32), indicating absorption or buying near the monthly low of $23.88, albeit on below-average volume (RelVol 0.51). The last weekly bar, with moderate volume (RelVol 0.88) and a wide spread, closed mid-range/low (-0.02 CLV), effectively testing the monthly low area and rejecting lower prices ($23.88). The long lower tail on the weekly bar, coinciding with the monthly low, suggests a successful Test of Supply.

**Key Levels:** Support: $23.88 (Monthly Low/Test Zone), Resistance: $27.08 (Recent Weekly High), High Resistance: $28.46

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry above $25.44 (the close of the test bar) on increasing volume. Target $27.08-$28.46.
- **Invalidation:** $23.80 (Violation of the Test low)
---
### AFL (BULLISH Potential)
**VSA Status:** No Supply / Test Observed (Monthly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart shows a narrow spread down close (-0.23 CLV) on low volume (RelVol 0.59), confirming selling pressure is limited (No Supply). The recent weekly bar shows wide spread down, but closes significantly off the low (CLV 0.25) on high volume (RelVol 1.45), representing a potential Stopping Volume/Test within the monthly No Supply context. The low of $107.36 held firm.

**Key Levels:** Support: $107.36 (Monthly Low/Test Zone), Resistance: $110.81 (Recent Weekly High), High Resistance: $112.93

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry above $109.51 (the close of the test bar) on positive daily volume confirmation.
- **Invalidation:** $107.00 (Violation of the Test low)
---
### ALK (BULLISH Potential)
**VSA Status:** No Supply / Test Observed (Monthly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart shows a medium spread, high CLV (0.12), on below-average volume (RelVol 0.65). This indicates sellers are not prevalent (No Supply) and buyers are starting to control the range, following two months of aggressive bullish movement. The last weekly bar is a wide spread up close (CLV 0.85) on high volume (RelVol 1.14), strongly suggesting the Test of Supply near the $46.38 low was successful and demand has returned.

**Key Levels:** Support: $46.38 (Monthly Low/Test Zone), Resistance: $50.33 (Recent Weekly High), High Resistance: $52.89

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry above $50.04 (the close of the recent strong bar) on continuation volume.
- **Invalidation:** $48.36 (Recent weekly support break)
---
### AMX (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply / Test Observed (Monthly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart shows a narrow spread down close (CLV 0.08) on below-average volume (RelVol 0.69). This is a strong indication of No Supply, as the selling effort failed to produce a low close despite low volume. The last weekly bar, with high volume (RelVol 1.73) and a narrow spread up close (CLV 0.34), bounced sharply off the low ($19.70) confirming aggressive demand entered the market. This looks like a successful shakeout/test of the low.

**Key Levels:** Support: $19.70 (Monthly Low/Shakeout Zone), Resistance: $20.82 (Recent Weekly High), High Resistance: $21.09

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry on continuation above $20.45, confirming follow-through demand.
- **Invalidation:** $19.65 (Break below the low of the shakeout bar)
---
### ANET (NEUTRAL/BULLISH Potential)
**VSA Status:** Monthly Test Observed

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly bar is a wide spread down bar (-0.08 CLV) on below-average volume (RelVol 0.51). The close is well off the low ($120.00), resulting in a long lower tail, suggesting a successful Test of Supply/Absorption by Smart Money near the key psychological level of $120. The last weekly bar closed up (CLV 0.47) on high volume (RelVol 1.13), confirming demand presence after the price tested $120.00.

**Key Levels:** Support: $120.00 (Monthly Low/Test Zone), Resistance: $133.34 (Recent Weekly High), High Resistance: $141.41

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry above $129.83 (the close of the test bar) on subsequent volume confirmation.
- **Invalidation:** $119.50 (Break below the Test low)
---
### APO (NEUTRAL/BULLISH Potential)
**VSA Status:** No Supply / Test Observed (Monthly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart shows a narrow spread down close (-0.41 CLV) on low volume (RelVol 0.43). This confirms No Supply. The price closed well off the low of $139.94, suggesting Smart Money bought into the weakness (Test Observed). The last weekly bar, with average volume (RelVol 0.92) and a narrow spread up close (CLV 0.25), confirmed a Test of the recent lows and a mild absorption effort. The setup is supportive of a bounce.

**Key Levels:** Support: $139.94 (Monthly Low/Test Zone), Resistance: $146.25 (Recent Weekly High), High Resistance: $153.29

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry above $143.88 on follow-through volume, targeting $146.25.
- **Invalidation:** $139.50 (Violation of the Test low)
---
### AS (NEUTRAL/BULLISH Potential)
**VSA Status:** No Supply / Test Observed (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is a medium spread down close (-0.49 CLV) on low volume (RelVol 0.72). The volume is low enough to suggest a No Supply condition after testing the low of $36.46. The close is near the middle of the range, which, when combined with low volume, suggests an effective Test of Supply near support. Smart Money is likely satisfied with the current lack of sellers.

**Key Levels:** Support: $36.24 (Monthly Low/Test Zone), Resistance: $38.73 (Recent Weekly High), Intermediate Resistance: $38.53

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry above $37.50 on increasing daily volume, confirming demand has resumed. Wait for a positive Test on the daily chart.
- **Invalidation:** $36.20 (Break below recent support)
---
### BAC (NEUTRAL/BULLISH Potential)
**VSA Status:** Monthly Test Observed

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart shows a medium spread down close (-0.56 CLV) on below-average volume (RelVol 0.67). The bar has a long lower tail, suggesting Smart Money tested the low of $51.66 and absorbed supply (Test Observed). The last weekly bar is a wide spread down close (-0.32 CLV) on extreme volume (RelVol 1.85). This is Selling Climax volume, confirming the absorption phase near $51.66. The close, significantly off the low, validates the presence of demand.

**Key Levels:** Support: $51.66 (Monthly Low/Absorption Zone), Resistance: $55.52 (Recent Weekly High), High Resistance: $57.55

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry above $52.97 (the close of the climax bar) on follow-through demand.
- **Invalidation:** $51.60 (Violation of the Selling Climax low)
---
### BBWI (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply / Test Observed (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart shows a strong up close (CLV 0.76) on below-average volume (RelVol 0.56), confirming demand is controlling the price (Low supply). The last weekly bar is a narrow spread down close (CLV 0.31) on low volume (RelVol 0.73). This low volume selling effort failed to significantly mark down the price and the close is positive, confirming a strong Test of Supply in the area. This is highly bullish.

**Key Levels:** Support: $22.39 (Weekly Low/Test Zone), Resistance: $23.73 (Recent Weekly High), High Resistance: $24.89 (Monthly High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry above $23.27 (the close of the test bar) on continuation volume.
- **Invalidation:** $22.30 (Violation of the Test low)

### BFH (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last Weekly bar is a wide spread up close (CLV 0.86) on ultra-high volume (RelVol 2.62). Despite the wide spread, the highly positive CLV indicates massive demand entering the market near the low of $67.78, overwhelming sellers. This is a very strong Stopping Volume signal, often marking a significant reversal point.

**Key Levels:** Support: $67.78 (Stopping Volume Low/Monthly Low), Resistance: $74.17 (Recent Weekly High), Intermediate Resistance: $76.66

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry above $73.73 (the close of the Stopping Volume bar) on any subsequent positive action.
- **Invalidation:** $67.70 (Violation of the Stopping Volume low)
---
### BHF (NEUTRAL/BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply / Test Observed (Weekly & Monthly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart shows a very narrow spread down close (-0.69 CLV) on very low volume (RelVol 0.67), confirming No Supply. The price closed off the low ($63.80), suggesting a successful Test. The last weekly bar is a narrow spread down close (-0.46 CLV) on low volume (RelVol 0.73). This low volume selling effort failed to mark down the price significantly, confirming weak supply near support. This sets up a bullish continuation.

**Key Levels:** Support: $63.80 (Monthly Low/Test Zone), Resistance: $64.69 (Recent Weekly High), High Resistance: $65.36

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry above $64.04 (the close of the test bar) on increasing volume. Target $65.36.
- **Invalidation:** $63.75 (Break below recent support/Monthly Low)

### CAR (BULLISH Potential)
**VSA Status:** No Supply / Test Observed (Monthly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly bar shows a narrow spread down close (-0.22 CLV) on very low volume (RelVol 0.33), indicating extremely low selling interest (No Supply). The bar closes significantly off the low ($121.55), confirming absorption (Test Observed). The last weekly bar is a wide spread down close (CLV 0.21) on low volume (RelVol 0.82). The bounce off the $121.55 low, combined with the low selling volume, strengthens the accumulation hypothesis.

**Key Levels:** Support: $121.55 (Monthly Low/Test Zone), Resistance: $128.30 (Recent Weekly High), High Resistance: $132.01

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry above $125.63 (the close of the test bar) on increased volume.
- **Invalidation:** $121.00 (Violation of the Test low)
---
### CCEP (NEUTRAL/BULLISH Potential)
**VSA Status:** Monthly Test Observed

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly bar closed well off its low (CLV 0.55), indicating absorption or buying near the monthly low of $84.66 (Test Observed), on below-average volume (RelVol 0.60). This suggests supply is drying up. The last weekly bar is a narrow spread up close (CLV 0.70) on high volume (RelVol 1.31), showing good follow-through demand, confirming the successful monthly test.

**Key Levels:** Support: $87.11 (Recent Weekly Low/Test Zone), Resistance: $89.68 (Recent Weekly High), High Resistance: $92.40

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry above $89.29 (the close of the test confirmation bar) on continuation volume.
- **Invalidation:** $87.00 (Violation of recent weekly low)
---
### CPRX (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Monthly No Supply / Test Observed (Accumulation Structure)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart shows a narrow spread bar (1.41) on significantly reduced volume (RelVol 0.62) closing near the low (CLV -0.19). This low volume contraction, following a period of volatility (December monthly bar spread of 2.94), suggests that supply has dried up in the area of $22.70. This 'No Supply' action, especially following a recent low, suggests a potential Test of Supply is complete.

**Key Levels:** Support: 22.13 (Monthly Low/Test Level), Resistance: 24.59 (Previous Weekly High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Daily close above 23.00 with accompanying volume increase, confirming demand.
- **Invalidation:** Weekly close below 22.10
---
### CVS (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Monthly No Supply / Test Observed (Accumulation Structure)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly bar is a narrow spread bar (3.64) on low volume (RelVol 0.46) with a weak close (CLV -0.73). This reduced volume during a price retreat indicates a 'No Supply' characteristic, suggesting institutional holders are not liquidating. This is a Test after a previous up-move in November. The weekly chart shows a high volume spike (RelVol 1.30) pushing price down to the low ($78.12) and closing near the low (CLV -0.72), indicating potential last gasp selling absorbed by demand lower down in the trading range.

**Key Levels:** Support: 78.12 (Weekly/Monthly Low), Resistance: 81.76 (Recent High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close above 80.00 on increased volume, confirming demand continuation.
- **Invalidation:** Weekly close below 78.10
---
### DKS (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Weekly No Supply (Contraction)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The latest weekly bar shows a narrow spread (11.25) and average volume (RelVol 0.83). The close is relatively high (CLV 0.51). Following a strong up-move two weeks ago, this week's action is consolidating that move on reduced volume, suggesting a healthy pullback and absence of aggressive selling (No Supply). The monthly bar also shows a poor close (CLV 0.45) but low relative volume (RelVol 0.57), indicating institutional sellers may have exited previously.

**Key Levels:** Support: 206.79 (Weekly Low), Resistance: 218.04 (Weekly High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close above 218.04 (weekly high) on surging volume.
- **Invalidation:** Weekly close below 206.70
---
### EMN (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Weekly No Supply / Test Observed

**Smart Money Logic:**
The latest weekly bar has an average spread (3.08) on below-average volume (RelVol 0.78), closing poorly (CLV -0.12). This represents a test of supply after a strong effort two weeks ago (wide spread up, high CLV, RelVol 1.03). The drop in volume on this pullback suggests 'No Supply' is being found after the previous jump. Smart Money is consolidating positions.

**Key Levels:** Support: 67.32 (Weekly Low), Resistance: 70.40 (Weekly High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close above 69.00 with high volume, confirming demand continuation.
- **Invalidation:** Weekly close below 67.30
---
### FNF (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Weekly Stopping Volume / Monthly Test Observed

**Smart Money Logic:**
The latest weekly bar shows a wide spread (3.75) on ultra-high volume (RelVol 1.81). Crucially, the price closed well off the low ($50.82) near the mid-point (CLV 0.09). This volume spike and bounce suggests heavy institutional absorption/Stopping Volume near $50.82. The monthly chart shows a narrow spread down on low volume (RelVol 0.73) closing poorly (CLV -0.33), suggesting a Test of Supply in the monthly timeframe coinciding with the weekly Stopping Volume.

**Key Levels:** Support: 50.82 (Weekly Low - Absorption Zone), Resistance: 54.57 (Recent Weekly High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A daily close above 53.50, confirming demand continuation from the absorption point.
- **Invalidation:** Weekly close below 50.80
---
### FTV (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Monthly No Supply / Test Observed (Healthy Pullback)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly bar shows a narrow spread (3.38) on low relative volume (RelVol 0.57), closing in the middle-upper range (CLV 0.36). This low volume pullback suggests 'No Supply' is being found after the strong December move. The weekly bar also shows a wide spread (1.90) on high volume (RelVol 1.11) but closes near the mid-point (CLV -0.12), which can be interpreted as absorption around the 54.13 area.

**Key Levels:** Support: 54.13 (Weekly Low), Resistance: 56.03 (Weekly High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close above 55.00 on increasing volume, confirming demand.
- **Invalidation:** Weekly close below 54.10
---
### HUM (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Weekly No Supply / Test Observed (Contraction/Pullback)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly bar is wide spread (16.40) on low volume (RelVol 0.58), closing poorly (CLV -0.50). This low volume pullback, following a strong up-move two weeks ago, suggests supply has dried up ('No Supply') and Smart Money is not selling. The monthly bar is very strong, showing a wide spread up bar on low volume (RelVol 0.29) closing well off the high (CLV 0.16). This low volume suggests smooth markup after previous accumulation.

**Key Levels:** Support: 269.21 (Weekly Low), Resistance: 285.61 (Weekly/Monthly High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close above 280.00 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** Weekly close below 269.20
---
### KDP (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Monthly No Supply / Test Observed (Accumulation Structure)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly bar is very narrow spread (1.39) on extremely low relative volume (RelVol 0.51), closing poorly (CLV -0.36). The low volume indicates a 'No Supply' condition, suggesting institutional holders are not selling despite the price decline (a Test). This follows strong prior monthly action. The weekly bar shows low volume (RelVol 0.89) on a wide spread closing poorly (CLV -0.81), indicating short-term weakness is confined to low trading activity.

**Key Levels:** Support: 27.32 (Weekly Low/Test Level), Resistance: 28.36 (Weekly High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close above 27.80 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** Weekly close below 27.30
---
### KHC (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Monthly No Supply / Test Observed (Accumulation Structure)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly bar is narrow spread (1.64) on low volume (RelVol 0.72) closing poorly (CLV -0.24). This low volume pullback signals a 'No Supply' Test following a massive accumulation effort in November/December. The weekly bar shows high volume (RelVol 1.06) driving price down, but the close is weak (CLV -0.70). However, the monthly context of low supply suggests this high weekly volume is final weak selling being absorbed.

**Key Levels:** Support: 23.36 (Weekly Low/Test Level), Resistance: 24.56 (Weekly High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close above 24.00 on strong volume, confirming demand.
- **Invalidation:** Weekly close below 23.35
---
### OMC (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Monthly No Supply / Test Observed (Continuation)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly bar is narrow spread (5.02) on low volume (RelVol 0.69), closing in the upper half (CLV 0.13). This low volume pullback after a major markup suggests a 'No Supply' Test. The lack of selling pressure indicates institutional buyers are holding. The weekly bar confirms consolidation, showing high volume (RelVol 0.98) and a close slightly above the midpoint (CLV 0.32), confirming demand is present in the pullback.

**Key Levels:** Support: 76.93 (Weekly Low), Resistance: 81.25 (Weekly High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close above 81.00 on increasing volume, confirming mark-up continuation.
- **Invalidation:** Weekly close below 76.90
---
### PAYX (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Monthly No Supply / Test Observed (Healthy Pullback)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly bar is wide spread (7.27) on low volume (RelVol 0.72), closing slightly below the midpoint (CLV -0.07). This represents a low volume pullback following a strong push up in December. The 'No Supply' suggests institutional selling is absent. The weekly bar shows high volume (RelVol 1.04) and wide spread, closing poorly (CLV -0.10), suggesting short-term supply is being met by absorption in the 108.91 area.

**Key Levels:** Support: 108.91 (Weekly Low/Absorption Zone), Resistance: 113.99 (Weekly High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close above 113.77 (previous week's close) on increasing volume.

### RDVY (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Weekly Stopping Volume (Continuation)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The latest weekly bar is a narrow spread (1.63) on ultra-high volume (RelVol 1.60), closing strongly (CLV 0.38). This high volume surge with limited spread suggests absorption of supply after a strong up-move the previous week. The price action indicates demand is successfully overcoming supply in this area, continuing the bullish trend confirmed by the strong monthly close (CLV 0.71).

**Key Levels:** Support: 71.47 (Weekly Low), Resistance: 73.11 (Weekly High)

#### Action Plan

### RRC (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Monthly Test Observed / Effort No Result (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly bar closed down mildly (CLV: 0.25) on below-average volume (RelVol: 0.70). The previous monthly bar (Dec) was a high volume down bar (RelVol: 1.28) indicating accumulation/distribution, which was followed by low volume selling pressure (Monthly Test Observed). The last weekly bar (Jan 12) was a high volume bar (RelVol: 1.25) that managed to close very high (CLV: 0.96), suggesting absorption/Stopping Volume followed by an upward recovery effort, absorbing prior selling.

**Key Levels:** Monthly Low Support: 32.68, Immediate Resistance: 35.43

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry on retest near 33.50 or a breakout above 34.50 with follow-through volume.

### RSG (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Monthly No Supply / Accumulation Detected

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly bar closed neutral/down (CLV: -0.068) on below-average volume (RelVol: 0.67), indicating Monthly No Supply. The price action in January has been consolidating after a strong December down move (CLV -0.22, RelVol 1.30). The recent weekly bar (Jan 12) was high volume (RelVol: 1.24) with a decent close (CLV: 0.13), suggesting absorption activity after the initial down move, confirming a potential test of support near 208.

**Key Levels:** Monthly Low Support: 207.90, Immediate Resistance: 214.47

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Breakout above 212.75 with strong volume confirmation.
- **Invalidation:** 207.80 (Below Monthly Low)
---
### RYAAY (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Weekly Stopping Volume / Monthly Test Observed

**Smart Money Logic:**
The current monthly bar closed down significantly (CLV: -0.69) on very low relative volume (RelVol: 0.47), indicating weak selling commitment after a major move (Monthly Test Observed). The last weekly bar (Jan 12) had high volume (RelVol: 1.58) but only a moderate close (CLV: 0.013), suggesting a high-volume down move (from 69.34 to 67.19) met significant absorption (Stopping Volume). This suggests sellers are exhausted near the 67.19 low.

**Key Levels:** Weekly Support/Stopping Volume Low: 67.19, Immediate Resistance: 69.34

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 69.34, or a bullish weekly reversal from the 67.19 area on lower volume.
- **Invalidation:** 67.00 (Below Weekly Low)
---
### SONY (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply / Shakeout

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly bar closed sharply down (CLV: -0.89) but on very low volume (RelVol: 0.69), signaling Monthly No Supply, indicating selling momentum is exhausting. The last two weekly bars show increasing volume on sharp down moves, suggesting a potential shakeout or climax near the monthly low (23.93). The last weekly bar (Jan 12) was high volume (RelVol: 1.66) and closed near its low (CLV: -0.82), pushing into monthly support, likely cleaning out weak hands.

**Key Levels:** Monthly Low Support/Shakeout Low: 23.93, Immediate Resistance: 25.33

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A bullish reversal from 24.00, or a weekly close above 25.14 on increased volume.

**VSA Status:** Weekly Stopping Volume / Selling Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last two weekly bars show ultra-high volume (RelVol: 2.72 and 1.91) on wide spreads, pushing the price down to 19.40. The Jan 5 bar showed a wide spread down on ultra-high volume, closing mid-range (CLV: 0.036), indicating major absorption (Stopping Volume). The Jan 12 bar was another high volume down bar closing near the low (CLV: -0.042), suggesting a final shakeout or Selling Climax near the monthly low. Volume exhaustion is likely imminent.

**Key Levels:** Selling Climax Low: 19.40, Immediate Resistance: 22.68

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A weekly close above 21.50 on increasing volume, or a successful low volume test of 19.40.

---
### SYF (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Weekly Stopping Volume / Shakeout

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar (Jan 12) was an ultra-high volume (RelVol: 2.17), wide-spread down bar that managed to close strongly off the low (CLV: 0.52). This is a classic indication of Stopping Volume and a major shakeout, driving the price down sharply below previous monthly lows (76.15/74.95) before being aggressively bought back. This confirms heavy accumulation activity.

**Key Levels:** Shakeout Low Support: 74.95, Immediate Resistance: 81.84

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry on any bullish follow-through above 80.50, or a low volume pullback to 79.26.

---
### TPR (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Weekly No Supply (Failure)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar (Jan 12) was a high spread down bar, closing at the absolute low (CLV: -0.98), on average volume (RelVol: 0.80). This extreme weakness signals effort (wide spread) resulting in a strong down move (CLV -0.98), indicating heavy supply commitment. The monthly volume (RelVol: 0.31) is very low for January, suggesting the distribution/down move is happening on the weekly level with little monthly noise, confirming weakness.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Resistance: 133.30, Weekly Low Support: 130.66

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 130.66 on volume, confirming follow-through selling.
- **Invalidation:** 133.30 (Above open of bearish bar)
---
### TRU (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Weekly Test / Potential Accumulation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar (Jan 12) was a moderate volume bar (RelVol: 0.64) with a decent spread, closing high (CLV: 0.66). This indicates upward effort succeeding despite the overall SPY downtrend. The prior weekly bar (Jan 5) was a high volume up bar (RelVol: 0.87) with a CLV of 0.64, suggesting strong initial demand. The current bar confirms the test of the accumulation area is holding (Weekly Test Observed). Monthly volume is low (RelVol: 0.55), supporting accumulation/consolidation.

**Key Levels:** Accumulation Support: 82.58, Recent Resistance: 87.80

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and hold above 87.80 on volume confirmation.
- **Invalidation:** 82.50 (Below recent weekly low)
---
### UNM (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Monthly Test Failure / Effort No Result (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly bar closed down (CLV: -0.66) on low volume (RelVol: 0.60), initially suggesting No Supply. However, the last weekly bar (Jan 12) was a high volume (RelVol: 1.44), wide spread down bar that closed near the low (CLV: -0.66). This is a strong Effort Down with Result, indicating renewed supply overwhelming any prior demand/test effort near 80. The monthly test of demand failed, confirming Smart Money selling.

**Key Levels:** Monthly Support: 75.07, Recent Resistance: 80.15

#### Action Plan

The monthly bar closed near the middle (CLV: -0.053) on low volume (RelVol: 0.53), confirming a test of demand holding the monthly low (224.32). The last weekly bar (Jan 12) was a high volume bar (RelVol: 1.01) that closed high (CLV: 0.29), showing demand stepped in powerfully to lift the price from the lows (225.00), suggesting accumulation near the low of the monthly range.

**Key Levels:** Monthly Accumulation Support: 224.32, Immediate Resistance: 231.92

---
### USB (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Weekly Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar (Jan 12) was an ultra-high volume bar (RelVol: 1.85) with a narrow spread, closing near the middle (CLV: 0.32). This bar occurred after a strong run up in the prior week, and the high volume suggests absorption of supply near 55.00/54.00. This is Stopping Volume, halting the downward thrust after the high volume action in December, suggesting support is building.

**Key Levels:** Stopping Volume Support: 53.23, Immediate Resistance: 55.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Bullish follow-through above 54.50, or a low volume pullback to 53.50.
- **Invalidation:** 53.00 (Below Stopping Volume Low)
---
### VKTX (BULLISH)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly bar closed positive (CLV: 0.32) on very low volume (RelVol: 0.56), confirming Monthly No Supply and a test of the support near 29.53. The weekly bar (Jan 12) was a high volume bar (RelVol: 1.31) with a wide spread, closing mid-high (CLV: 0.35). This suggests significant absorption (Stopping Volume) after the sharp drop in the prior week, successfully defending the monthly low. Smart Money is accumulating.

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry on close above 34.50, aiming for a move through 36.00.

---
### WAL (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Weekly Test / Potential Accumulation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly bar closed positively (CLV: 0.26) on very low volume (RelVol: 0.37), indicating reduced selling pressure (Monthly No Supply). The last weekly bar (Jan 12) was a moderate volume bar (RelVol: 0.68) that tested the previous accumulation high (88.60) and closed mid-range (CLV: -0.17). Although the close was slightly disappointing, the test held above the prior strong demand bar low (84.70, Jan 5), confirming accumulation is ongoing and ready for follow-through.

**Key Levels:** Accumulation Support: 86.68, Immediate Resistance: 90.77

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 88.60 with strong volume, or a tight close above 89.00.

---
### WRB (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Monthly No Supply / Selling Pressure Confirmed

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly bar closed down significantly (CLV: -0.82) on low volume (RelVol: 0.68), suggesting Monthly No Supply. However, the closing action is extremely weak, signaling continued downside momentum despite the low relative volume. The last weekly bar (Jan 12) was a down bar closing near the low (CLV: -0.71) on average volume (RelVol: 1.00), suggesting continued supply presence, failing to find demand near 67.57.

**Key Levels:** Monthly Low Support: 67.57, Immediate Resistance: 69.78

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 67.57 on volume, targeting new lows.
- **Invalidation:** 69.78 (Above recent weekly high)
---
### YOU (NEUTRAL/BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Monthly Test Observed / Potential Accumulation (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly bar closed neutral/down (CLV: -0.076) on extremely low volume (RelVol: 0.43), confirming Monthly No Supply/Test. This implies that the selling pressure has dried up. The last weekly bar (Jan 12) was a high volume bar (RelVol: 1.17) that had a wide spread but closed mid-range (CLV: 0.073), suggesting absorption/Stopping Volume near the low 33.25. Demand is trying to hold the low ground after the sharp prior down move.

**Key Levels:** Accumulation Support: 33.25, Immediate Resistance: 36.36

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A close above 35.85 with volume, or a low volume test of 34.00.
- **Invalidation:** 33.00 (Below weekly low)
---
### ZBH (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Monthly Test Failure / Effort Down with Result (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly bar closed down (CLV: -0.67) on average volume (RelVol: 0.79), indicating that the initial accumulation/test observed in December (CLV -0.69, RelVol 1.19) has failed. The last weekly bar (Jan 12) was an ultra-high volume bar (RelVol: 1.95) with a wide spread, closing near the low (CLV: -0.60). This strong effort down confirms heavy supply and selling pressure, suggesting Smart Money has failed to hold the prior low ground and is distributing.

**Key Levels:** Monthly Low Support: 85.76, Immediate Resistance: 93.62

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Confirmed break below 85.76 on volume, or failure to rise above 87.50 (No Demand).
- **Invalidation:** 93.62 (Above weekly high)
---
### ZM (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Monthly No Supply / Effort Down with Result (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly bar closed sharply down (CLV: -0.89) on very low volume (RelVol: 0.51), indicating Monthly No Supply, suggesting selling exhaustion. However, the wide spread and low close signal extreme weakness. The last weekly bar (Jan 12) confirms this weakness: high volume (RelVol: 1.09) on a wide spread, closing near the absolute low (CLV: -0.89). This is a strong Effort Down with Result, indicating that despite the overall quiet market (low monthly volume), heavy supply is active at the weekly level, pushing the price towards the low 80.58.

**Key Levels:** Monthly Low Support: 80.58, Immediate Resistance: 87.92

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Confirmed break below 80.58, or a failed rally attempt (No Demand) near 83.00.
- **Invalidation:** 87.92 (Above weekly high)

## 👀 Watch/Monitoring
### ABNB (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply (Monthly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart shows a narrow spread down close (CLV -0.86) on below-average volume (RelVol 0.53). This indicates weakness has subsided and selling pressure is minimal after the price dropped significantly from the high of $141.40. Smart Money is likely absorbing remaining supply near the monthly low ($129.85). Weekly chart shows extreme selling volume on the last bar with a wide spread down and low CLV (-0.84), confirming the current weakness but potentially exhausting sellers near the key level of $129.85.

**Key Levels:** Support: $129.85 (Monthly Low), Resistance: $139.28 (Previous Weekly Open), High Resistance: $141.40

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Weekly close above $135.72 (previous Monthly Close) on average or better volume, or a clear 'Test' on a lower timeframe.
- **Invalidation:** $128.30 (Monthly Low minus safety buffer)
---
### ABT (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply (Monthly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly candle is a wide spread down close (CLV -0.94) on below-average volume (RelVol 0.62). The wide spread suggests significant price markdown, but the low relative volume suggests that Smart Money is not participating heavily in the markdown. The down move may be exhausting selling pressure. The last weekly bar is a wide spread down close (-0.91 CLV) on high volume (RelVol 1.46), suggesting momentary selling climax near the low of the month ($121.54).

**Key Levels:** Support: $121.54 (Monthly Low), Resistance: $125.29 (Previous Weekly Close), High Resistance: $129.46

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A weekly bar closing higher than the open (positive CLV) on low volume, or a clear test/reversal pattern on the daily chart above $121.54.
- **Invalidation:** $120.00 (Break of monthly low)
---
### ACM (NEUTRAL/BULLISH Potential)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last Weekly bar is a wide spread down close (-0.08 CLV, suggesting a small recovery) on ultra-high volume (RelVol 1.90). This is Stopping Volume, indicating heavy selling pressure met with equally heavy absorption by Smart Money, attempting to halt the recent markdown from $100.56. The prior monthly trend was heavily bearish with very low CLVs, making this stopping volume significant if followed by strength.

**Key Levels:** Support: $96.09 (Stopping Volume Low), Resistance: $100.66 (Stopping Volume High), Intermediate Resistance: $99.27

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A subsequent weekly bar closing strongly up above $99.27 on average or better volume, confirming the absorption phase.
- **Invalidation:** $96.00 (Break below Stopping Volume low)
---
### ADSK (BEARISH/NEUTRAL (Weakness persists))
**VSA Status:** Monthly Test Observed

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart shows a wide spread down close (-0.66 CLV) on average volume (RelVol 0.73). This monthly bar confirms weakness after the aggressive selling observed in the prior week. Although the Monthly volume is not climactic, the wide spread down indicates that sellers remain in control. The last weekly bar is high volume (RelVol 1.94) with a wide spread down, but the CLV (-0.36) is higher than the lowest weekly close, indicating some buying attempt near the low ($259.27). This suggests a possible Test/Absorption effort, but sellers currently dominate.

**Key Levels:** Support: $259.27 (Monthly Low / Recent Low), Resistance: $279.34 (Recent Weekly High), High Resistance: $296.80

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A strong push and hold above the recent weekly high ($279.34), or a confirmed spring/test on the daily chart near $259.27.
- **Invalidation:** $259.00 (Break below the recent swing low)
---
### AER (NEUTRAL/BULLISH Potential)
**VSA Status:** No Supply / Test Observed (Monthly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart shows a down close (-0.67 CLV) on below-average volume (RelVol 0.42), indicating No Supply is present after a strong bullish run in the preceding months. The last weekly bar is a down close (-0.41 CLV) on average volume (RelVol 0.86), showing selling pressure but also a bounce from the low of the month ($141.52), suggesting Smart Money stepped in. The overall consolidation after a strong advance (November-December 2025) suggests accumulation/re-distribution, but the low volume selling is tentatively bullish.

**Key Levels:** Support: $141.52 (Monthly/Recent Low), Resistance: $145.89 (Recent Weekly High), High Resistance: $149.24

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Breakout above $145.89 on high volume, confirming continued demand.
- **Invalidation:** $141.00 (Break below monthly low)
---
### AGIO (NEUTRAL/BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply / Test Observed (Weekly & Monthly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly bar shows a narrow spread down close (-0.55 CLV) on below-average volume (RelVol 0.68), suggesting selling exhaustion (No Supply). The bar also had a small tail above the close, indicating a Test attempt. The last weekly bar closed down (-0.91 CLV) on average volume (RelVol 0.83), marking a clear effort to push the price lower but failing to widen the spread significantly, maintaining the range. The low volume selling confirms limited supply.

**Key Levels:** Support: $26.54 (Monthly Low), Resistance: $28.87 (Recent Weekly High), High Resistance: $29.44

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A strong rally above $28.41 (previous weekly close) on high volume.
- **Invalidation:** $26.50 (Break below recent support/Monthly Low)
---
### AJG (NEUTRAL/BULLISH Potential)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last Weekly bar is a wide spread down close (CLV -0.24, significant recovery from low) on very high volume (RelVol 1.73). This is classic Stopping Volume, where demand entered aggressively near the low of $253.39, halting the down move. This suggests Smart Money accumulation is occurring, absorbing supply generated by fear.

**Key Levels:** Support: $253.39 (Stopping Volume Low), Resistance: $266.87 (Recent High), Intermediate Resistance: $264.59

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A weekly close above $258.52 on average or better volume, confirming the absorption. Look for a Test on the daily chart near $253.39.
- **Invalidation:** $253.00 (Break below the Stopping Volume low)
---
### ALKT (BEARISH/NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** No Supply (Monthly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly bar shows a wide spread down close (-0.94 CLV) on below-average volume (RelVol 0.76). While the spread is wide, the volume is not climactic, suggesting weakness but not necessarily an exhaustion move. The last weekly bar is a wide spread down close (-0.89 CLV) on high volume (RelVol 1.25), indicating strong selling pressure remains dominant. Although volume is high, the wide spread down contradicts a No Supply indication for immediate reversal, suggesting weakness persists until absorption is confirmed.

**Key Levels:** Support: $19.75 (Monthly Low), Resistance: $22.21 (Recent Weekly High), High Resistance: $24.47

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a clear Stopping Volume or Test bar on the daily/weekly chart near $19.75.
- **Invalidation:** $19.70 (Break below monthly low)
---
### ALLY (BULLISH Potential)
**VSA Status:** No Supply / Test Observed (Monthly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart shows a medium spread down close (-0.75 CLV) on below-average volume (RelVol 0.54), confirming No Supply. The selling effort lacked follow-through volume, indicating Smart Money is not selling aggressively. The last weekly bar is a down close (-0.46 CLV) on high volume (RelVol 1.33). The high volume spike with a close mid-range suggests potential absorption or stopping volume activity near the low of $43.08.

**Key Levels:** Support: $43.08 (Monthly Low/Absorption Zone), Resistance: $45.05 (Recent Weekly High), High Resistance: $47.27

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A weekly bar closing higher than the open on low volume (Test), or a daily close above $45.05.
- **Invalidation:** $43.00 (Break below monthly low)
---
### AMBA (NEUTRAL/BULLISH Potential)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last Weekly bar is a medium spread up close (CLV 0.40) on ultra-high volume (RelVol 2.06). This volume spike, occurring near the low of $64.00, is Stopping Volume, indicating Smart Money aggressively absorbed supply. The bullish close, despite high selling pressure, suggests a shift in control, potentially ending the markdown phase. The prior monthly chart shows a continuation of weakness, making this Stopping Volume crucial.

**Key Levels:** Support: $64.00 (Stopping Volume Low/Monthly Low), Resistance: $70.77 (Recent Weekly High), High Resistance: $81.35

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A low volume Test on the daily/weekly chart near $64.00-$68.00, or a break above $70.77.
- **Invalidation:** $63.90 (Violation of Stopping Volume low)
---
### ANF (BULLISH Potential)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Weekly) / Monthly Test Observed

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart shows a wide spread down close (-0.69 CLV) on below-average volume (RelVol 0.61). The bar has a significant lower tail, testing the prior month's low area, indicating absorption (Test Observed). The last Weekly bar is a wide spread up close (CLV 0.10) on high volume (RelVol 1.72), which is Stopping Volume. The large effort (volume) failed to produce a strong close (CLV 0.10 is weak, but positive), suggesting heavy selling met with aggressive buying, potentially marking the bottom of the immediate correction.

**Key Levels:** Support: $98.80 (Stopping Volume Low/Monthly Low), Resistance: $108.49 (Recent Weekly High), High Resistance: $133.11

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A clear bullish signal (e.g., strong up close on low volume Test) on the daily chart near $98.80, or a break above $108.49.
- **Invalidation:** $98.50 (Violation of the Stopping Volume low)
---
### AON (BULLISH Potential)
**VSA Status:** No Supply / Test Observed (Monthly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart shows a medium spread down close (-0.44 CLV) on very low volume (RelVol 0.45). This is a strong indication of No Supply, suggesting selling interest is drying up. The bar also closes significantly off the low ($339.39), hinting at absorption. The last weekly bar is a down close (-0.51 CLV) on high volume (RelVol 1.03), confirming the recent weakness but the mid-range close suggests buying entered against the selling pressure near the key support.

**Key Levels:** Support: $339.39 (Monthly Low/Absorption Zone), Resistance: $353.93 (Recent Weekly High), High Resistance: $355.43

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A weekly bar closing above $350.80 on increasing volume, confirming demand continuation.
- **Invalidation:** $339.00 (Break below monthly low)
---
### AR (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** No Supply (Monthly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart shows a narrow spread down close (-0.27 CLV) on average volume (RelVol 0.82), confirming a lack of aggressive selling pressure (No Supply) after a significant markdown. However, the last weekly bar is high volume (RelVol 1.46) with a wide spread up close (CLV 0.02). This suggests a strong effort (volume) but poor result (narrow spread, nearly flat close), which is Effort No Result (Bearish indication). Price action is choppy, indicating uncertainty near the lows.

**Key Levels:** Support: $31.15 (Monthly Low/Recent Weekly Low), Resistance: $33.50 (Recent Weekly High), High Resistance: $34.46

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a clean break above $33.50 on high volume to confirm demand, or a clear breakdown below $31.15.
- **Invalidation:** $31.10 (Break below recent low)
---
### ARM (BULLISH Potential)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Weekly) / Monthly No Supply/Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly bar shows a wide spread down close (-0.63 CLV) on below-average volume (RelVol 0.55), indicating selling pressure is decreasing and supply is minimal (No Supply). The bar closed off the low, suggesting some absorption (Test). The last weekly bar is a wide spread down close (-0.23 CLV) on high volume (RelVol 1.54). This is Stopping Volume, indicating Smart Money absorption near the low of $102.01. The higher CLV shows rejection of the lowest prices.

**Key Levels:** Support: $102.01 (Stopping Volume Low/Monthly Low), Resistance: $111.75 (Recent Weekly High), High Resistance: $122.50

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A narrow spread up close on low volume (Test) on the daily chart near $102.01, or a strong weekly close above $111.75.
- **Invalidation:** $101.50 (Violation of Stopping Volume low)
---
### AVDL (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** No Supply / Test Observed (Monthly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart shows a very narrow spread down close (-0.20 CLV) on below-average volume (RelVol 0.75), indicating weak selling effort (No Supply). The narrow range confirms consolidation. The last weekly bar, with high volume (RelVol 1.16) and a very narrow spread down close (-0.60 CLV), suggests some momentary selling pressure, but the price remains tightly constrained near $21.50. Lack of spread widening despite high volume suggests Smart Money is controlling the range. This is a very tight consolidation/Test phase.

**Key Levels:** Support: $21.40 (Recent Low), Resistance: $21.60 (Recent High), Monthly Low: $21.40

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A clean breakout above $21.60 on strong volume. This is currently too consolidated to enter.
- **Invalidation:** $21.35 (Break below consolidation low)
---
### AXGN (NEUTRAL/BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Monthly Test Observed

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart shows a wide spread down close (-0.55 CLV) on below-average volume (RelVol 0.69). The bar has a lower tail, suggesting a Test, but the wide spread down and volume indicate selling pressure is still significant, failing to fully confirm bullish momentum. The last weekly bar is a wide spread down close (-0.42 CLV) on average volume (RelVol 0.92). The closing price is significantly off the low ($29.95), suggesting buying absorption, but the failure to close higher than the open shows current weakness dominates the week.

**Key Levels:** Support: $29.95 (Monthly Low/Absorption Zone), Resistance: $33.62 (Recent Weekly High), Intermediate Resistance: $34.71

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A strong rally and close above $33.51 (previous weekly close) on high volume.
- **Invalidation:** $29.90 (Break below absorption low)
---
### AXP (BULLISH Potential)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Weekly) / Monthly Test Observed

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart shows a wide spread down close (-0.21 CLV) on below-average volume (RelVol 0.68). The long lower tail indicates a significant Test of Supply near the low of $350.72. The last weekly bar is a very wide spread down bar, but closed well off its low (CLV 0.51) on ultra-high volume (RelVol 1.84). This is Stopping Volume, signaling aggressive absorption by Smart Money, attempting to halt the markdown.

**Key Levels:** Support: $350.72 (Stopping Volume Low/Monthly Low), Resistance: $369.40 (Recent Weekly High), High Resistance: $386.26

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A low volume Test on the daily chart near $350.72-$360.00, or a break above the stopping volume close ($364.79).
- **Invalidation:** $350.00 (Violation of the Stopping Volume low)
---
### AZN (NEUTRAL/BULLISH Potential)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly bar shows a medium spread up close (CLV 0.39) on very high volume (RelVol 1.49). The high volume spike suggests a significant event, possibly a push towards a key resistance area. The last weekly bar is a medium spread down close (-0.12 CLV) on extreme, climactic volume (RelVol 4.33). This is classic Stopping Volume/Selling Climax, indicating aggressive selling was met with strong buying absorption near the mid-range close.

**Key Levels:** Support: $92.78 (Stopping Volume Low), Resistance: $96.43 (Recent Weekly High), Intermediate Resistance: $94.65

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A strong push above $94.39 (the close of the Stopping Volume bar) on increasing volume. Look for a low volume Test on the daily chart near $92.78.
- **Invalidation:** $92.70 (Break below Stopping Volume low)
---
### BBIO (NEUTRAL/BULLISH Potential)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last Weekly bar is a wide spread down bar (CLV 0.19) on extreme, climactic volume (RelVol 2.59). The wide spread down confirms heavy selling, but the high CLV (closing significantly off the low) on climactic volume indicates aggressive buying (Stopping Volume). This suggests a potential reversal or accumulation phase near the $70.95 low.

**Key Levels:** Support: $70.95 (Stopping Volume Low), Resistance: $79.88 (Recent Weekly High), Intermediate Resistance: $77.25

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A low volume Test of Supply near the $70.95 low, or a close above $76.26 on follow-through volume.
- **Invalidation:** $70.90 (Break below Stopping Volume low)
---
### BBY (NEUTRAL/BULLISH Potential)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last Weekly bar is a wide spread down close (-0.12 CLV) on high volume (RelVol 1.63). This is Stopping Volume, indicating Smart Money absorption near the low of $66.00. The wide spread down confirms strong selling, but the close off the lows suggests demand stepped in aggressively. The monthly chart shows high CLV in the prior months, but the current month is weakening, making this Stopping Volume crucial.

**Key Levels:** Support: $66.00 (Stopping Volume Low/Monthly Low), Resistance: $70.01 (Recent Weekly High), Intermediate Resistance: $70.61

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A low volume Test on the daily/weekly chart near $66.00, or a break above the stopping volume close ($67.76).
- **Invalidation:** $65.90 (Violation of the Stopping Volume low)
---
### BFAM (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** No Supply / Test Observed (Monthly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly bar shows a wide spread down close (-0.65 CLV) on low volume (RelVol 0.68). This confirms No Supply, as the spread down was achieved with limited effort. The bar also closed significantly off the low ($94.49), indicating absorption (Test Observed). However, the last weekly bar is a wide spread down close (-0.59 CLV) on high volume (RelVol 1.17), suggesting renewed selling pressure and weakness. This is a conflicting signal, requiring caution.

**Key Levels:** Support: $94.49 (Monthly Low/Absorption Zone), Resistance: $102.93 (Recent Weekly High), High Resistance: $104.46

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A strong rally and close above $98.81 on high volume, confirming demand has overcome recent selling.
- **Invalidation:** $94.40 (Break below monthly low)
---
### BILL (BEARISH/NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** No Supply (Monthly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart shows a wide spread down close (-0.98 CLV) on below-average volume (RelVol 0.61). This signifies weakness but lack of climactic volume suggests the selling is not exhaustive yet (No Supply, but weakness persists). The last weekly bar is a wide spread down close (-0.97 CLV) on high volume (RelVol 1.15), confirming strong selling pressure continues. This is not yet stopping volume, as the close is near the low.

**Key Levels:** Support: $46.50 (Monthly Low), Resistance: $54.30 (Recent Weekly High), High Resistance: $56.44

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a clear Stopping Volume or Test bar on the daily/weekly chart near $46.50.
- **Invalidation:** $46.00 (Break below monthly low)
---
### BL (NEUTRAL/BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Monthly Test Observed

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly bar closed significantly off its low (CLV -0.51), indicating absorption or buying near the monthly low of $50.85 (Test Observed), albeit on below-average volume (RelVol 0.71). However, the last weekly bar is a wide spread down close (-0.51 CLV) on extremely high volume (RelVol 2.02). This high volume with a wide spread down and a mid-range close is ambiguous, suggesting significant conflict between supply and demand. Currently, weakness seems dominant based on the last two bars closing lower.

**Key Levels:** Support: $50.85 (Monthly Low/Test Zone), Resistance: $58.25 (Recent Weekly High), Intermediate Resistance: $56.59

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a clear confirmation bar above $52.65 or a low volume Test near $50.85.
- **Invalidation:** $50.50 (Break below monthly low)
---
### BMRN (BEARISH/NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** No Supply (Monthly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly bar shows a wide spread down close (-0.94 CLV) on below-average volume (RelVol 0.60). The wide spread down to the low ($54.36), despite low volume, indicates that selling pressure is unchallenged and No Supply confirms low demand. The last weekly bar is a wide spread down close (-0.90 CLV) on average volume (RelVol 1.02), confirming continued weakness. This is a high-probability bearish trend continuation scenario.

**Key Levels:** Support: $54.36 (Monthly Low), Resistance: $59.03 (Recent Weekly High), High Resistance: $61.88

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a clear Stopping Volume or Test bar near $54.36.
- **Invalidation:** $54.00 (Break below monthly low)
---
### CAI (NEUTRAL/BULLISH Potential)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last Weekly bar is a wide spread down close (CLV -0.03) on extremely high volume (RelVol 2.33). This is Stopping Volume/Selling Climax, where aggressive selling was met with strong buying absorption near the low of $24.69. The close is near the middle of the range, confirming the battle between buyers and sellers, but the climactic volume suggests a reversal attempt.

**Key Levels:** Support: $24.69 (Stopping Volume Low), Resistance: $29.00 (Recent Weekly High), Intermediate Resistance: $28.51

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A low volume Test on the daily/weekly chart near $24.69-$26.78, or a break above the stopping volume high ($29.00).
- **Invalidation:** $24.60 (Violation of the Stopping Volume low)
---
### CAPR (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Monthly Test Observed

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart shows a wide spread down close (-0.61 CLV) on very low volume (RelVol 0.42). The long lower tail suggests a Test of Supply near the low of $23.15, but the low relative volume indicates Smart Money is not heavily committed yet. The last weekly bar is a narrow spread up close (CLV 0.01) on low volume (RelVol 0.62). This suggests a very weak bounce and general inertia/lack of interest following the monthly test. Confirmation is needed.

**Key Levels:** Support: $23.15 (Monthly Low/Test Zone), Resistance: $25.44 (Recent Weekly High), Intermediate Resistance: $24.35

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A strong weekly close above $24.35 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** $23.10 (Break below monthly low)
---
### CART (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply (Monthly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly bar shows a wide spread down close (-0.83 CLV) on below-average volume (RelVol 0.71). The wide spread down indicates that selling pressure is unchallenged and No Supply suggests low demand. The last weekly bar is a wide spread down close (-0.74 CLV) on high volume (RelVol 1.33). This confirms strong downside momentum and supply is still dominant. Not yet a Stopping Volume signal as the close is near the low.

**Key Levels:** Support: $38.85 (Monthly Low), Resistance: $43.15 (Recent Weekly High), High Resistance: $45.31

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a clear Stopping Volume or Test bar near $38.85.
- **Invalidation:** $38.50 (Break below monthly low)
---
### CB (BEARISH/NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** No Supply (Monthly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly bar shows a medium spread down close (-0.81 CLV) on below-average volume (RelVol 0.56). This indicates weakness and limited demand (No Supply), suggesting the price is vulnerable to further markdown. The last weekly bar is a wide spread down close (-0.66 CLV) on high volume (RelVol 1.09), confirming strong selling pressure, but the close is significantly off the low ($299.03), suggesting some buying absorption.

**Key Levels:** Support: $299.03 (Monthly Low/Absorption Zone), Resistance: $309.38 (Recent Weekly High), High Resistance: $316.94

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A strong rally and close above $310.00 on high volume, confirming demand continuation.
- **Invalidation:** $298.50 (Break below monthly low)
---
### CCK (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** No Supply / Test Observed (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart shows a narrow spread up close (CLV 0.21) on very low volume (RelVol 0.48), suggesting underlying demand but lack of effort (Low Supply). The last weekly bar is a narrow spread down close (-0.23 CLV) on low volume (RelVol 0.76). This is a low volume selling attempt that failed to mark down the price significantly, confirming a No Supply condition/Test of Supply near support. The price is currently range-bound.

**Key Levels:** Support: $102.95 (Recent Weekly Low), Resistance: $106.28 (Recent Weekly High), High Resistance: $106.78

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Breakout above $104.53 on increasing volume, confirming demand continuation.

### CDW (NEUTRAL/BULLISH Potential)
**VSA Status:** No Supply / Test Observed (Monthly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart shows a wide spread down close (-0.12 CLV) on below-average volume (RelVol 0.65). The bar closed significantly off the low ($126.93), indicating a substantial Test of Supply/Absorption by Smart Money. This confirms No Supply. The last weekly bar is a medium spread down close (-0.54 CLV) on high volume (RelVol 1.12), confirming some selling pressure but also showing a mid-range close, suggesting continuous absorption near the monthly low area.

**Key Levels:** Support: $126.93 (Monthly Low/Absorption Zone), Resistance: $136.09 (Recent Weekly High), Intermediate Resistance: $133.49

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A strong rally and close above $133.49 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** $126.50 (Break below monthly low)
---
### CELC (NEUTRAL/BULLISH Potential)
**VSA Status:** Test Observed (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly bar closed well off its low (CLV -0.06), indicating absorption or buying near the monthly low of $98.50 (Test Observed), on below-average volume (RelVol 0.61). The last weekly bar is a wide spread down close (-0.18 CLV) on low volume (RelVol 0.65). The low volume selling confirms a Test of Supply and a lack of follow-through selling, despite the wide spread. The close is off the low, suggesting demand is present.

**Key Levels:** Support: $100.38 (Recent Weekly Low/Test Zone), Resistance: $116.44 (Recent Weekly High), Intermediate Resistance: $107.51

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry above $106.96 (the close of the test bar) on increased daily volume, targeting $116.44.
- **Invalidation:** $100.00 (Break below recent low)
---
### CHDN (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** No Supply / Test Observed (Monthly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart shows a wide spread down close (-0.55 CLV) on below-average volume (RelVol 0.79). The long lower tail suggests absorption or a Test of Supply near the low of $104.20. This indicates supply is limited. The last weekly bar is a wide spread down close (-0.34 CLV) on high volume (RelVol 1.44), suggesting strong selling pressure, but the mid-range close confirms demand stepped in aggressively at the lows. Conflict between supply and demand persists.

**Key Levels:** Support: $104.20 (Monthly Low/Absorption Zone), Resistance: $112.33 (Recent Weekly High), High Resistance: $116.04

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a clear sign of bullish commitment, such as a strong weekly close above $108.24.
- **Invalidation:** $104.00 (Break below monthly low)
---
### CHTR (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply (Monthly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart shows a very wide spread down close (-0.86 CLV) on below-average volume (RelVol 0.73). The wide spread down on low volume suggests institutional selling with limited demand, confirming No Supply. The last weekly bar is a very wide spread down close (-0.84 CLV) on high volume (RelVol 1.19), confirming strong selling pressure and weakness remains dominant. This is a continuation of the markdown phase.

**Key Levels:** Support: $187.85 (Monthly Low), Resistance: $211.15 (Recent Weekly High), High Resistance: $215.65

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a clear Stopping Volume or Test bar near $187.85.
- **Invalidation:** $187.00 (Break below monthly low)

### CI (NEUTRAL/BULLISH Potential)
**VSA Status:** No Supply / Test Observed (Monthly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart shows a wide spread down close (-0.68 CLV) on below-average volume (RelVol 0.53). The bar closed significantly off the low ($268.95), indicating a successful Test of Supply/Absorption by Smart Money near the key level of $268.95. This confirms No Supply. The last weekly bar is a wide spread down close (-0.38 CLV) on high volume (RelVol 1.08). The close off the low, combined with high volume, suggests demand absorption is ongoing, reinforcing the bullish outlook from the Monthly Test.

**Key Levels:** Support: $268.95 (Monthly Low/Absorption Zone), Resistance: $279.50 (Recent Weekly High), High Resistance: $289.03

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A strong rally and close above $279.12 (previous weekly close) on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** $268.50 (Break below monthly low)
---
### CIVI (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** No Supply / Test Observed (Monthly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart shows a wide spread down close (-0.38 CLV) on very low volume (RelVol 0.42). The close is off the low ($25.38), indicating a Test of Supply/Absorption. This suggests selling interest is minimal (No Supply). The last weekly bar is a narrow spread down close (-0.33 CLV) on low volume (RelVol 0.72), confirming the lack of follow-through selling and persistent No Supply conditions. Price remains consolidated near the monthly low.

**Key Levels:** Support: $25.60 (Recent Weekly Low/Test Zone), Resistance: $27.94 (Recent Weekly High), High Resistance: $28.58

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A clean breakout above $27.94 on strong volume, confirming demand has returned.
- **Invalidation:** $25.50 (Break below recent low)
---
### CLDX (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** No Supply / Test Observed (Monthly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart shows a narrow spread down close (-0.68 CLV) on very low volume (RelVol 0.50), indicating weak selling effort and limited demand (No Supply). The bar closes significantly off the low ($25.15), suggesting a successful Test. The last weekly bar is a narrow spread down close (-0.51 CLV) on average volume (RelVol 1.16). While volume is slightly elevated, the spread is narrow, confirming selling pressure is limited and the Test area holds. Price remains range-bound near accumulation zone.

**Key Levels:** Support: $25.15 (Monthly Low/Test Zone), Resistance: $27.20 (Recent Weekly High), High Resistance: $28.27

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A strong weekly close above $27.38 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** $25.10 (Break below monthly low)
---
### CNXC (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Weekly Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
The latest weekly bar shows a very wide spread (6.02) on ultra-high volume (RelVol 2.18). Price closed well off the low but significantly higher than the open (CLV 0.76). This large volume spike accompanying a wide-range downthrust into the low ($37.85) suggests institutional selling climax or major Stopping Volume. The close near the high indicates aggressive Smart Money absorption/buying overcoming the supply.

**Key Levels:** Support: 37.85 (Weekly Low), Resistance: 44.78 (Recent High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close above 44.06 (previous week's close) or a successful test of 41.50 area on low volume.
- **Invalidation:** Weekly close below 37.80
---
### CRK (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Monthly No Supply / Test Observed (Accumulation Structure)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly bar shows low relative volume (RelVol 0.57) following a significant decline in December (CLV -0.32). The latest monthly candle closes poorly (CLV -0.34) but the volume reduction confirms Smart Money is not heavily selling here. The weekly candle shows a wide spread bar into the low ($20.00) on high volume (RelVol 1.07), suggesting a potential absorption/climax, but the close is poor (CLV -0.21). The lack of high volume selling pressure on the monthly scale suggests testing is concluding near the $20.00 psychological support.

**Key Levels:** Support: 20.00 (Weekly Low/Psychological Support), Resistance: 23.60 (Recent Weekly High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Daily confirmation of demand, ideally breaking above 22.00 on strong volume.
- **Invalidation:** Weekly close below 20.00
---
### CVI (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS)
**VSA Status:** Monthly Test Observed (Weak Demand)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart shows a wide-spread down bar on below-average volume (RelVol 0.68). The close is near the low (CLV -0.40), confirming weakness. The volume profile suggests that while the intensity of selling is decreasing relative to December's large drop, the price action remains weak (Test Observed, but closing poorly). The weekly bar also shows high volume (RelVol 1.11) with a wide spread and a close near the open (CLV 0.02), indicating struggle, not clear absorption.

**Key Levels:** Support: 21.83 (Weekly Low), Resistance: 25.44 (Previous Monthly Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a clear No Supply bar followed by a break above 24.00.
- **Invalidation:** Weekly close below 21.80
---
### DELL (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS)
**VSA Status:** Monthly No Supply / Test Observed (Weakness in Short Term)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly bar is wide spread (16.40) on low relative volume (RelVol 0.51) and closes poorly (CLV -0.30). While low volume suggests supply drying up relative to previous months' volatility, the bearish close indicates continued downward pressure. The weekly bar shows a wide spread down and high volume (RelVol 1.18) closing near the low (CLV -0.09), suggesting selling is still present. This needs a stronger confirmation of absorption (e.g., a Stopping Volume bar with a high CLV) before turning bullish.

**Key Levels:** Support: 114.79 (Monthly Low), Resistance: 129.67 (Previous Weekly High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a clear demand signal or a close above 123.65 (recent high) on high volume.
- **Invalidation:** Weekly close below 114.50
---
### DVA (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS)
**VSA Status:** Monthly No Supply / Test Observed

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly bar is wide spread (14.82) on low volume (RelVol 0.64) and closes weakly (CLV -0.49). While volume is low, the price action suggests weakness extending the decline from December. The latest weekly bar shows a wide spread down on high volume (RelVol 1.41) closing near the low (CLV -0.30), indicating strong supply pressure entering the $101.00 level. Although low monthly volume suggests institutional supply is reduced, the short-term supply is heavy.

**Key Levels:** Support: 101.00 (Monthly Low), Resistance: 111.72 (Recent Weekly High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a clear reversal bar (Stopping Volume or Demand Confirmation) above 105.00.
- **Invalidation:** Weekly close below 101.00
---
### EQH (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS)
**VSA Status:** Monthly No Supply / Test Observed (Weak Demand)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly bar shows low relative volume (RelVol 0.53) but a very weak close (CLV -0.79). This indicates a lack of sustained institutional demand despite the lowered relative supply. The weekly bar confirms this weakness, showing high volume (RelVol 1.14) driving the price to the low ($46.38) with a poor close (CLV -0.66). This is clear supply in the short term, despite the long-term context of reduced volume.

**Key Levels:** Support: 46.38 (Weekly/Monthly Low), Resistance: 48.49 (Recent Weekly High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for clear demand confirmation (strong close on high volume) above 47.50.
- **Invalidation:** Weekly close below 46.30
---
### ETSY (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS)
**VSA Status:** Weekly No Supply / Test Observed

**Smart Money Logic:**
The latest weekly bar is a wide spread bar (4.47) on average volume (RelVol 0.72) closing slightly off the low (CLV -0.08). This appears to be a natural reaction back down following a high volume up-move two weeks prior (Stopping Volume/Effort to Rise). The reduced volume on the pullback suggests a 'No Supply' characteristic. However, the close below the open suggests weakness. The monthly bar is positive, indicating accumulation in the larger context.

**Key Levels:** Support: 59.72 (Weekly Low), Resistance: 64.19 (Weekly High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A close above 64.20 on high volume, confirming demand breakout.
- **Invalidation:** Weekly close below 59.70
---
### FOXA (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS)
**VSA Status:** Monthly No Supply (Selling Pressure)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly bar is a narrow spread (4.58) on low relative volume (RelVol 0.50), closing extremely weak (CLV -0.92). While volume is low, the weak close suggests strong downward pressure is finishing the monthly move. The previous month was strong (CLV 0.66). The latest weekly bar shows a wide spread down on high volume (RelVol 1.06) closing near the low (CLV -0.84), confirming strong short-term supply entering the market. This looks like a pullback, but the depth is concerning.

**Key Levels:** Support: 71.81 (Weekly Low), Resistance: 74.67 (Recent Weekly High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a clear reversal signal and close above 73.00.
- **Invalidation:** Weekly close below 71.80
---
### GEN (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS)
**VSA Status:** Monthly No Supply / Test Observed (Weak Demand)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly bar shows a narrow spread (1.54) on very low relative volume (RelVol 0.55), closing poorly (CLV -0.60). While the low volume suggests institutional supply is reduced ('No Supply'), the poor close means demand is currently absent or being quickly overwhelmed. The weekly bar confirms this, showing average spread on high volume (RelVol 1.11), closing near the low (CLV -0.80), indicating heavy short-term supply.

**Key Levels:** Support: 26.00 (Weekly Low), Resistance: 27.11 (Previous Weekly High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a clear reversal sign (strong up close on volume) above 26.50.
- **Invalidation:** Weekly close below 26.00
---
### GM (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS)
**VSA Status:** Monthly No Supply / Test Observed (Weak Demand)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly bar is wide spread (5.62) on very low volume (RelVol 0.42), closing in the lower half (CLV -0.55). This low volume retreat suggests 'No Supply', but the poor close indicates immediate demand is not stepping in forcefully. The weekly bar shows wide spread down on high volume (RelVol 1.00), closing near the low (CLV -0.67), confirming supply dominance in the short term. This is a severe test of supply in a consolidation phase.

**Key Levels:** Support: 79.56 (Monthly Low), Resistance: 85.18 (Monthly High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a clear absorption signal (high CLV on high volume) above 82.00.
- **Invalidation:** Weekly close below 79.50
---
### GSK (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS)
**VSA Status:** Monthly No Supply (Selling Pressure)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly bar is wide spread (3.37) on low relative volume (RelVol 0.60), closing extremely weak (CLV -0.92). Although volume is low, the price failure indicates persistent institutional selling pressure driving the price down. The weekly bar confirms this weakness, showing high volume (RelVol 1.34) driving the price to the low ($48.09) with a poor close (CLV -0.90). Supply is currently overwhelming demand.

**Key Levels:** Support: 48.09 (Weekly Low), Resistance: 50.87 (Recent Weekly High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a clear reversal or close above 49.50 on high volume.
- **Invalidation:** Weekly close below 48.00
---
### HALO (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS)
**VSA Status:** Weekly No Supply / Test Observed

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly bar is wide spread (3.33) on average volume (RelVol 0.79), closing poorly (CLV -0.72). This suggests a strong failure of demand following the previous week's up-move. However, the volume is not excessive, indicating supply is not aggressive. The monthly bar is also narrow/medium spread on low volume (RelVol 0.66) closing near the open (CLV -0.03), suggesting indecision and reduced institutional activity after a volatile December.

**Key Levels:** Support: 70.75 (Weekly Low), Resistance: 74.08 (Weekly High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close above 74.08 on high volume, confirming breakout.
- **Invalidation:** Weekly close below 70.70
---
### HRMY (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS)
**VSA Status:** Monthly No Supply / Test Observed (Weak Demand)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly bar is wide spread (4.72) on low relative volume (RelVol 0.64), closing poorly (CLV -0.34). This suggests institutional supply has dropped off, but the price drop confirms weakness is still prevalent. The weekly bar shows wide spread down on high volume (RelVol 1.18), closing poorly (CLV -0.34). This confirms short-term selling pressure, despite the overall low monthly relative volume context (No Supply/Test).

**Key Levels:** Support: 34.68 (Weekly/Monthly Low), Resistance: 39.40 (Weekly High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a clear reversal or close above 37.50 on high volume.
- **Invalidation:** Weekly close below 34.60
---
### JBHT (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS)
**VSA Status:** Weekly Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
The latest weekly bar shows a wide spread (11.52) on high volume (RelVol 1.50). The close is slightly above the mid-point (CLV 0.10). This volume spike accompanies a downthrust, suggesting significant absorption or Stopping Volume near the $198.00 low. However, the close is not strong enough to signal immediate demand dominance, placing it in a cautious category until confirmation.

**Key Levels:** Support: 198.01 (Weekly Low - Absorption Zone), Resistance: 209.53 (Weekly High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close above 206.85 (previous week's close) on strong volume.
- **Invalidation:** Weekly close below 198.00
---
### KYMR (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS)
**VSA Status:** Monthly No Supply (Weakness)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly bar is wide spread (8.84) on very low relative volume (RelVol 0.62), closing extremely weak (CLV -0.89). While the volume drop suggests less institutional supply, the price action is profoundly bearish, indicating distribution pressure. The latest weekly bar confirms this with a wide spread down and low volume (RelVol 0.84), closing at the absolute low (CLV -0.96). This is clear weakness, despite the low volume characteristic.

**Key Levels:** Support: 69.08 (Monthly Low), Resistance: 77.92 (Recent Monthly High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a clear reversal or close above 72.00 on high volume.
- **Invalidation:** Weekly close below 69.00
---
### L (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS)
**VSA Status:** Monthly No Supply / Test Observed (Weak Demand)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly bar is wide spread (5.02) on low volume (RelVol 0.55), closing poorly (CLV -0.76). This suggests a successful Test of Supply (low volume), but the negative close indicates demand is currently weak, allowing price to retreat. The weekly bar shows average volume (RelVol 1.20) driving price down, but the close is poor (CLV -0.62). This suggests short-term supply is heavy, testing the accumulation range boundary.

**Key Levels:** Support: 101.89 (Weekly/Monthly Low), Resistance: 105.11 (Recent Weekly High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close above 104.58 (previous week's close) on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** Weekly close below 101.85
---
### M (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS)
**VSA Status:** Monthly Test Observed (Weak Demand)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly bar is wide spread (2.88) on low relative volume (RelVol 0.59), closing in the lower half (CLV -0.58). This suggests a Test of Supply, but the weakness in the close indicates poor demand response in this area. The weekly bar confirms this with high volume (RelVol 1.13) driving price down, closing poorly (CLV -0.22). This high volume on the down bar suggests continued selling/distribution.

**Key Levels:** Support: 21.14 (Weekly/Monthly Low), Resistance: 22.81 (Recent Weekly High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a clear absorption signal above 22.00.
- **Invalidation:** Weekly close below 21.10
---
### MAT (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS)
**VSA Status:** Weekly No Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
The latest weekly bar is a narrow spread (0.88) on average volume (RelVol 0.84), closing near the low (CLV -0.74). This weak close suggests supply has entered the market (or demand has failed). Although the volume is slightly low relative to the overall range, the poor price movement indicates weakness. The monthly chart shows low relative volume (RelVol 0.50) but an up close (CLV 0.07), indicating potential accumulation but short-term selling is immediate.

**Key Levels:** Support: 20.93 (Weekly Low), Resistance: 21.81 (Weekly High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close above 21.81 on high volume.
- **Invalidation:** Weekly close below 20.90
---
### NICE (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS)
**VSA Status:** Monthly No Supply (Weakness)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly bar is wide spread (9.07) on very low volume (RelVol 0.81), closing poorly (CLV -0.36). While volume is low, the price drop signals a potential failure of demand. The weekly bar confirms this, showing wide spread down on ultra-high volume (RelVol 1.83) closing poorly (CLV -0.36). This high volume selling pressure suggests a shakeout or Stopping Volume, but the close near the midpoint is ambiguous; immediate follow-through demand is required.

**Key Levels:** Support: 109.30 (Weekly Low), Resistance: 118.37 (Weekly High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close above 115.00 on strong volume, confirming absorption.
- **Invalidation:** Weekly close below 109.20
---
### NTAP (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS)
**VSA Status:** Monthly No Supply (Weakness)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly bar is wide spread (7.07) on low relative volume (RelVol 0.68), closing extremely weak (CLV -0.86). This implies supply has dried up ('No Supply'), but the lack of demand resulted in a weak close. The weekly bar shows wide spread down on high volume (RelVol 1.44), closing near the low (CLV -0.88). This indicates strong short-term selling pressure, testing the long-term support levels.

**Key Levels:** Support: 103.35 (Weekly/Monthly Low), Resistance: 110.42 (Weekly High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a clear reversal or close above 107.50 on high volume.
- **Invalidation:** Weekly close below 103.30
---
### ONON (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS)
**VSA Status:** Monthly No Supply / Test Observed (Weak Demand)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly bar is wide spread (6.86) on low volume (RelVol 0.59), closing poorly (CLV -0.75). This low volume suggests a 'No Supply' test after a massive up-move in November. However, the weak close suggests demand is currently absent, allowing price to retreat sharply. The weekly bar shows wide spread down on high volume (RelVol 1.12), closing poorly (CLV -0.72). Supply is dominant in the short term.

**Key Levels:** Support: 44.21 (Weekly Low/Test Level), Resistance: 50.29 (Weekly High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a clear reversal sign (Stopping Volume or close above 47.00).
- **Invalidation:** Weekly close below 44.20
---
### PTC (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS)
**VSA Status:** Monthly No Supply / Test Observed (Weak Demand)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly bar is wide spread (12.05) on very low volume (RelVol 0.56), closing poorly (CLV -0.56). This low volume suggests a Test of Supply, but the close in the bottom half indicates current lack of demand response. The weekly bar shows wide spread down on high volume (RelVol 1.48), closing poorly (CLV -0.34). This high volume implies short-term supply is heavy, pressing the price lower.

**Key Levels:** Support: 164.15 (Weekly/Monthly Low), Resistance: 172.03 (Recent Weekly High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a clear reversal signal (strong close on high volume) above 168.00.
- **Invalidation:** Weekly close below 164.00
---
### PTGX (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS)
**VSA Status:** Monthly No Supply / Test Observed (Weak Demand)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly bar is wide spread (9.40) on low volume (RelVol 0.57), closing poorly (CLV -0.31). This signals a 'No Supply' Test, but the weak close indicates demand is currently weak, allowing price to retreat. The weekly bar confirms this with high volume (RelVol 0.88) on a wide spread, closing poorly (CLV -0.25). This high volume suggests supply is still present in the short term, testing the accumulation range boundary.

**Key Levels:** Support: 78.75 (Weekly Low/Test Level), Resistance: 87.44 (Weekly High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close above 83.00 on increasing volume, confirming demand.
- **Invalidation:** Weekly close below 78.70
---
### PYPL (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS)
**VSA Status:** Monthly No Supply / Test Observed (Weak Demand)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly bar is narrow spread (3.89) on low relative volume (RelVol 0.74), closing poorly (CLV -0.66). This is a low volume pullback (No Supply/Test), but the poor close indicates demand is not active enough to stabilize the price effectively. The weekly bar shows high volume (RelVol 1.26) on a narrow spread, closing poorly (CLV -0.19). This suggests supply is active, pushing the price lower towards the test level.

**Key Levels:** Support: 56.24 (Weekly Low/Test Level), Resistance: 57.86 (Recent Weekly High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a clear reversal sign (strong up close on volume) above 58.00.
- **Invalidation:** Weekly close below 56.20
---
### RDNT (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS)
**VSA Status:** Monthly No Supply (Weakness)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly bar is wide spread (10.90) on low volume (RelVol 0.57), closing poorly (CLV -0.87). This implies supply has dried up ('No Supply'), but the weak close indicates that demand is not yet committed. The weekly bar shows wide spread down on high volume (RelVol 1.14), closing near the low (CLV -0.87). This confirms strong short-term supply pressure, testing the long-term support levels.

**Key Levels:** Support: 70.54 (Weekly Low), Resistance: 77.85 (Weekly High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a clear reversal or close above 73.00 on high volume.
- **Invalidation:** Weekly close below 70.50
---
### REGN (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly bar closed down significantly (CLV: -0.86) on below-average volume (RelVol: 0.66), suggesting weak selling pressure (Monthly No Supply). The preceding weekly bar (Jan 12) was a high-volume down bar (RelVol: 1.41) with a low CLV (-0.84), potentially indicating a shakeout or stopping volume near a major support area, despite the weekly closing low. Smart Money is absorbing supply at lower levels.

**Key Levels:** Monthly Low Support: 726.43, Weekly High Resistance: 811.09

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Strong bullish weekly bar closing above the preceding down bar's midpoint (768.76) or breaking 785.
- **Invalidation:** 726.00 (Below Monthly Low)
---
### RLI (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly bar closed down (CLV: -0.58) on below-average volume (RelVol: 0.84), showing a lack of committed selling (Monthly No Supply). The weekly chart shows a sequence of down bars on moderate volume. The last weekly bar (Jan 12) had a small spread and closed near the midpoint/low (CLV: -0.008) on moderate volume (RelVol: 1.12), potentially testing the low of the down move (58.20). Selling pressure appears to be diminishing after the prior high volume down move in December.

**Key Levels:** Monthly Low Support: 58.20, Recent Resistance: 63.74

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A definitive weekly change of character, specifically a bullish close above 60.52 on high volume.
- **Invalidation:** 58.00 (Below Monthly Low)
---
### RTO (NEUTRAL/BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Weekly Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar (Jan 12) showed high volume (RelVol: 2.29) with a wide spread, but closed neutral (CLV: 0.16). This high volume on the downside move suggests heavy supply entered the market, which was absorbed near the low (30.62). This bar acts as potential Stopping Volume after the push from 29.70 to 32.20. The prior monthly bar (Jan 1) was strong up (CLV 0.52). Needs confirmation that the selling is over.

**Key Levels:** Weekly Support: 30.62, Recent Resistance: 32.20

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Successful test of the 30.62 level on low volume, followed by a bullish turn, or a move above 31.80.
- **Invalidation:** 30.50 (Below Stopping Volume Low)
---
### RYTM (NEUTRAL/BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Monthly Test Observed / Selling Climax (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly bar closed down (CLV: -0.38) on below-average volume (RelVol: 0.59), following a major down bar in December (RelVol: 1.63). This low volume descent indicates a lack of follow-through selling (Monthly Test). The last two weekly bars show intense selling pressure followed by confusion. The Jan 12 weekly bar was a very wide spread, high volume down bar (RelVol: 0.90) closing near the low (CLV: -0.71), indicating a possible selling climax if the volume was higher (Relative to the previous week it was moderate). Focus remains on the monthly test confirmation.

**Key Levels:** Monthly Low Support: 96.20, Recent Pivot High: 114.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A weekly bar closing decisively above the 105 level with confirmed follow-through volume, or a second low volume test near 99.57.
- **Invalidation:** 96.00 (Below Monthly Low)
---
### SSNC (NEUTRAL/BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Monthly Test Observed / Weakness (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly bar closed down (CLV: -0.47) on low volume (RelVol: 0.61), suggesting a lack of strong selling (Monthly No Supply). However, the preceding action (Dec) was high volume distribution (CLV 0.07, RelVol 0.96) after a big rally. The last weekly bar (Jan 12) was a high volume down bar (RelVol: 1.46) with a close near the low (CLV: -0.11), indicating continued weakness and failure to hold the high ground. The Monthly 'Test' is showing a negative result.

**Key Levels:** Monthly Low Support: 84.49, Immediate Resistance: 87.40

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A confirmed bullish reversal above 87.40. Bearish entry on breach of 84.49.
- **Invalidation:** 84.40 (Below Monthly Low)
---
### TD (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Monthly Test Observed / No Demand (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly bar closed down (CLV: -0.22) on below-average volume (RelVol: 0.74), suggesting weak selling pressure (Test Observed). However, the last weekly bar (Jan 12) was a moderate volume bar (RelVol: 1.29) that made an upward effort but closed near the middle/low (CLV: 0.12). This indicates supply is still present (No Demand near the high 94.88) or the previous down move was absorption/shakeout. We need more decisive movement.

**Key Levels:** Monthly Support: 92.22, Immediate Resistance: 94.88

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 94.90 on increased volume, confirming demand.
- **Invalidation:** 92.20 (Below Monthly Low)

### THC (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Monthly No Supply / Weakness Confirmed

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly bar closed down significantly (CLV: -0.68) on very low volume (RelVol: 0.35), indicating Monthly No Supply. However, the closing price is far from the open/high, and the trend is sharply down since December's high volume down bar (RelVol: 0.64, CLV: -0.63). The weekly action (Jan 12) shows a high spread down bar (8.67 spread) closing low (CLV: -0.37) on average volume (RelVol: 0.90). This confirms continued bearish pressure despite the monthly low volume. The Monthly 'Test' failed.

**Key Levels:** Monthly Resistance: 202.71, Monthly Support/Test Low: 194.04

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Bearish entry on breach of 194.00, or a confirmed weekly No Demand bar near 199.00.
- **Invalidation:** 202.71 (Above previous weekly high)
---
### TMO (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Weekly Stopping Volume / Buying Climax (Monthly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The current monthly bar closed very strong (CLV: 0.57) but on low relative volume (RelVol: 0.75), which can be interpreted as potential Buying Climax exhaustion following the big move from 577 to 629. The last weekly bar (Jan 12) was a high volume bar (RelVol: 1.70) with a wide spread, but closed neutral/mid-range (CLV: 0.37). This high volume selling/absorption indicates supply entered at the high (629.87), suggesting Stopping Volume or heavy distribution is beginning.

**Key Levels:** Distribution/Stopping Volume High: 629.87, Immediate Support: 594.30

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Bearish entry on a close below 610, or a clear failure to breach 630 on low volume.
- **Invalidation:** 630.00 (Above recent high)

### TSLR (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Monthly/Weekly No Supply/Test (Continued Weakness)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly bar closed down (CLV: -0.31) on very low volume (RelVol: 0.34), confirming Monthly No Supply—sellers are not committed. However, the weekly price action shows continued vulnerability. The last weekly bar (Jan 12) was a down bar closing low (CLV: -0.71) on moderate volume (RelVol: 0.63). This suggests that while volume is low (No Supply), the underlying structure is weak and failing to find solid demand, testing previous lows (29.61). The multiple 'No Supply' readings confirm weakness but suggest a major move may require higher volume confirmation.

**Key Levels:** Monthly Low Support: 28.35, Immediate Resistance: 32.41

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 29.61, or a failed test (No Demand) near 31.00.
- **Invalidation:** 32.41 (Above weekly high)

### UPS (NEUTRAL/BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Weekly Test/Failure

**Smart Money Logic:**
The January monthly bar was strong up (CLV 0.50) on low volume (RelVol 0.51), suggesting buying exhaustion at the high. The last weekly bar (Jan 12) was a high spread down bar on average volume (RelVol: 0.77), closing mid-low (CLV: -0.46). This downward move from the 109 high suggests supply has entered, turning the prior week's strong move (Jan 5 CLV 0.64) into a potential trap. The weekly 'Test' failed to hold the high ground.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Support: 106.15, Immediate Resistance: 108.99

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Confirmed drop below 106.00, indicating weakness. Bullish entry requires reclaim of 109.00.
- **Invalidation:** 109.00 (Above recent high)
---
### WMG (NEUTRAL/BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Monthly Test Observed / Weakness (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly bar closed neutral/down (CLV: 0.12) on low volume (RelVol: 0.56), indicating a lack of committed selling (Monthly Test Observed). However, the last weekly bar (Jan 12) was an average volume bar (RelVol: 1.01) with a wide spread, closing low (CLV: -0.64). This indicates supply entered aggressively above 31.00, pushing the price lower, confirming weakness after the preceding bullish effort (Jan 5 CLV 0.87).

**Key Levels:** Immediate Resistance: 31.62, Support Level: 30.37

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 30.37 with increased volume, confirming distribution.
- **Invalidation:** 31.62 (Above weekly high)
---
### WYNN (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Monthly No Supply / Weakness Confirmed

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly bar closed sharply down (CLV: -0.89) on very low volume (RelVol: 0.29), indicating Monthly No Supply, meaning sellers are largely exhausted, but Smart Money is not yet stepping in decisively. The last weekly bar (Jan 12) was a down bar closing very low (CLV: -0.78) on average volume (RelVol: 0.85). This confirms underlying weakness and a failure to hold any rally attempts, pushing price toward the monthly low (113.81). The overall lack of demand remains concerning.

**Key Levels:** Monthly Low Support: 113.81, Immediate Resistance: 118.75

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 113.81, confirming downside continuation.
- **Invalidation:** 118.75 (Above weekly high)

### YPF (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Monthly No Supply / Weakness Confirmed

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly bar closed down (CLV: -0.21) on very low volume (RelVol: 0.43), indicating Monthly No Supply. However, the selling pressure is confirmed on the weekly chart. The last weekly bar (Jan 12) was a moderate volume bar (RelVol: 0.73) closing near the low (CLV: -0.057). This follows a sharp high volume down bar (Jan 5, CLV -0.31) that reached the monthly low (32.74). The failure to rally effectively suggests continuing weakness, even if the overall volume is subdued (Test Failure).

**Key Levels:** Monthly Low Support: 32.74, Immediate Resistance: 35.42

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 33.32 on volume, confirming downside continuation.
- **Invalidation:** 35.42 (Above weekly high)

### YUMC (NEUTRAL/BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Monthly Test Observed / Weakness (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly bar closed down (CLV: -0.27) on very low volume (RelVol: 0.25), indicating Monthly No Supply/Test. However, the last weekly bar (Jan 12) was a high volume bar (RelVol: 1.00) with a wide spread down, closing near the low (CLV: -0.56). This effort confirms significant supply entering the market, overriding the low monthly volume 'No Supply' signal. Weakness is confirmed at the weekly level, threatening the support zone.

**Key Levels:** Monthly Low Support: 46.55, Immediate Resistance: 49.30

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Confirmed break below 47.06 on volume, or failure to rally above 48.00.
- **Invalidation:** 49.30 (Above weekly high)

**VSA Status:** Monthly No Supply (Heavy Selling)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly bar is wide spread (9.45) on low relative volume (RelVol 0.53) and closes extremely weak (CLV -0.96). While the low relative volume suggests the massive institutional selling from November/December has subsided, the price action is heavily bearish, confirming continued distribution pressure. The weekly bar shows wide spread down on high volume (RelVol 1.17) closing near the low (CLV -0.95), confirming strong short-term supply.

**Key Levels:** Support: 71.22 (Weekly/Monthly Low), Resistance: 78.70 (Recent Weekly High)

**VSA Status:** Monthly Test Observed (Significant Weakness)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly bar is wide spread (11.72) on low relative volume (RelVol 0.65) closing extremely weak (CLV -0.78). This is a strong indication of distribution or mark-down phase, despite the reduction in institutional volume compared to previous months. The latest weekly bar confirms this with high volume (RelVol 1.27) driving the price to the low ($98.60) with a poor close (CLV -0.60). Supply is dominant.

**Key Levels:** Support: 98.60 (Weekly/Monthly Low), Resistance: 105.15 (Recent Weekly High)

While technically lower volume than December, the close is profoundly bearish, suggesting a continuation of the distribution/markdown phase. The latest weekly bar shows a wide spread down on high volume (RelVol 1.44), closing at the absolute low (CLV -0.98). This is clear, aggressive supply.

**Key Levels:** Support: 73.76 (Weekly/Monthly Low), Resistance: 79.89 (Recent Weekly High)

### HIMS (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Monthly No Supply / Test Observed (Distribution in Progress)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly bar is wide spread (6.53) on low volume (RelVol 0.40), closing poorly (CLV -0.55). While volume is low, the context is a significant markup failure (November $48 high) and persistent down-moves. The low volume suggests a quiet market but the price action is heavily biased downwards, indicating distribution is likely ongoing quietly. The weekly bar confirms this with high volume (RelVol 0.87) and wide spread, closing near the low (CLV -0.12), indicating selling pressure is still strong.

**Key Levels:** Support: 29.92 (Weekly/Monthly Low), Resistance: 33.27 (Recent Weekly High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 29.90 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** Weekly close above 32.50

This is extremely bearish, indicating a clear markdown phase with little institutional buying interest. The weekly bar confirms this severe weakness, being a narrow spread bar but closing at the low (CLV -0.96) on average volume (RelVol 0.60). This suggests a lack of buying interest and potential continuation downwards.

#### Action Plan

The low volume suggests reduced institutional activity, but the price drop confirms continued weakness/distribution. The weekly bar confirms this, showing average volume (RelVol 1.14) driving the price to the low ($31.19) with a poor close (CLV -0.72). Supply is dominant in the short term.

**Key Levels:** Support: 31.19 (Weekly/Monthly Low), Resistance: 32.24 (Recent Weekly High)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly bar is wide spread (24.97) on low relative volume (RelVol 0.49), closing poorly (CLV -0.68). This indicates that while institutional volume has dropped off, the downward pressure is still dominant, suggesting a successful test has confirmed weakness. The weekly bar is wide spread down on high volume (RelVol 1.22), closing poorly (CLV -0.37). This indicates strong supply is active in the short term, driving the price lower.

**Key Levels:** Support: 180.23 (Weekly/Monthly Low), Resistance: 192.76 (Recent Weekly High)

**VSA Status:** Monthly No Supply / Test Observed (Distribution in Progress)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly bar is wide spread (20.93) on extremely low volume (RelVol 0.34), closing poorly (CLV -0.55). The low volume suggests low institutional activity after a significant volatility period, but the sustained drop in price indicates institutional support is absent and distribution is ongoing. The weekly bar shows ultra-high volume (RelVol 1.01) on a wide spread, closing poorly (CLV -0.84). This confirms strong supply overwhelming any demand.

**Key Levels:** Support: 170.01 (Weekly Low), Resistance: 182.50 (Recent Weekly High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 170.00 on increasing volume.

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly bar is wide spread (8.18) on low volume (RelVol 0.68), closing extremely weak (CLV -0.97). Although volume is low, the price collapse signals a severe failure of demand and likely institutional selling. The weekly bar confirms this weakness, showing high volume (RelVol 1.67) and wide spread, closing at the absolute low (CLV -0.97). This is clear, aggressive supply driving the price down.

**Key Levels:** Support: 111.61 (Weekly Low), Resistance: 119.00 (Weekly High)

Despite low volume, the price inability to hold suggests supply dominance.

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly bar is wide spread (7.61) on extremely low volume (RelVol 0.42), closing extremely weak (CLV -0.94). This suggests institutional supply has dried up, but the price action is profoundly bearish, indicating distribution pressure. The weekly bar confirms this with a wide spread down on low volume (RelVol 0.57), closing at the absolute low (CLV -0.92). This is clear weakness with no demand stepping in.
