- **Invalidation:** 46.61
---
### BAH (BEARISH)

- **Invalidation:** 103.00
---
### BAM (BULLISH)

- **Invalidation:** 131.00

- **Entry Trigger:** Failure to hold 18.75 or a weak rally on low volume
- **Invalidation:** 25.10
---
### BRZE (BEARISH)

- **Invalidation:** 21.00
---
### CALM (NEUTRAL)

The latest week saw a high-volume attempt to move higher that failed, closing near the low (CLV -0.93). This indicates hidden supply at the $89 level.

- **Invalidation:** 79.00

- **Invalidation:** 22.30
---
### CDNS (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
The effort to stop the fall (RelVol 2.22) resulted in only a weak close (CLV 0.23). This indicates that despite some buying, the overhead supply is still significantly heavy.

**Key Levels:** 262.75, 296.34, 328.64

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Rejection at 296.00
- **Invalidation:** 310.00
---
### CIVI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

- **Invalidation:** 29.50

- **Invalidation:** 33.50

- **Invalidation:** 29.60
---
### CSGP (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

- **Entry Trigger:** Breakdown below 48.50
- **Invalidation:** 57.00

- **Invalidation:** 137.00
---
### EGO (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
A high-volume test of the lows resulted in a neutral close. While professional buying is likely present at $36, the overhead supply from the Jan 26 week is significant.

- **Invalidation:** 120.00

### GWRE (BEARISH)

- **Invalidation:** 20.60

---
### ING (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
High relative volume (1.95) on the latest weekly move up with a low CLV (-0.28) indicates professional selling into public buying. Supply has overcome demand at these heights.

- **Invalidation:** 31.25

### IONQ (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Distribution

**Smart Money Logic:**
Massive volume on wide down-spreads over the last two weeks with very low CLVs suggests aggressive institutional liquidation. Smart money is exiting positions rapidly.

- **Invalidation:** 16.70
---
### IOT (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
High volume (RelVol 2.29) at the low of 23.37 suggests potential professional absorption, but the CLV remains weak (-0.09). We need to see a successful test of this volume.

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A low-volume test of the 23.50 area followed by a bullish engulfing bar
- **Invalidation:** 23.20
---
### IQV (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Major price collapse on massive relative volume (2.31). While the CLV is -0.60, the spread is too wide to be anything other than a breakdown in institutional support.

- **Entry Trigger:** Confirmation of lower highs on low volume
- **Invalidation:** 230.15

- **Invalidation:** 55.75

- **Entry Trigger:** Failure to hold the 100 level
- **Invalidation:** 116.10
---
### KVYO (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
Heavy volume on the drop. While stopping volume is flagged, the extremely weak CLV (-0.76) suggests that demand has not yet stepped in with enough conviction to halt the slide.

**Key Levels:** 18.57, 19.14, 22.03

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a successful low-volume test of 18.50

### LHX (NEUTRAL)

- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for higher lows
- **Invalidation:** 25.00
---
### NICE (BULLISH)

- **Invalidation:** 21.30

### PEGA (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

### PPL (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Absorption

**Smart Money Logic:**
Significant volume increase (RelVol 1.89) at the 35 level. The fact that the price isn't falling further despite high volume suggests professionals are buying the supply.

### PRU (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
RelVol 2.41 on a wide-spread down bar. Institutions are heavily selling. Support at 98 must hold to avoid a deeper collapse.

**Key Levels:** 98.80, 102.80, 112.49

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Look for Selling Climax
- **Invalidation:** 113.00
---
### PSN (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Demand

- **Entry Trigger:** Price breaking below 67.00
- **Invalidation:** 70.50

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for RelVol > 1.2 and a break of 86.50
- **Invalidation:** 80.00
---
### PYPL (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
Extraordinary volume spike (RelVol 3.40) on the latest week. This level of panic selling (14 point spread) into potential support often marks a significant bottoming process.

**Key Levels:** 38.88, 40.42, 53.44

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A low-volume test bar that closes in the upper half of its range
- **Invalidation:** 38.50
---
### QQQI (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
Volume surge (RelVol 1.73) on a down bar, but price held near 53. Professional support is present, but momentum remains down.

**Key Levels:** 51.83, 53.05, 54.35

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Recross above 53.50
- **Invalidation:** 51.80
---
### RARE (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply

**Key Levels:** 23.56, 24.70, 25.82

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Breakout above 26.00
- **Invalidation:** 23.50
---
### RGTI (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
RelVol is very low (0.16) on the monthly view. Smart money is not participating in the recent weakness, suggesting a lack of selling pressure at these levels.

**Key Levels:** 14.83, 17.71, 18.38

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a high-volume 'Effort to Rise' bar
- **Invalidation:** 14.50
---
### RKT (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Dead Cat Bounce

**Smart Money Logic:**
Price recovery occurred on low volume (RelVol 0.65 monthly). This indicates the recent move up is merely a correction in a heavy downtrend.

**Key Levels:** 17.05, 17.93, 21.19

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Selling signal if price hits 20.00 on low volume
- **Invalidation:** 21.50
---
### RLI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Monthly trend is down with high volume. Weekly recovery is weak with CLVs near zero. Professional interest is absent.

**Key Levels:** 58.15, 61.72, 62.78

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Further decline expected; look for 55.00
- **Invalidation:** 63.00
---
### RTO (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
Extreme volume spike on the latest week (RelVol 2.86) with a very low CLV (0.20). Professionals are unloading shares at the 32.00 level.

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on break of 31.00
- **Invalidation:** 32.70
---
### RVMD (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** No Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
Following a monthly Buying Climax, price experienced a sharp correction. The most recent weekly bar shows a significant reduction in volume (RelVol 0.79) with a narrowing spread, suggesting that the immediate selling pressure is exhausting (No Supply) as it approaches the quarterly bullish trend base.

**Key Levels:** $93.02, $101.93, $124.49

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Bullish reversal bar on increased volume above $100
- **Invalidation:** $92.50
---
### SATS (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Wide spread down bars on high relative volume (1.78) indicate that supply is overwhelming demand. The low CLV (-0.38) on the most recent bar suggests sellers are still in control despite the bullish quarterly context.

**Key Levels:** $106.60, $113.22, $132.25

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** None - Avoid until Stopping Volume appears
- **Invalidation:** $123.00
---
### SPOT (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
A massive vertical drop on ultra-high volume (RelVol 2.58) with a very low CLV indicates panic selling. While professionals may be starting to scale in, the momentum is too negative for a safe entry; supply has not yet been tested.

**Key Levels:** $405.00, $491.30, $500.35

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a successful low-volume test of $405
- **Invalidation:** $513.00
---
### SSNC (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
The dramatic increase in volume (RelVol 2.81) on the recent plunge to $70.88, followed by a bounce, suggests professional absorption. The spread is wide, but the volume magnitude indicates the 'Selling Climax' phase.

**Key Levels:** $70.89, $77.39, $81.89

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Low volume test of $71-73 area
- **Invalidation:** $70.88
---
### STAA (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Consistent negative CLV across weekly and monthly timeframes on above-average volume. Price is making lower lows with no signs of absorption or demand entering the market.

**Key Levels:** $16.94, $19.00, $20.97

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** None
- **Invalidation:** $19.66
---
### TROW (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The most recent weekly bar is a 'Transfer of Ownership' from strong to weak hands. Extremely high volume (RelVol 2.12) on a wide spread down-bar closing near the low (CLV -0.62) indicates heavy selling pressure.

**Key Levels:** $91.70, $94.58, $103.64

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** None
- **Invalidation:** $105.70
---
### TRU (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
Massive volume at the $65.23 low with a recovery to close higher in the range (RelVol 1.75). This indicates professional entry, but the massive spread suggests it will require a secondary test of the lows to confirm a bottom.

**Key Levels:** $65.23, $73.48, $78.59

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Successful test of $68 on low volume
- **Invalidation:** $65.23
---
### UBER (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Price is falling on increasing relative volume (1.86) with closes consistently near the low of the bar. No signs of stopping volume or professional support are currently visible.

**Key Levels:** $71.88, $80.05, $81.89

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** None
- **Invalidation:** $80.00
---
### UGI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
A textbook bearish VSA bar: wide spread down, volume above average, and a CLV of -1.0 (closed at the absolute low). This confirms that supply is fully in control and lower prices are likely.

**Key Levels:** $36.57, $37.09, $41.34

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** None
- **Invalidation:** $39.00
---
### UNH (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
The volume on the $280 break was astronomical (RelVol 2.97). While this often signals a climax, the follow-through last week was also negative. Supply is too heavy to catch this knife until a low-volume 'Test' bar occurs.

**Key Levels:** $266.29, $276.65, $331.02

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for 'No Supply' test
- **Invalidation:** $300.00
---
### USIG (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** No Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
Extreme low volatility and narrowing spreads on average volume. Price is being maintained by professionals, but there is a lack of aggressive demand to drive a breakout.

**Key Levels:** $51.43, $51.72, $51.94

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** High volume breakout above $51.95
- **Invalidation:** $51.40
---
### VLTO (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Wide spread down bar on high relative volume (2.22) with a negative CLV. The breakdown from the $97 support level was decisive, indicating smart money has exited positions.

**Key Levels:** $88.40, $90.57, $98.98

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** None
- **Invalidation:** $97.00
---
### VONG (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Price is rolling over on increased volume. The current weekly bar shows a failure to hold higher levels with an increase in selling pressure (RelVol 1.52).

**Key Levels:** $114.49, $117.49, $121.09

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** None
- **Invalidation:** $120.78
---
### WGMI (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Shakeout

**Smart Money Logic:**
A major intra-week shakeout to $34.99 on high volume, which then recovered significantly by the monthly close (CLV 0.52). This suggests 'bag holding' is occurring, but the trend needs to stabilize.

**Key Levels:** $34.99, $40.43, $45.06

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Low volume pullback to $38
- **Invalidation:** $34.99
---
### WMG (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
RelVol 2.34 on the last bar but with a spread that failed to close low (CLV 0.32). This absorption of supply at the $26.42 level suggests professional accumulation is beginning.

**Key Levels:** $26.42, $29.05, $30.67

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Successful test of $27-28 on low volume
- **Invalidation:** $26.42
---
### WRB (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
Price is drifting sideways to up on very low relative volume (0.72). This lack of volume on up-bars indicates that smart money is not participating in the move, making the rally suspicious.

**Key Levels:** $65.02, $68.58, $71.90

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** None
- **Invalidation:** $67.25
---
### Z (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The breakdown on RelVol 2.09 with a very low CLV (-0.74) indicates that institutional selling is picking up speed. The trend is firmly bearish with no signs of stopping volume yet.

**Key Levels:** $53.61, $54.97, $62.66

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** None
- **Invalidation:** $63.03
