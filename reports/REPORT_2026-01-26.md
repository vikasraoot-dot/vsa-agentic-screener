## 🚀 Ready for Entry
### ABVX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort to Rise Fails / Confirmation of Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence confirmed a Buying Climax. The last two weeks saw high volume efforts (13.4M, 5.3M) but failed to sustain gains. The most recent week (Jan 19) shows a down move from open (CLV 0.38, but close near the middle/low relative to the high spread), on lower volume (RelVol 0.77). This suggests Smart Money is not supporting the high price levels following the initial climax/shakeout period (Jan 5 and Jan 12 wide spread bars). Quarterly and Monthly context remain bearish/climax, suggesting distribution is active.

**Key Levels:** 125.86 (Recent High Resistance), 113.64 (Swing Low Support), 148.83 (Climax High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on failure to break 125.86 or a break and sustained move below 113.64.
- **Invalidation:** Sustained move above 130.00.
---
### AEO (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Absorption / Effort No Result (Down)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is Bullish, but Monthly is in a BUYING_CLIMAX. The last weekly bar is a wide spread down, closing near the absolute low (CLV -0.95) on average volume (RelVol 0.86). This marks a sharp reversal from the recent high (26.69 to 24.13). The entire monthly candle (Jan) closed low on higher volume, confirming distribution/profit taking after a strong run up. Smart Money is selling into strength.

**Key Levels:** 26.69 (Recent Resistance), 24.07 (Immediate Support), 23.87 (Key Quarterly Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A break and close below 24.07, confirming markdown continuation.
- **Invalidation:** A decisive recovery and close above 26.00.
---
### AEVA (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Extreme Down Bar

**Smart Money Logic:**
Both Weekly and Monthly sequences show Supply Dominance/Buying Climax. The recent weekly action (Jan 5, Jan 12) was extremely volatile, suggesting massive liquidation/distribution following a large run-up. The last weekly bar is a wide spread down, closing at the absolute low (CLV -0.98) on high volume (RelVol 1.45). This is strong confirmation of supply overriding demand. The attempt to mark up (Jan 5 high) failed spectacularly.

**Key Levels:** 22.62 (Selling Climax High), 15.76 (Immediate Support Break), 12.30 (Prior Accumulation Zone)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry below the low of the current bar, targeting 12.30.
- **Invalidation:** A rally back above 18.50.
---
### AIG (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Down Bar

**Smart Money Logic:**
AIG is in a Quarterly BEARISH_TREND, and the weekly sequence confirms SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The last three weeks have seen heavy selling pressure. The last bar is a down bar on high volume (RelVol 0.85) with the close near the low (CLV -0.12, but reflecting heavy intra-week selling). The wide spread down on Jan 5 (RelVol 1.8) closing near the low indicated serious markdown initiation. The subsequent rally attempt failed (Jan 19 high vs close).

**Key Levels:** 73.70 (Immediate Resistance), 71.24 (Recent Low Support), 85.69 (Prior Distribution High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A clean break and close below 71.24.
- **Invalidation:** A close back above 75.00.
---
### ALC (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Up Bar / Increased Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly Trend is BULLISH. Monthly sequence is CONFIRMED_EARLY STOPPING_VOLUME (implying accumulation). The last weekly bar is an up bar, closing near the middle (CLV 0.04) on higher-than-average volume (RelVol 0.83). The price action from the Jan 5 low (78.48) shows demand re-emerging, successfully shaking out weak hands on Jan 12 (wide spread down, closing low, but high volume). The recent close suggests strength, ready for potential markup.

**Key Levels:** 82.50 (Resistance), 78.26 (Immediate Support), 76.73 (Stopping Volume Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry on a sustained move above 80.50, targeting the 82.50 high.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 78.00.
---
### AMBA (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Down Bar

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BEARISH, and Supply Dominance is confirmed. After the large high volume down bar on Jan 5 (RelVol 1.8), suggesting strong distribution, the subsequent up attempt failed (Jan 12, CLV 0.39, but still relatively low close). The last bar (Jan 19) is a down bar on reduced volume (RelVol 0.87), closing near the low (CLV -0.36, relative to the spread). This confirms continued supply/weakness in the context of a bearish trend. Smart Money is still liquidating positions.

**Key Levels:** 71.40 (Immediate Resistance), 65.24 (Immediate Support/Demand), 64.00 (Recent Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below 65.24.
- **Invalidation:** A strong rally and close above 71.40.
---
### AMH (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Test of Supply / Up Bar

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly Trend is BULLISH, and the weekly sequence is STOPPING_VOLUME (watching for test). The massive volume on Jan 5 (RelVol 2.5) indicates Smart Money buying at the low (28.85). The subsequent bar (Jan 12) was a very strong up-bar closing at the high (CLV 0.90) on high volume (RelVol 1.54), confirming demand. The last bar is a narrow spread up-bar (CLV 0.07) on slightly decreased volume (RelVol 1.12), acting as a low-volume Test/Consolidation confirming the absorption of residual supply.

**Key Levels:** 32.65 (Resistance/High), 31.50 (Immediate Support), 28.85 (Stopping Volume Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry on a breakout above 32.65, or a low volume pullback to 31.50.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 31.00.
---
### APGE (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Down Bar

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly Trend is BEARISH, confirmed by Weekly SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. After several weeks of mixed, consolidating price action (72-84 range), the last bar delivered a strong breakdown. The bar is a wide spread down, closing near the absolute low (CLV -0.71) on high volume (RelVol 2.18). This confirms aggressive selling/liquidation, breaking the recent range lows. Smart Money is marking price down.

**Key Levels:** 84.56 (Resistance), 75.01 (Prior Support), 67.97 (New Low/Target)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on any relief rally towards 72.00, or a continued break below 67.97.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 75.00.
---
### ARE (BULLISH (Potential Climax Warning))
**VSA Status:** Effort to Rise / Climactic Up Bar

**Smart Money Logic:**
ARE is in a strong BULLISH_TREND. The last weekly bar is a wide spread up, closing near the high (CLV 0.96) on high volume (RelVol 1.10). This is strong demand, driving price up. However, the monthly sequence has a STOPPING_VOLUME flag, suggesting the rally might be approaching an exhaustion point soon. For now, demand is firmly in control, confirmed by the strong monthly CLV (0.98).

**Key Levels:** 59.76 (Immediate Resistance), 56.00 (Immediate Support), 53.15 (Key Demand Line)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry on continuation above 59.76, assuming momentum persists.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 56.00.
---
### ARES (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax Confirmation / Extreme Down Bar

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly Trend is BULLISH, but the Monthly is flagged as BUYING_CLIMAX. The last weekly bar is a wide spread down, closing near the absolute low (CLV -0.97) on average volume (RelVol 0.76). This sharp reversal from the recent high (177.72) is a strong confirmation of the Buying Climax distribution phase. The effort to rise failed miserably, indicating Smart Money has liquidated positions, leaving price vulnerable to markdown.

**Key Levels:** 177.72 (Distribution High), 166.43 (Prior Support Break), 155.74 (New Low/Target)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on a break below 155.74.
- **Invalidation:** A decisive close back above 167.00.
---
### ARM (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Absorption / Strong Up Bar

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly Trend is BEARISH, but the weekly sequence is flagged as BUYING_CLIMAX (WTC). The Jan 12 bar saw high volume markdown (RelVol 1.33). The most recent bar (Jan 19) is a massive wide spread up, closing near the middle (CLV 0.22) on exceptional volume (RelVol 1.90). This extreme volume and strong spread suggests intense demand and massive absorption of supply, potentially signaling an immediate reversal or a substantial rally phase, despite the bearish quarterly context. The strength is undeniable.

**Key Levels:** 123.50 (Resistance), 104.41 (Immediate Support/Demand), 102.01 (Low of Climax)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry on volume confirmation above the high of the current bar (123.50), or a low volume Test (No Supply) pullback towards 110.00.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 104.00.
---
### AS (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort to Rise / Strong Close

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly Trend is BULLISH, though Monthly is CONFIRMED_EARLY SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The last bar is a strong up bar, closing near the absolute high (CLV 0.98) on high volume (RelVol 0.98). This is an excellent sign of demand absorption, potentially confirming a successful Test of the recent supply zone (35.54 low on Jan 19). Smart Money has stepped in to initiate a markup phase.

**Key Levels:** 38.73 (Resistance), 36.45 (Immediate Demand), 35.54 (Climax Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry on continuation above 37.74 or a low volume Test back towards 36.50.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 36.11.

### ATO (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Down Bar

**Smart Money Logic:**
ATO is in a Quarterly BEARISH_TREND, and Weekly is SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The Jan 12 bar was a major effort to rise, closing very high (CLV 0.89) on high volume (RelVol 1.25). However, the last bar (Jan 19) completely negated that effort with a wide spread down, closing near the low (CLV -0.58) on even higher volume (RelVol 2.15). This is a strong Effort No Result or Upthrust after distribution, signaling dominant supply and failed bullish attempts. Smart Money is selling heavily.

**Key Levels:** 172.08 (Resistance/Upthrust High), 163.57 (New Low/Target), 166.70 (Support Break)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on a break below 163.57.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 170.00.

### AVAV (BEARISH (Climactic Reversal))
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Extreme Down Bar

**Smart Money Logic:**
AVAV is in a BULLISH_TREND, but the Monthly is flagged as BUYING_CLIMAX. The recent action has been parabolic and highly volatile. The last bar (Jan 19) is an enormous wide spread down, closing near the absolute low (CLV -0.82) on high volume (RelVol 1.59). This confirms a massive selling climax and distribution event, marking the probable end of the aggressive markup phase (Jan 5-12). Smart Money has executed a huge trap/shakeout.

**Key Levels:** 408.25 (Climax High), 300.00 (Immediate Support), 268.00 (Key Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on a break and sustained close below 300.00, confirming the markdown.
- **Invalidation:** A close back above 380.00.
---
### AXTI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Extreme Down Bar

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly Trend is BULLISH, but both Monthly (Buying Climax) and Weekly (Supply Dominance) point to distribution. Following the parabolic move on Jan 5 (RelVol 3.82), the last bar (Jan 19) is a wide spread down, closing near the absolute low (CLV -0.86) on high volume (RelVol 1.43). This is strong confirmation of aggressive distribution and markdown initiation, likely concluding the buying climax phase. Smart Money has reversed direction.

**Key Levels:** 26.66 (Climax High), 17.01 (New Low/Target), 20.81 (Support Break)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on a break below 17.00.
- **Invalidation:** A decisive close back above 22.00.
---
### AZN (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Test of Supply / Strong Close

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly Trend is BULLISH, Monthly/Weekly is STOPPING_VOLUME (watching for test). The massive volume on Jan 12 (RelVol 3.30) marked a potential shakeout, closing low but absorbing supply. The last bar (Jan 19) is a strong recovery bar, closing near the high (CLV 0.97) on high volume (RelVol 1.22). This suggests the Jan 12 action was a successful low-volume shakeout of weak holders, followed immediately by professional demand. Strong accumulation confirmed.

**Key Levels:** 96.51 (Resistance), 92.77 (Immediate Support), 89.04 (Shakeout Low/Demand Zone)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry on continuation above 93.00, or a low volume pullback to 91.50.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 89.04.
---
### BE (BEARISH (Climactic Reversal))
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Down Bar Reversal

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly Trend is BULLISH, but the Monthly is STOPPING_VOLUME (watching for test). Price has entered a parabolic phase (Jan 5 and Jan 12 wide spread up, high volume). The last bar (Jan 19) is a wide spread down, closing near the low (CLV -0.21) on average volume (RelVol 0.77). This is a strong immediate reversal signal following extreme upward momentum. This is likely Smart Money liquidating into the strength, marking a Buying Climax, despite the initial 'Stopping Volume' flag being associated with demand.

**Key Levels:** 155.87 (Climax High/Supply), 137.76 (Immediate Support), 128.45 (Prior Demand)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on a break below 137.76, confirming markdown.
- **Invalidation:** Close back above 150.00.
---
### BFH (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Extreme Down Bar

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly Trend is BULLISH, Monthly is STOPPING_VOLUME. After a high-volume shakeout/stopping action on Jan 12 (RelVol 2.26, closing high), the market reversed sharply. The last bar (Jan 19) is a wide spread down, closing near the absolute low (CLV -0.91) on decreased volume (RelVol 0.87). This negates the bullish indication from the prior week and suggests that the institutional action on Jan 12 was a failure of demand, leading to continued markdown. The inability to rally confirms supply is dominant.

**Key Levels:** 74.17 (Resistance), 68.57 (Immediate Support), 67.78 (New Low/Demand Test Zone)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on break below 67.78.
- **Invalidation:** Close back above 72.00.
---
### BKKT (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Extreme Down Bar

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly Trend is BEARISH, Monthly is SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. After the massive run-up and high volume on Jan 5/12, which suggested climax selling/distribution, the last bar (Jan 19) confirmed the supply. It is a wide spread down, closing near the absolute low (CLV -0.72) on high volume (RelVol 0.89). This confirms markdown initiation and rejection of the recent high. The price could quickly fall back to the 10.00 area.

**Key Levels:** 22.11 (Climax High), 14.50 (Immediate Support), 16.37 (Prior Support Break)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on break below 14.50.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 17.50.
---
### BNS (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Strong Up Bar / High Close

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly Trend is BULLISH. Despite the Weekly SUPPLY_DOMINANCE flag, the last bar is a strong wide spread up, closing very near the high (CLV 0.89) on average volume (RelVol 0.86). This marks a strong recovery from the shakeout low on Jan 5 (RelVol 1.88). The immediate supply has been absorbed, and demand is now firmly in control, suggesting continuation of the markup phase.

**Key Levels:** 74.98 (Resistance), 72.93 (Immediate Support), 71.63 (Shakeout Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry on continuation above 75.00.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 73.50.
---
### BP (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Up Bar / Strong Close

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly Trend is BULLISH. Weekly is flagged as SUPPLY_DOMINANCE, but the latest bar is contradictory. It's a strong up bar, closing very near the high (CLV 0.78) on average volume (RelVol 1.02). This action effectively absorbs the supply seen in the Jan 5 bar (high volume down). The price is now challenging the high end of the recent consolidation, indicating strong intent from Smart Money to resume the markup phase.

**Key Levels:** 36.71 (Resistance/High), 35.03 (Immediate Support), 33.40 (Prior Shakeout Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry on a break and sustained move above 36.71.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 35.00.
---
### CADE (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Extreme Down Bar

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly Trend is BULLISH, but Monthly is BUYING_CLIMAX. The Jan 12 bar saw high volume (RelVol 1.19) but failed to close strong (CLV 0.64). The last bar (Jan 19) is a massive wide spread down, closing near the absolute low (CLV -0.98) on high volume (RelVol 1.43). This confirms the Buying Climax/Distribution phase is active and successful, marking a violent reversal and markdown initiation.

**Key Levels:** 46.74 (Climax High/Supply), 42.88 (Immediate Support), 42.32 (Monthly Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on break below 42.88.
- **Invalidation:** Close back above 44.50.
---
### CAI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Extreme Down Bar

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly Trend is BEARISH, Weekly is STOPPING_VOLUME. After the Jan 5 bar that suggested absorption (RelVol 1.94, CLV 0.47), the last two weeks have been heavily supplied. The Jan 19 bar is a wide spread down, closing near the low (CLV -0.76) on decreased volume (RelVol 1.29). This confirms markdown. The rally effort failed, and supply quickly returned, suggesting the Jan 5 demand was not strong enough to overcome the bearish monthly context (Supply Dominance).

**Key Levels:** 29.32 (Resistance), 24.74 (Immediate Support), 25.00 (Current Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on break below 24.74.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 27.00.
---
### CBRL (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Extreme Down Bar

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly Trend is BULLISH, Monthly is SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The last bar is a massive wide spread down, closing near the absolute low (CLV -0.87) on average volume (RelVol 0.85). This move wipes out the gains from the high volume rally in the preceding two weeks (Jan 5/12). This confirms that the rally into the 36.63 resistance failed, and Smart Money has initiated aggressive markdown, confirming the monthly distribution signal.

**Key Levels:** 36.63 (Resistance/High), 29.94 (Immediate Support), 29.80 (Prior Support Break)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on break below 29.94.
- **Invalidation:** Close back above 33.00.
---
### CELC (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Demand Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
The market is in a Monthly SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (WATCH_FOR_TEST), but the last weekly bar showed a strong UP move (Spread 9.69) closing high (CLV 0.457) on high volume (RelVol 0.82). This suggests demand is returning to absorb overhead supply after the price pulled back from a large spread bar two weeks prior. The rally confirms underlying strength against the dominant monthly signal.

**Key Levels:** 116.44 (Recent Resistance), 103.00 (Recent Low/Support), 110.00 (Psychological Level)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $112.69 (Previous high) with confirmation of follow-through demand.
- **Invalidation:** $103.00 (Below recent accumulation area)
---
### CGON (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result / Supply Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly bar shows High Volume (RelVol 1.88) on an Up bar, but the close is significantly lower (CLV -0.51). This is a clear Effort No Result, indicating strong selling pressure into the high. This confirms the Weekly and Quarterly SUPPLY_DOMINANCE status following a massive volume spike two weeks ago (RelVol 2.29), signaling a potential top or major distribution phase after a strong rally from $39.

**Key Levels:** 57.88 (All-time high/Supply), 52.51 (Immediate Support), 49.14 (Previous Consolidation Area)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $53.00, confirming the bearish structure.
- **Invalidation:** $57.88 (Above the supply peak)
---
### CMPO (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax Confirmation / No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Weekly status is BUYING_CLIMAX (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The last bar came on High Volume (RelVol 2.22) but resulted in a narrow spread bar closing near the low (CLV -0.12), following the massive volume spike/spread expansion the previous week (RelVol 3.54). This is severe lack of demand follow-through after peak buying, suggesting distribution. The lack of upward progress on peak volume confirms the buying climax.

**Key Levels:** 26.50 (High of Buying Climax), 24.09 (Immediate Support), 22.17 (Prior breakout pivot)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $24.09 on increasing selling volume.
- **Invalidation:** $26.50 (Above the Buying Climax high)
---
### CNQ (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Reverse)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Weekly status is STOPPING_VOLUME, but the price closed very high (CLV 0.87) on average volume (RelVol 0.97), indicating powerful demand absorption. The previous week was a strong up move, and this bar continued the strong upward momentum. The earlier high volume bar four weeks ago (RelVol 2.04, Low close) might have been stopping volume at a temporary low ($30.13), which was confirmed by subsequent demand. Current price action indicates follow-through strength.

**Key Levels:** 36.28 (New High/Target), 34.10 (Immediate Support), 31.91 (Major Swing Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Continuation move above $36.30 on rising volume.
- **Invalidation:** $34.09 (Below immediate support)
---
### CNXC (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Weekly status is STOPPING_VOLUME. The massive volume two weeks ago (RelVol 1.97) led to a down bar closing high (CLV 0.76), successfully testing the lows. The most recent bar shows high CLV (0.60) on an UP bar with lower volume (RelVol 0.83), indicating a successful test of supply (Lower volume on the rally means less resistance). This confirms absorption around the $38-$40 area, setting up for a sustained rally.

**Key Levels:** 44.78 (Resistance/Target), 39.99 (Low of recent stopping volume), 37.85 (Major Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close above $44.06 (Previous high) with rising volume.
- **Invalidation:** $39.98 (Below the recent low test)
---
### CORT (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Upthrust Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
Despite the Quarterly BEARISH_TREND, the last weekly bar showed a huge spread up (11.04) closing very high (CLV 0.84) on high volume (RelVol 2.34). This powerful demand surge occurred immediately after the prior week's down bar which tested the low ($34.54). This looks like a powerful stopping volume signature, suggesting Smart Money entered heavily near $34. The massive drop three weeks ago (RelVol 5.58) was likely a shakeout/climax event.

**Key Levels:** 44.84 (Immediate Resistance/New High), 33.80 (Stopping Volume Low), 38.20 (Previous Pivot Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Consolidation above $44.00 followed by a breakout, or a successful low-volume test near $40.
- **Invalidation:** $33.79 (Below the stopping volume low)
---
### ENR (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result / Supply Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The previous two weeks failed to hold strength after a high volume up bar three weeks ago (RelVol 0.98, CLV 0.98). The last bar is a clear down bar, closing low (CLV -0.69) on High Volume (RelVol 1.03). This confirms rejection and supply coming in, specifically testing the high volume effort two weeks ago (RelVol 0.88). The Quarterly BULLISH_TREND is facing a strong test here.

**Key Levels:** 21.65 (Resistance/Supply), 19.63 (Immediate Support), 18.92 (Swing Low Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $19.63 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** $20.49 (Above recent failed high)
---
### EQH (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Shakeout

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH, and the Weekly sequence is SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The last bar showed very high volume (RelVol 1.86) on a Wide Spread down bar closing near the low (CLV -0.35). This signals sustained selling pressure and Smart Money pushing the price lower, especially after the attempted rally failed two weeks prior. The weakness is pronounced and confirmed by volume.

**Key Levels:** 46.99 (Immediate Resistance), 45.00 (New Low/Support), 47.97 (Previous Pivot)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $45.00 on sustained volume.
- **Invalidation:** $46.99 (Above the previous high)
---
### FFIV (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result / Supply Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly status is STOPPING_VOLUME (WATCH_FOR_TEST), implying prior weakness. The last two weeks show rejection: two weeks ago was a large up spread with high volume (RelVol 1.22) closing low (CLV -0.54), followed by the most recent week, which was a wide down spread bar closing low (CLV -0.59) on average volume (RelVol 0.84). This confirms supply pressure returning after failure to hold the high ground. The previous high volume spike was likely distribution.

**Key Levels:** 280.75 (Resistance/Supply), 257.17 (Immediate Support), 268.22 (Previous Low Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $257.17 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** $267.41 (Above recent minor pivot)
---
### FISV (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Demand Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly context is SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (WATCH_FOR_TEST). However, the price is showing immediate recovery after a shakeout. Two weeks ago was a high volume down bar (RelVol 1.41) closing low (CLV -0.82), which appeared bearish, but the last week was a very strong UP bar closing near the high (CLV 0.95) on average volume (RelVol 0.81). This suggests the prior week was a shakeout, and demand is quickly reasserting control.

**Key Levels:** 70.41 (Resistance), 64.18 (Shakeout Low/Support), 67.63 (Immediate Pivot)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $68.00 with sustained volume, confirming the rebound.
- **Invalidation:** $64.18 (Below the shakeout low)
---
### FORM (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result / Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Weekly status is SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The price saw a massive high volume bar (RelVol 1.98) that was a wide spread up, but it closed at the extreme low of the bar (CLV -0.96). This is an undeniable Effort No Result, signaling heavy distribution and supply coming into the market, likely marking a significant top near $85.50. This confirms the bearish weekly signal.

**Key Levels:** 85.49 (Major Supply/Peak), 73.01 (Immediate Support), 67.63 (Prior Breakout Level)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $73.00 on increasing selling volume.
- **Invalidation:** $85.49 (Above the supply peak)
---
### FRPT (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Demand Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly status is STOPPING_VOLUME (CONFIRMED_EARLY), suggesting strength below. The last weekly bar was an aggressive UP bar (Spread 9.5) closing high (CLV 0.69) on High Volume (RelVol 1.11). This is a strong indicator of demand stepping in and breaking through resistance. The price successfully moved away from the prior low accumulation zone.

**Key Levels:** 72.99 (New High/Target), 63.48 (Immediate Support), 60.97 (Major Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Continuation above $73.00, or a low volume pullback to $70.
- **Invalidation:** $63.48 (Below recent support pivot)
---
### GBCI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly context is SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The last weekly bar was a large UP bar on High Volume (RelVol 1.46), but the close was in the lower portion (CLV -0.32). This is a clear Effort No Result, confirming that supply is active near the $50.92 high, likely stalling the current rally phase. Smart Money is selling into the strength.

**Key Levels:** 50.92 (Resistance/Supply), 46.50 (Immediate Support), 47.86 (Previous Low Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $47.50, confirming supply.
- **Invalidation:** $50.92 (Above the supply peak)
---
### GE (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result / Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Weekly status is SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The last bar was an extremely wide DOWN bar, closing near the low (CLV -0.77) on Ultra High Volume (RelVol 2.28). This signals panic selling or institutional liquidation, confirming the dominant supply that has been accumulating over the past weeks. This is a decisive break to the downside after the price failed to maintain momentum above $330.

**Key Levels:** 328.09 (Resistance), 290.07 (New Low/Support), 316.36 (Previous consolidation low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $290.00, confirming continuation.
- **Invalidation:** $323.88 (Above the selling pivot)
---
### GKOS (NEUTRAL/BEARISH WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result / Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly status is BUYING_CLIMAX (WATCH_FOR_TEST). Two weeks ago saw a massive spread up on high volume (RelVol 1.25) closing very high (CLV 0.89), suggesting a climatic move. The last bar was a narrower UP bar on High Volume (RelVol 1.01) but closed significantly lower in the range (CLV -0.71). This is a textbook Effort No Result, indicating that the institutional buyers from the previous week failed to sustain the rally and met aggressive supply/distribution at $130.23.

**Key Levels:** 130.23 (Buying Climax Peak/Supply), 118.26 (Immediate Support), 109.07 (Major Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $118.26 on increasing selling volume.
- **Invalidation:** $130.23 (Above the supply peak)
---
### HDB (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Weekly status is SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The last three bars show institutional selling: three weeks ago was a high volume down bar (RelVol 2.88, CLV -0.90), followed by two bars consolidating lower on high volume (RelVol 1.28, 1.51). The latest bar closed high (CLV 0.09) but remains in the low range established by the massive down move, indicating distribution pressure is ongoing. The market is struggling severely to rally off the lows.

**Key Levels:** 32.66 (Immediate Resistance), 31.34 (New Low/Support), 33.59 (Prior Pivot)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $31.34 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** $32.66 (Above immediate resistance)
---
### IMAX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH, and the Monthly status is STOPPING_VOLUME (WATCH_FOR_TEST). Two weeks ago showed high volume demand (RelVol 1.22, CLV 0.90), suggesting a rally attempt. However, the latest bar reversed sharply, closing near the low (CLV -0.82) on strong spread and average volume (RelVol 0.90). This confirms rejection at the high and returning supply dominance, nullifying the stopping volume attempt.

**Key Levels:** 37.86 (Resistance/Supply), 34.30 (Immediate Support), 33.00 (Major Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $34.30 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** $37.86 (Above the resistance high)
---
### INTC (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result / Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Weekly status is SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The bar is defined by extreme volume (RelVol 2.10) on a huge spread UP bar, but the close is near the extreme low (CLV -0.87). This is a classic and decisive Effort No Result, signaling catastrophic distribution by Smart Money into peak euphoria, effectively marking a major top near $54.60. The Monthly CLV (-0.13) confirms heavy selling pressure in January.

**Key Levels:** 54.60 (Major Supply/Peak), 44.45 (Immediate Support), 46.96 (Previous Low Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $44.45 on sustained heavy selling volume.
- **Invalidation:** $54.60 (Above the distribution peak)
---
### IONQ (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result / Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly status is BUYING_CLIMAX (CONFIRMED_EARLY). The last weekly bar was a large spread DOWN bar closing mid-to-low range (CLV -0.63) on Ultra High Volume (RelVol 0.81). This is a definitive sign of Smart Money exiting (distribution) after an attempt to push higher failed at $54.24. The volume indicates a change of character from bullish absorption to institutional liquidation.

**Key Levels:** 54.24 (Buying Climax Peak/Supply), 45.69 (Immediate Support), 47.33 (Previous Low Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $45.69 on sustained selling volume.
- **Invalidation:** $54.24 (Above the supply peak)
---
### IONX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance Confirmation / Shakeout

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Weekly status is SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The last weekly bar was a wide DOWN bar, closing mid-range (CLV -0.63) on Ultra High Volume (RelVol 1.85). This confirms aggressive selling pressure, likely absorbing weak hands after the price failed to hold the rally two weeks ago (CLV 0.30). Despite the close not being at the extreme low, the high volume on the wide down spread confirms institutional commitment to the downside.

**Key Levels:** 30.51 (Resistance), 21.51 (New Low/Support), 26.86 (Previous Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $21.51 on follow-through volume.
- **Invalidation:** $25.37 (Above recent low pivot)
---
### IOT (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Demand / Supply Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly status is BUYING_CLIMAX (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The last weekly bar was a narrow spread DOWN bar, closing mid-range (CLV -0.33) on High Volume (RelVol 1.16). This signals a failure to follow through after the rally two weeks ago (CLV 0.37). The volume is increasing, but the price is moving lower, confirming active selling pressure. The low close/spread combo suggests No Demand and vulnerability to further downside.

**Key Levels:** 33.82 (Immediate Resistance), 31.25 (New Low/Support), 34.89 (Previous Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $31.25 on high volume.
- **Invalidation:** $33.82 (Above recent consolidation high)
---
### IREN (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Demand Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly context is SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (WATCH_FOR_TEST), but the weekly action is strongly bullish. The last weekly bar was a large UP bar, closing high (CLV 0.61) on Ultra High Volume (RelVol 1.30). Although the high volume suggests some supply absorption, the ability of the price to close high, following a massive up bar the previous week (CLV 0.85, RelVol 1.19), confirms aggressive, dominant demand. Smart Money is clearly accumulating and pushing the price higher.

**Key Levels:** 58.75 (Recent High/Target), 54.95 (Immediate Support), 48.83 (Prior Pivot Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close above $58.75 on sustained volume.
- **Invalidation:** $54.95 (Below recent demand area)
---
### JPM (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance Confirmation / Effort No Result

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Weekly status is SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The last bar was an aggressive DOWN bar, closing near the low (CLV -0.83) on high volume (RelVol 1.19). This signals heavy institutional selling, confirming the supply dominance noted by the algorithm. This decisive move lower breaks key support established two weeks ago, confirming distribution has ended the prior rally phase.

**Key Levels:** 311.15 (Immediate Resistance), 296.51 (New Low/Support), 326.86 (Prior Peak)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $296.51 on sustained volume.
- **Invalidation:** $311.15 (Above immediate resistance)

### KVYO (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Demand Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Weekly status is STOPPING_VOLUME. Two weeks ago was a decisive shakeout (CLV -0.96) on high volume (RelVol 1.02). The most recent bar is a wide UP bar, closing mid-range (CLV 0.40) on Ultra High Volume (RelVol 0.96). This high volume demand surge confirms the prior shakeout was a Selling Climax/Stopping Volume event. Smart Money is now actively buying and marking up the price from the recent low.

**Key Levels:** 26.73 (Immediate Resistance), 23.00 (Stopping Volume Low/Support), 28.65 (Prior Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close above $26.73 on rising volume.
- **Invalidation:** $23.00 (Below the stopping volume low)
---
### LQDA (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Demand Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly status is SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (CONFIRMED_EARLY), but the weekly action is bullish. The last bar was an UP bar with a wide spread, closing mid-range (CLV 0.21) on high volume (RelVol 0.90). Crucially, the prior two bars tested the $34.37 support zone aggressively with high volume. This recent demand suggests accumulation finished successfully below $35, and the current rally is likely the start of a markup phase, overriding the monthly bearish context for now.

**Key Levels:** 42.46 (Resistance/Target), 37.67 (Immediate Support), 34.37 (Major Accumulation Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close above $41.57 on rising volume.
- **Invalidation:** $37.67 (Below immediate support)
---
### MOD (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Demand Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Weekly status is STOPPING_VOLUME. The price saw a massive down bar three weeks ago (RelVol 2.84) followed by a strong recovery bar (RelVol 0.97, CLV 0.70). The most recent bar is an aggressive UP bar, closing high (CLV 0.46) on lower volume (RelVol 0.79). This confirms demand has overcome the significant supply. The action suggests that the drop to $111.18 was a Selling Climax/Shakeout, and Smart Money is now marking up the price.

**Key Levels:** 150.75 (Resistance/Target), 132.80 (Immediate Support), 122.21 (Major Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close above $150.75 with sustained volume.
- **Invalidation:** $132.80 (Below recent accumulation pivot)
---
### MSFU (BULLISH WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly status is STOPPING_VOLUME (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The last weekly bar was an aggressive UP bar (Spread 5.07), closing high (CLV 0.68) on Ultra High Volume (RelVol 2.44). This powerful demand surge occurred directly off the low ($33.85) established the previous week, indicating major institutional support entering the market (Stopping Volume). This is a strong change of character from the prevailing bearish quarterly trend.

**Key Levels:** 38.92 (Immediate Resistance), 33.85 (Stopping Volume Low/Support), 36.67 (Previous Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close above $39.00 with continued demand.
- **Invalidation:** $33.85 (Below the stopping volume low)
---
### OKLO (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Absorption/Weakness Follow-Through

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly context is BEARISH. The monthly sequence is a confirmed early BUYING_CLIMAX (January bar high volume, wide spread up, CLV -0.28). Weekly data confirms strong volatility. The 2026-01-05 bar was a large Buying Climax (volume 1.18, high close), followed by immediate weakness. The last two weeks (2026-01-12 and 2026-01-19) show high volume on wide spreads down, with deep negative CLVs (-0.38 and -0.77). This confirms distribution and weakness following the buying climax. The price is failing to hold the high ground despite heavy volume.

**Key Levels:** 115.72 (Buying Climax Peak), 90.83 (Previous Weekly Open), 86.01 (Recent Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 86.01 on sustained volume.
- **Invalidation:** 100.20 (Last weekly high)
---
### OZK (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax/Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but weekly is SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The last weekly bar (2026-01-19) is a massive wide spread down bar on Very High Relative Volume (2.37). The CLV is extremely negative (-0.91), signaling a severe Selling Climax event or a climactic effort by Smart Money to offload positions. Given the immediate confirmation via Algo Detection, this supply is dominant. Price attempted to move up (open 47.75 to high 49.68) but was aggressively sold down, suggesting strong distribution.

**Key Levels:** 49.69 (Supply/Distribution Peak), 45.77 (Climax Low/Immediate Support), 48.47 (Prior Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 45.77 on follow-through selling.
- **Invalidation:** 48.47 (Above prior week's high close)
---
### PTGX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax Test Failure

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BEARISH. Monthly sequence is BUYING_CLIMAX (WATCH_FOR_TEST). After a minor rally in late December, the 2026-01-05 bar was a wide spread down (8.34 spread) on high volume (1.02), closing near the low (CLV -0.75), confirming weakness. The last two weeks (01-12, 01-19) attempted rallies but failed to maintain high closes (CLV -0.25, 0.14), indicating supply overcoming demand. The rally attempt last week failed near the $85.50 level. The low CLV on the monthly bar (-0.07) also indicates persistent supply in January.

**Key Levels:** 87.53 (Prior Resistance), 85.50 (Recent Failed High), 79.87 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 79.87 on high volume.
- **Invalidation:** 85.50 (Recent weekly high)
---
### QQQI (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax Test/Sustained Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BULLISH. Monthly is BUYING_CLIMAX (WATCH_FOR_TEST), but the CLV (0.05) is neutral, and the spread (2.06) is not extreme, suggesting the climactic move was absorbed. Weekly analysis shows high relative volume (1.22, 1.32) in the last two weeks, with the latest bar (2026-01-19) showing a wide spread up and a high close (CLV 0.73). Despite high volume suggesting potential profit-taking (Climax), the dominant behavior is sustained upward pressure, closing strongly near the high of the range. The market is absorbing supply effectively.

**Key Levels:** 54.19 (Recent High/Resistance), 52.78 (Critical Support), 53.59 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 54.19 on strong volume.
- **Invalidation:** 52.78 (Low of the selling wave)
---
### QTWO (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply/Reversal

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BEARISH, but signs of a bottom forming. Monthly sequence is SUPPLY_DOMINANCE, but the last bar has a neutral CLV (0.11), suggesting the month ended better than it started. Weekly analysis shows two clear downside shakes: 2026-01-05 and 2026-01-12, both showing weakness (negative CLV, high spread). However, the last bar (2026-01-19) is a reversal: wide spread up bar, closing near the high (CLV 0.95), on high volume (0.72). This signals significant demand entering at the lows ($63.43) and absorbing supply. This is a potential Spring/Reversal sign.

**Key Levels:** 72.49 (Major Resistance), 68.59 (Immediate Resistance), 63.44 (Spring Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 68.59 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** 63.44 (Low of reversal bar)
---
### RF (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Weakness/Supply Follow-Through

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the monthly sequence is SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The weekly sequence shows strong selling pressure emerging. The 2026-01-05 bar attempted an upward move on high volume (0.75) but closed mid-range (CLV 0.16), suggesting supply absorption. The last two bars (01-12, 01-19) are wide spread down bars on high volume (0.87, 0.79) closing near their lows (CLV -0.32, -0.73). This is undeniable evidence of supply returning to the market, pushing the price down aggressively, threatening the bullish quarterly trend.

**Key Levels:** 28.99 (Resistance/Supply), 27.25 (Immediate Support), 27.77 (Prior Close Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 27.25 on high volume.
- **Invalidation:** 28.61 (High of last swing)
---
### RGLD (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Extreme Bullish Effort

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BULLISH. Monthly sequence is SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (WATCH_FOR_TEST), but the monthly bar closed extremely high (CLV 0.97) on average volume (1.14), suggesting that any supply was overwhelmed. Weekly analysis confirms extreme bullish momentum. The last two weeks (01-12, 01-19) are wide spread up bars on high CLV (0.96, 0.93) with consistent volume (around 0.90), indicating relentless Effort to Rise and Success. The current move is a powerful Sign of Strength (SOS).

**Key Levels:** 293.99 (Recent High/Resistance), 274.89 (Immediate Support), 265.48 (Prior High Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Buy on minor pullback or break above 294.00.
- **Invalidation:** 265.70 (Low of the last strong move)
---
### RGTI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Weakness Follow-Through/Selling Pressure

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BEARISH. Monthly sequence is BUYING_CLIMAX (CONFIRMED_EARLY). High volatility confirms confusion. The 2026-01-05 bar was a wide spread up bar closing negatively (CLV -0.25) on high volume (0.52), indicating supply absorption/Effort No Result. The last bar (2026-01-19) is a wide spread down bar on high volume (0.59), closing mid-range/low (CLV -0.49). This confirms the short-term supply is controlling the market, overriding the attempt to push higher earlier in the month. The monthly CLV (-0.27) supports the downside pressure.

**Key Levels:** 26.70 (Supply Zone), 22.41 (Immediate Support), 23.76 (Prior Swing Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 22.41 on high volume.
- **Invalidation:** 26.50 (High of the last testing bar)
---
### RKT (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Return/Effort No Result Down

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the recent monthly data shows SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (WATCH_FOR_TEST). Weekly 2026-01-05 was a strong SOS (volume 1.30, CLV 0.92). However, this momentum immediately failed. The last two weeks are bearish: 2026-01-12 shows a wide spread down, closing low (CLV -0.15) on high volume (1.01), suggesting selling pressure. The 2026-01-19 bar confirms this, a wide spread down on high volume (0.77), closing deep in the range (CLV -0.49). This suggests the bullish SOS was met by strong supply/distribution, confirming the monthly trend shift.

**Key Levels:** 24.36 (Supply Peak), 22.42 (Support Break), 20.53 (Critical Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 20.53 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** 22.67 (High of last supply bar)
---
### RTO (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort to Rise and Success

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BULLISH. Weekly sequence is STOPPING_VOLUME (WATCH_FOR_TEST), suggesting prior supply was absorbed. The 2026-01-12 bar was high volume (1.91) wide spread up, closing middle (CLV 0.16), suggesting supply absorption. The last bar (2026-01-19) confirms the strength: very wide spread up (2.37) on Very High Relative Volume (2.89), closing near the high (CLV 0.83). This is definitive Effort to Rise and Success, breaking prior resistance, signaling strong Smart Money commitment.

**Key Levels:** 33.13 (Recent High/Target), 31.54 (Prior Resistance/New Support), 30.76 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Buy on confirmation above 33.13 or on a minor pullback to 31.54.
- **Invalidation:** 30.76 (Low of the last strong move)
---
### SA (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort to Rise and Success (Climactic)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BULLISH. Monthly sequence is SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The last weekly bar (2026-01-19) is extremely bullish: wide spread up bar (6.24 spread) on Very High Volume (1.23), closing high (CLV 0.48). This represents a successful Effort to Rise, breaking several weeks of resistance. While the volume is climactic, the positive close suggests the demand is overpowering the supply in this instant, leading to a strong move up in line with the quarterly trend.

**Key Levels:** 37.99 (Recent High/Target), 32.29 (Immediate Support), 31.75 (Prior Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Buy on minor pullback or break above 38.00.
- **Invalidation:** 31.75 (Low of the thrust bar)
---
### STAA (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance/Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BEARISH. Weekly sequence is STOPPING_VOLUME (WATCH_FOR_TEST), but the attempt failed. The 2026-01-05 bar had extremely high volume (2.72) but closed near the open (CLV 0.03), suggesting supply absorbed demand. The last two bars (01-12, 01-19) confirm weakness. The last bar is a wide spread down on high volume (1.15), closing at the absolute low (CLV -0.92). This is a strong sign of weakness, confirming that the attempted Stopping Volume failed and supply is pushing the price lower in line with the quarterly downtrend.

**Key Levels:** 21.27 (Immediate Resistance), 19.06 (Recent Low/Support), 20.50 (Prior Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 19.06 on strong volume.
- **Invalidation:** 21.27 (High of the supply bar)
---
### TFX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance/Weakness

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BEARISH. Weekly sequence is SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The last two weeks confirm aggressive supply. 2026-01-12 was a wide spread down bar on Very High Volume (1.61) with an extreme negative CLV (-0.93), showing strong selling pressure. The last bar (2026-01-19) is another wide spread down on high volume (1.29), closing mid-low (CLV -0.06), indicating persistent selling pressure, despite a slightly better close than the prior week. The monthly CLV (-0.76) confirms the bearish control in January.

**Key Levels:** 107.06 (Immediate Resistance), 100.18 (Critical Support), 103.00 (Prior Close Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 100.18 on high volume.
- **Invalidation:** 107.06 (High of the last supply bar)
---
### TRU (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance/Weakness

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BEARISH. Monthly sequence is STOPPING_VOLUME (CONFIRMED_STRONG), suggesting accumulation/reversal attempt in prior months. However, the last weekly bar (2026-01-19) is a wide spread down on above average volume (0.66), closing low (CLV -0.04). While not extreme selling, this represents immediate follow-through weakness after the 2026-01-05 rally failed to sustain (Effort to Rise, CLV 0.64). The failure to hold $86-$87 confirms that overhead supply remains dominant, overriding the monthly stopping volume signal for now.

**Key Levels:** 86.36 (Immediate Resistance), 81.71 (Critical Support), 83.18 (Prior Swing Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 81.71 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** 86.36 (High of the last swing)
---
### USIG (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply (Minor Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BULLISH. Weekly sequence is SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (WATCH_FOR_TEST), but the volume action contradicts this. Despite high volume (2.36) on 2026-01-12, the spread was narrow and the close was mid-range, suggesting supply was absorbed quickly. The last bar (2026-01-19) shows low spread on slightly elevated volume (1.11), closing near the high (CLV 0.94). This indicates demand is still active, and the market is testing the recent low ($51.65) without finding significant supply (No Supply test success). Bullish continuation is likely.

**Key Levels:** 52.12 (Recent High/Target), 51.81 (Immediate Support), 51.65 (Test Low/Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 52.01 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** 51.65 (Low of the last test)
---
### VONG (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply/Demand Return

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BEARISH, but the monthly sequence shows STOPPING_VOLUME (WATCH_FOR_TEST). Weekly analysis shows volatility in early January (wide spread, high volume). The 2026-01-12 bar was very high volume (2.51) wide spread down, but the CLV was only -0.32, suggesting absorption. The last bar (2026-01-19) is a wide spread up bar on high volume (1.34), closing very high (CLV 0.70). This strong upward thrust from the lows ($117.62) indicates aggressive demand returning, likely confirming the monthly Stopping Volume signal. This is a potential Spring action.

**Key Levels:** 123.18 (Immediate Resistance), 117.63 (Spring Low/Support), 120.94 (Prior Swing High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 123.18 on strong volume.
- **Invalidation:** 117.63 (Low of the reversal bar)
---
## 👀 Watch/Monitoring
### ABT (BEARISH (Short-Term Exhaustion))
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax / Extreme Volume Down-Bar

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar shows an extremely wide spread down, closing near the low, on unprecedented volume (RelVol 3.14). This is a potential selling climax, indicating a huge transfer of stock from weak hands to Smart Money, but the immediate bearish action is overwhelming. Monthly context is also very bearish (wide spread down, low CLV, high volume). While this suggests a low might be near, the confirmation of Stopping Volume or a Test is required before considering a long position. Currently, supply is dominant.

**Key Levels:** 105.78 (Potential Low/Support), 121.37 (Previous Support/Resistance), 128.80 (Recent High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Look for a subsequent low volume Test (No Supply) of the 105.78 area, or a clear reversal pattern on lower timeframes.
- **Invalidation:** A close below 105.77 (low of the climax bar) would indicate continuation of markdown.
---
### ACLX (NEUTRAL-TO-BEARISH (Caution))
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Down Bar

**Smart Money Logic:**
ACLX is in a Quarterly BULLISH_TREND but the Monthly Sequence is SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The last weekly bar was an aggressive move down from the high (CLV -0.67) on high volume (RelVol 1.70). This indicates strong selling/profit-taking right at a critical resistance zone (76.50 high). The failure to close strong suggests Smart Money is distributing here. Needs a clear Test or absorption before resuming the bullish trend.

**Key Levels:** 76.50 (Supply/Resistance), 66.00 (Recent Low Support), 60.35 (Key Monthly Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a low volume up-bar or a successful Test of the 66.00-68.00 zone.
- **Invalidation:** A strong weekly close above 76.50 (Absorption confirmed) or a breakdown below 66.00 (Distribution confirmed).
---
### ACN (NEUTRAL-TO-BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Up Bar on Average Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
ACN is in a strong Quarterly BULLISH_TREND. The Monthly sequence is STOPPING_VOLUME (watching for test of the prior move down). The last weekly bar is an up bar (closing slightly higher than open, CLV 0.05) on average volume (RelVol 0.87). This suggests recent supply from the prior week (Jan 12 wide down spread) is being absorbed quietly. The high volume prior weeks suggest Smart Money support is present (Stopping Volume). Consolidation near the highs is constructive.

**Key Levels:** 291.09 (Resistance/All-time High area), 272.22 (Immediate Support/Demand line), 258.00 (Monthly Stopping Volume Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry on a breakout above 291.09, or a clean low volume pull-back (Test) towards 272.22.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 270.00.
---
### AGIO (NEUTRAL-TO-BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Up Bar on Average Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is Bearish, but the Monthly sequence is STOPPING_VOLUME, indicating potential reversal interest. The last weekly bar is a strong up-bar, closing near the high (CLV 0.60) on average volume (RelVol 0.79). This action is constructive, suggesting demand is emerging and absorbing earlier selling (Dec 22 high volume climax/shakeout). We are looking for accumulation confirmation.

**Key Levels:** 29.44 (Immediate Resistance), 26.25 (Test Low/Support), 24.15 (Climax Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Sustained move above 29.44 on high volume, or a low volume Test (No Supply) pullback towards 27.00.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 26.25.
---
### AIQ (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort to Rise / Strong Close

**Smart Money Logic:**
AIQ is in a Quarterly BULLISH_TREND, and despite the Monthly STOPPING_VOLUME warning, recent weekly action is positive. The last bar is a strong up bar, closing very near the high (CLV 0.80) on average volume (RelVol 0.97). This suggests strong demand is absorbing the supply encountered in the prior two weeks (Jan 5/12 stopping action). The action confirms Smart Money is likely marking prices up.

**Key Levels:** 53.25 (Resistance), 50.87 (Immediate Support/Demand), 52.00 (Recent Consolidation Area)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry on volume increase and clear breakout above 53.25.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 50.87.
---
### AL (NEUTRAL (Extreme Narrow Trading Range))
**VSA Status:** Up Bar / Extremely Low Volatility

**Smart Money Logic:**
This ticker is locked in an extremely narrow, low-volume trading range. Quarterly Trend is BULLISH, but the Monthly is flagged as BUYING_CLIMAX. The VSA signals are ambiguous due to the tiny spread and volume. The last bar closed high (CLV 0.47) but the spread is negligible. This pattern suggests institutional commitment at 64.00-64.50, but lack of liquidity or volatility means no immediate trade is viable. Could be pending news or massive passive institutional buying/selling.

**Key Levels:** 64.47 (Resistance/Recent High), 64.10 (Immediate Support), 63.64 (Monthly Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a high volume breakout (either direction) from the 64.10 - 64.47 range.
- **Invalidation:** N/A (Pending clarity from range expansion).
---
### ALL (NEUTRAL (Volatile Accumulation Attempt))
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax / Down Bar Recovery

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly Trend is BEARISH, Weekly is SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The Jan 12 bar was a massive wide spread down, closing near the low on very high volume (RelVol 2.04), indicating a potential Selling Climax. The subsequent bar (Jan 19) is a smaller spread up-bar, closing marginally higher (CLV 0.016) on decreased volume (RelVol 1.09). This reduced volume and small spread suggests professional absorption/accumulation following the panic selling. We need a clear low-volume Test to confirm accumulation.

**Key Levels:** 215.00 (Recent Resistance), 191.13 (Climax Low Support), 196.09 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Low volume Test (No Supply) near 191.13 or 192.00. Wait for clear demand signal.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 190.00.
---
### AMZU (BULLISH (Short-Term))
**VSA Status:** Up Bar / High Close

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly Trend is BEARISH, but the Jan 5 bar was an aggressive move up on high volume (RelVol 1.08), suggesting a potential pivot or rally. Although the Jan 12 bar was a down bar, the last bar (Jan 19) is a wide spread up bar closing very high (CLV 0.80) on strong volume (RelVol 0.90). This confirms demand is present and likely absorbing the supply from the prior two weeks. This is a strong rebound from the 33.08 support area.

**Key Levels:** 40.40 (Resistance/Recent High), 37.04 (Immediate Support), 33.08 (Key Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry on a break above 37.50, aiming for 40.40.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 35.00.
---
### ARWR (NEUTRAL-TO-BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Up Bar / Failure to Close Strong

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly Trend is BULLISH, but Weekly is CONFIRMED_EARLY SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The Jan 5 bar saw high volume supply/climax selling (RelVol 2.19). The last bar (Jan 19) is an up bar on average volume (RelVol 0.76) but closing near the middle (CLV 0.13), indicating limited ability to follow through on the upside. Price is consolidating below the recent high of 71.16, but the low CLV suggests a struggle against remaining supply after the Jan 5 markdown.

**Key Levels:** 71.16 (Resistance), 61.65 (Recent Support), 60.61 (Climax Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a clear break of 71.16 on high volume (bullish) or a break below 61.65 (bearish continuation).
- **Invalidation:** Close above 71.50 or below 61.00.
---
### AXTA (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Up Bar / Weak Close

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly Trend is BULLISH, Monthly is STOPPING_VOLUME. The recent weekly bars have been consistently strong and tight (Jan 12 was a strong up bar). The latest bar (Jan 19) is an up bar on decreased volume (RelVol 0.72) but failed to close strong (CLV 0.19), suggesting some mild supply emerged near the high (34.20). This looks like minor profit-taking within a strong accumulation range, needing a Test of the lows to confirm commitment.

**Key Levels:** 34.20 (Resistance/High), 32.76 (Immediate Support), 31.61 (Stopping Volume Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Breakout above 34.20 or a low volume Test towards 33.00.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 32.76.
---
### BABX (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Up Bar / Failure to Close Strong

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly Trend is BEARISH, Monthly is SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. After a volatile swing up (Jan 12 wide spread up on high volume), the last bar (Jan 19) shows mixed results. It's an up bar but closed only in the upper quartile (CLV 0.15) on decreased volume (RelVol 0.95). The high wick suggests supply emerging between 49 and 53, preventing a strong close. This indicates absorption is occurring, but supply is still significant at the high end of the recent range (41-53).

**Key Levels:** 53.35 (Resistance/High), 42.82 (Immediate Support), 41.00 (Prior Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for confirmation of supply absorption (low volume test) or failure to hold 42.82.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 53.35 (Bullish) or below 42.00 (Bearish).

### BANC (NEUTRAL (Volatile Accumulation))
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax / Extreme Down Bar

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly Trend is BULLISH, but Monthly is CONFIRMED_STRONG BUYING_CLIMAX (distribution is underway). The Jan 12 bar was a final thrust up on high volume. The last bar (Jan 19) is a wide spread down, closing near the absolute low (CLV -0.95) on increased volume (RelVol 1.10). This confirms the end of the rally and intense selling, possibly a final shakeout / selling climax within a longer accumulation range, but highly bearish in the short term. The volume and CLV suggest Smart Money is participating in the liquidation, potentially buying below 20.00.

**Key Levels:** 21.61 (Climax High), 19.88 (Immediate Support), 19.11 (Key Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a successful low volume Test of the 19.11 area.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 19.11 (confirming markdown).
---
### BBIO (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Test of Supply / Up Bar

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly Trend is BULLISH, Weekly is STOPPING_VOLUME (watching for test). The prior high volume selling (Jan 12, RelVol 2.03) established a strong demand zone at 70.94. The latest bar (Jan 19) is an up bar on decreased volume (RelVol 1.06), closing near the open/middle (CLV 0.08). While the CLV is neutral, the bar itself suggests absorption of supply after the strong shakeout, and the volume suggests demand is overcoming the supply pressure from the prior week's high volume down move.

**Key Levels:** 81.32 (Resistance), 73.77 (Immediate Support), 70.94 (Stopping Volume Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry on a breakout above 78.50, or a low volume pullback to 74.00.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 73.77.
---
### BBT (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Up Bar / Failure to Close Strong

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly Trend is BULLISH, Monthly is BUYING_CLIMAX. The last bar is a wide spread up on moderate volume (RelVol 0.87), but the close is near the middle/low (CLV -0.04). This is an Effort No Result Up, suggesting supply is actively selling into this upward move (likely distribution/climax action). The high of 29.62 represents clear resistance where Smart Money is likely liquidating positions.

**Key Levels:** 29.63 (Resistance/Supply), 27.00 (Immediate Support/Open), 25.93 (Swing Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on failure to break 29.63 and subsequent weakness below 27.00.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 29.70.
---
### BBWI (NEUTRAL-TO-BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Down Bar

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly Trend is BULLISH, but Monthly is CONFIRMED_EARLY SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (distribution phase). The previous four weeks were characterized by strong demand. The last bar (Jan 19) reverses this trend, showing a wide spread down, closing near the low (CLV -0.13) on below-average volume (RelVol 0.53). While volume is low, the price action suggests supply is now starting to gain control, confirming the monthly distribution phase.

**Key Levels:** 23.73 (Resistance/High), 21.58 (Immediate Support/Demand), 20.39 (Prior Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and sustained close below 21.58 (Bearish). Reversal on low volume test of 21.58 (Bullish).
- **Invalidation:** A strong close above 23.73.
---
### BEP (NEUTRAL-TO-BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Up Bar / Weak Close

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly Trend is BEARISH, Monthly is CONFIRMED_EARLY SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The last bar is an up bar on low volume (RelVol 0.69), failing to close strong (CLV 0.16). This signals a weak rally effort (Effort No Result Up), likely running into the confirmed supply overhead. The rally failed to recoup much ground from the prior high volume down move (Jan 5).

**Key Levels:** 28.97 (Resistance), 27.48 (Immediate Support), 26.71 (Monthly Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on failure to break 28.97 and subsequent weakness below 27.50.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 29.00.
---
### BHF (BEARISH (Weakness Continues))
**VSA Status:** Down Bar / Low Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly Trend is BEARISH, Monthly is BUYING_CLIMAX (potential distribution). The price action remains weak, consolidating at low volume (RelVol 0.49). The last bar is a narrow spread down, closing near the low (CLV -0.44). In the context of a potential distribution phase (Monthly Climax), this low volume selling suggests supply is still present and absorption efforts are failing. Lack of demand is the key concern.

**Key Levels:** 64.50 (Immediate Resistance), 63.96 (Immediate Support), 63.79 (Swing Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below 63.79.
- **Invalidation:** Sustained rally above 65.00.
---
### BKSY (NEUTRAL-TO-BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Up Bar / Failure to Close Strong

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly Trend is BULLISH, Monthly is BUYING_CLIMAX (potential distribution). The last bar is a wide spread up on average volume (RelVol 0.88), but the close is near the middle/low (CLV 0.14). This suggests an 'Effort No Result Up' pattern, indicating strong supply is meeting the bullish efforts near the highs (29.46). This action reinforces the monthly distribution warning.

**Key Levels:** 29.47 (Resistance/Supply), 27.08 (Immediate Close), 23.90 (Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Failure to break 29.47 followed by a close below 25.00.
- **Invalidation:** Decisive high volume close above 29.47.
---
### BRBR (BULLISH (Potential Reversal))
**VSA Status:** Up Bar / Strong Close

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly Trend is BEARISH, Monthly is SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The prior weeks saw heavy markdown confirmed by high volume. However, the last bar (Jan 19) is a wide spread up, closing strongly in the upper quartile (CLV 0.66) on average volume (RelVol 1.17). This indicates significant demand re-emerging, challenging the prevailing bearish trend. The price recovered almost all the ground lost in the preceding down bar, suggesting accumulation or a temporary reversal of supply dominance.

**Key Levels:** 28.26 (Immediate Resistance), 24.65 (Immediate Support/Demand), 21.67 (Climax Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry on a decisive move above 28.30 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 24.65.
---
### BRKR (NEUTRAL (Potential Reversal))
**VSA Status:** Up Bar / Failure to Close Strong

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly Trend is BULLISH, Monthly is STOPPING_VOLUME. After the Jan 12 high volume wide spread down (RelVol 1.06), which looked like a shakeout (CLV -0.86), the last bar attempts recovery. It is a wide spread up on decreased volume (RelVol 0.86), closing near the middle (CLV 0.05). This suggests demand is present (from the low 46.81) but supply is aggressive at higher prices, preventing a strong close. Neutral action indicating a battle between demand (at the lows) and supply (at the highs).

**Key Levels:** 54.57 (Resistance/High), 47.84 (Immediate Support), 46.82 (Shakeout Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Clear break above 53.50 or low volume test of 47.50.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 46.82.
---
### BRZE (NEUTRAL-TO-BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Up Bar / Weak Close

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly Trend is BEARISH, Monthly is CONFIRMED_EARLY BUYING_CLIMAX (distribution confirmed). After the massive markdown on Jan 12 (RelVol 1.55, CLV -0.95), the last bar (Jan 19) is a wide spread up, closing near the middle (CLV 0.40) on high volume (RelVol 1.36). This high volume up bar that doesn't close strong suggests a strong selling pressure absorbing the rally. This is typical supply action following a distribution phase. Smart Money is still focused on markdown.

**Key Levels:** 26.16 (Resistance), 22.65 (Demand/Low), 34.52 (Distribution High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry if price fails to hold above 25.00, targeting 22.65.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 28.00.
---
### BSY (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Up Bar / Failure to Close Strong

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly Trend is BEARISH, Monthly is SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The last bar is a wide spread up on average volume (RelVol 0.96), but the close is near the middle (CLV 0.17). This indicates the rally encountered significant supply near 39.73, suggesting an Effort No Result Up, preventing a strong markup. The price is currently consolidating within the recent range, showing indecision.

**Key Levels:** 40.66 (Resistance), 38.64 (Immediate Support/Open), 37.55 (Swing Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Breakout above 40.66 (Bullish) or breakdown below 37.55 (Bearish).
- **Invalidation:** N/A (Pending range resolution).
---
### BWIN (NEUTRAL-TO-BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Down Bar / Weak Close

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly Trend is BEARISH, Monthly is SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The last bar is a down bar on high volume (RelVol 1.11), closing near the low (CLV -0.75). This is strong confirmation of supply overriding demand, especially after the strong up-bar attempt the prior week (Jan 12). This reinforces the bearish monthly context, indicating Smart Money is continuing to push prices lower.

**Key Levels:** 26.81 (Resistance), 24.89 (Immediate Support), 23.35 (Monthly Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on break below 24.89.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 26.50.
---
### BXSL (NEUTRAL-TO-BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Down Bar / Weak Close

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly Trend is BEARISH, Monthly is SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The last bar is a down bar on high volume (RelVol 1.02), closing near the low (CLV -0.59). This confirms the continuation of the bearish phase after the market failed to sustain the Jan 12 up move (CLV 0.74). The repeated high-volume selling and inability to hold gains indicates sustained institutional liquidation.

**Key Levels:** 26.94 (Resistance), 25.90 (Immediate Support), 25.42 (Swing Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on a close below 25.90.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 26.50.
---
### CALM (BULLISH (Potential Reversal))
**VSA Status:** Up Bar / Strong Close

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly Trend is BEARISH, Weekly is SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The prior three weeks showed aggressive selling climax action (Jan 5 high volume down bar). The last bar (Jan 19) is a strong wide spread up bar, closing in the upper half (CLV 0.35) on high volume (RelVol 1.40). This suggests demand is returning and absorbing the supply from the recent markdown phase, potentially signaling a secondary test in the accumulation process. The volume increase with a strong close indicates Smart Money interest.

**Key Levels:** 82.80 (Resistance), 75.72 (Immediate Support), 71.92 (Climax Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry on continuation above 80.50, or a successful low volume Test of 77.00.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 75.72.
---
### CBSH (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar shows High Volume (RelVol 1.32) on a Wide Spread UP bar, but the closing price is in the lower portion (CLV -0.84), indicating significant Selling Pressure (Effort No Result Up). This occurred after two prior high volume up bars, suggesting Smart Money is distributing into the strength. The overall Monthly context is SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (WATCH_FOR_TEST), which aligns with this weekly weakness.

**Key Levels:** 56.06 (Weekly High/Resistance), 53.00 (Psychological/Recent Low Close), 51.47 (Recent Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $53.00 on increasing bearish volume.
- **Invalidation:** $56.06 (Above previous bar high)
---
### CCOI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly sequence is confirmed as a BUYING_CLIMAX. The last weekly bar closed mid-range (CLV 0.32) on slightly below average volume (RelVol 0.45), following a very large spread bar three weeks prior. This lack of follow-through after major expansion, coupled with the previous spike in volume/price (Monthly Buying Climax), suggests demand is waning and Smart Money is liquidating positions. Low relative volume on the recent up move is a sign of weakness.

**Key Levels:** 25.05 (Recent High/Supply), 22.79 (Recent Support), 20.50 (Swing Low Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $23.00 with increased selling volume.
- **Invalidation:** $25.05 (Above high of the peak week)
---
### CPNG (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
The price remains in a clear bearish structure (Quarterly BEARISH_TREND, Weekly/Monthly SUPPLY_DOMINANCE). The last weekly bar was a down bar closing low (CLV -0.58) on High Volume (RelVol 1.47). This confirms persistent supply pressure. The prior weeks showed consistent high volume downward movement, confirming the continuing distribution and weakness.

**Key Levels:** 21.14 (Immediate Resistance), 19.69 (Recent Low/Support), 23.70 (Overhead Supply)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $19.69 on high volume.
- **Invalidation:** $21.14 (Above immediate pivot resistance)
---
### CRBG (NEUTRAL/BEARISH WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly status is BUYING_CLIMAX (CONFIRMED_EARLY). The last weekly bar closed mid-range (CLV 0.04) on slightly reduced volume (RelVol 0.80). This suggests the heavy accumulation/buying effort seen previously is slowing, leaving the price drifting. Given the Quarterly BEARISH_TREND, the previous buying strength might have been a relief rally that failed to break out. The narrow spread and mid-close indicates indecision under major resistance.

**Key Levels:** 31.50 (Resistance), 29.35 (Immediate Support), 30.70 (Recent High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $29.80 (Recent low pivot) on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** $31.50 (Above high of recent range)
---
### CSGP (BULLISH WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Test of Supply / Demand Return

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly and Weekly trend is bearish (SUPPLY_DOMINANCE). However, the price experienced a huge shakeout three weeks ago (RelVol 2.05, CLV -0.98), followed immediately by a Stopping Volume bar the next week (RelVol 2.16, CLV 0.867). The last week was an UP bar, closing high (CLV 0.12) on high volume (RelVol 1.40). The high volume suggests continued demand absorbing supply near the pivot. While structurally bearish, short-term demand is strong after a major spring/shakeout.

**Key Levels:** 67.90 (Overhead Supply), 62.81 (Immediate Support), 57.01 (Stopping Volume Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $66.00 with sustained volume, targeting $68.
- **Invalidation:** $62.81 (Below recent swing low)
---
### CTRA (NEUTRAL/BEARISH WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Effort No Result

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Weekly status is BUYING_CLIMAX (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The large volume spike two weeks ago (RelVol 2.07) failed to sustain the rally, resulting in a down bar closing low (CLV -0.457). The last week was an UP bar, closing high (CLV 0.57) on average volume (RelVol 0.93). This rebound is weak compared to the previous selling volume, suggesting difficulty in pushing higher. The structure suggests Smart Money is distributing near the highs ($28.50).

**Key Levels:** 28.48 (Resistance), 26.00 (Immediate Support), 24.82 (Swing Low Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $26.00 confirming distribution, or a failed test of $28.00.
- **Invalidation:** $28.48 (Above high of buying climax)
---
### DOW (NEUTRAL/BEARISH WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last two weekly bars show large spread up moves on high volume (RelVol 1.02, 0.86), but the recent bar closed lower than the prior week, and the closing CLV (0.39) is not dominant. This suggests increasing resistance as the price approaches the high, hinting at 'Effort No Result' in pushing decisively higher. The Monthly context is SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (WATCH_FOR_TEST), which supports the idea of hidden selling at these levels.

**Key Levels:** 29.09 (Recent High/Supply), 27.57 (Immediate Support), 26.07 (Prior Pivot Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $27.57 on rising selling volume.
- **Invalidation:** $29.09 (Above current supply level)
---
### DUOL (BULLISH WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax / Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
This ticker is in a strong Quarterly BEARISH_TREND, but the action in the last two weeks is constructive for bears taking profits/Smart Money accumulation. Two weeks ago saw extreme spread down on high volume (RelVol 1.60, CLV -0.78), a potential Selling Climax. The last week was an Up bar with high volume (RelVol 1.18) closing mid-range (CLV 0.44), suggesting strong demand absorption after the climax. This looks like Stopping Volume building a base.

**Key Levels:** 170.09 (Immediate Resistance), 142.10 (Stopping Volume Low/Support), 150.16 (Recent Close Pivot)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Low volume test down towards $148, or a break above $161.28.
- **Invalidation:** $142.10 (Below the low of the stopping volume bar)
---
### FER (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Test of Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar was an UP bar with a high close (CLV 0.28) on high volume (RelVol 0.96). This indicates underlying demand, but the high volume suggests that supply is still present (Test of Supply). The price is consolidating slightly below the recent high ($68.54). The Monthly SUPPLY_DOMINANCE suggests caution, but short-term demand is active.

**Key Levels:** 68.54 (Resistance), 66.61 (Immediate Support), 65.55 (Swing Low Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close above $68.54 with follow-through volume, confirming supply absorption.
- **Invalidation:** $65.55 (Below recent demand area)
---
### FIBK (NEUTRAL/BEARISH WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result / Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly status is BUYING_CLIMAX (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The last weekly bar was a large UP spread on high volume (RelVol 0.86) but closed in the middle/lower portion (CLV -0.49). This is a clear Effort No Result, suggesting selling pressure absorbed the demand near the highs ($38.78). This confirms the Monthly Buying Climax theme, suggesting distribution.

**Key Levels:** 38.78 (Recent High/Supply), 35.95 (Immediate Support), 34.30 (Major Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $35.95 with elevated selling volume.
- **Invalidation:** $38.78 (Above the supply rejection high)
---
### FTAI (NEUTRAL/BEARISH WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Weekly status is BUYING_CLIMAX (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The last three bars show massive spread expansion and high volume (RelVol 1.35, 2.39, 1.43, 2.03), suggesting aggressive buying. However, the last bar was the largest spread, yet the CLV (0.22) is low compared to the prior two strong closes (0.67 and 0.81). This indicates that despite the huge effort to push to $310, Smart Money is meeting resistance and possibly distributing. The lack of an extreme high close on the widest bar is the first sign of climax action.

**Key Levels:** 310.00 (Peak/Supply), 273.71 (Immediate Support), 264.01 (Swing Low Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $270.00 on rising selling volume.
- **Invalidation:** $310.00 (Above the climax peak)
---
### GNTX (NEUTRAL/BEARISH WATCH)
**VSA Status:** No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly context is SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The last weekly bar was a Narrow Spread UP bar, closing low (CLV -0.35) on High Volume (RelVol 1.02). This indicates an inability to sustain the rally despite effort, suggesting active supply. The previous week also closed low (CLV -0.01) on high volume (RelVol 1.21), confirming the difficulty in upward movement. This is a setup for a potential reversal into the supply dominance theme.

**Key Levels:** 24.11 (Resistance), 23.34 (Immediate Support), 23.93 (Previous Low Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $23.34 with increased selling volume.
- **Invalidation:** $24.11 (Above immediate resistance)
---
### GWRE (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly and Weekly trends are BEARISH (SUPPLY_DOMINANCE). The last bar was a DOWN bar closing high (CLV 0.74) on extremely high volume (RelVol 1.88). While the high CLV suggests demand absorption, the volume is massive, and it failed to overcome the prior week's decisive down move (CLV -0.98). Overall context dictates strong supply. The high volume likely represents a consolidation of the strong selling pressure from the previous bars, allowing Smart Money to exit/reposition.

**Key Levels:** 160.85 (Immediate Resistance), 154.51 (New Low/Support), 185.07 (Previous Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $154.51 on follow-through volume.
- **Invalidation:** $160.85 (Above the recent high)
---
### HPE (BULLISH WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH, but the recent action suggests accumulation. Two weeks ago saw low CLV (CLV -0.96) on high volume (RelVol 0.51), confirming weakness near the low. However, the last bar was a narrow spread UP bar, closing mid-range (CLV 0.04) on higher volume (RelVol 0.59). The volume is increasing on the rally off the low, and the price structure is tightening, suggesting demand is stabilizing the price after the recent climax sell-off.

**Key Levels:** 21.93 (Immediate Resistance), 20.08 (Stopping Volume Low/Support), 21.44 (Previous Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $21.93 on sustained volume.
- **Invalidation:** $20.07 (Below the stopping volume low)
---
### HRMY (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Test of Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly status is SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The last bar was an UP bar (Spread 2.24) closing mid-range (CLV 0.47) on low volume (RelVol 0.66). The volume suggests a potential successful test of supply after the prior week's wide down bar (CLV -0.34) on high volume. The low relative volume on the current demand bar suggests reduced supply pressure, which is constructive if followed by strength.

**Key Levels:** 37.41 (Immediate Resistance), 35.16 (Support), 39.40 (Overhead Supply)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $37.41 with increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** $35.16 (Below recent low)
---
### INVH (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Test of Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Weekly status is STOPPING_VOLUME (WATCH_FOR_TEST). Two weeks ago showed strong demand (RelVol 1.26, CLV 0.98), but the last bar was a narrow spread, down close (CLV -0.40) on lower volume (RelVol 0.87). This suggests a moderate Test of Supply after the strong previous up move. While the price closed lower, the lack of significant spread expansion or ultra-high volume indicates that the supply encountered was manageable. Consolidation is needed.

**Key Levels:** 27.78 (Immediate Resistance), 26.94 (Support), 25.98 (Swing Low Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close above $27.78 on volume, signaling continuation.
- **Invalidation:** $26.94 (Below immediate pivot)
---
### ITT (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Test of Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly context is SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The last weekly bar was an UP bar with a high spread, but closed mid-range (CLV 0.017) on average volume (RelVol 0.93). This suggests supply is still present near the highs ($187.65), creating resistance. The inability to close strong despite the rally attempt suggests testing of overhead supply is ongoing and no clear breakout is confirmed yet.

**Key Levels:** 187.65 (Resistance), 180.48 (Immediate Support), 178.49 (Swing Low Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close above $187.65 with high volume.
- **Invalidation:** $180.48 (Below recent open)
---
### KDP (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Test of Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly status is BUYING_CLIMAX (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The last three bars show persistent volatility but no significant net progress. The latest bar was a narrow UP bar, closing mid-range (CLV 0.31) on high volume (RelVol 0.73). This volume level suggests demand is active, but the narrow spread indicates supply is absorbing the effort. This is a Test of Supply/Demand battle near the highs, typical near a potential climax.

**Key Levels:** 28.36 (Resistance), 27.08 (Immediate Support), 27.41 (Previous Low Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $28.36 (Bullish) or below $27.08 (Bearish), both on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** N/A (Tight range, waiting for confirmation)
---
### KEY (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Supply Absorption / Consolidation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly status is SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (CONFIRMED_EARLY). The last bar was a wide spread UP bar, but closed in the middle/low range (CLV -0.02) on high volume (RelVol 0.90). This indicates selling pressure absorbed the demand, but the price held the $20.17 low. This is aggressive supply absorption in a tight range, suggesting a major pivot point. Current action suggests high activity but no clear dominance from either side yet, reflecting consolidation.

**Key Levels:** 22.07 (Resistance), 20.17 (Support), 20.98 (Previous Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $22.07 or below $20.17 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** N/A (Waiting for range break)
---
### KYMR (NEUTRAL/BEARISH WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result / Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly status is BUYING_CLIMAX (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The last bar was an UP bar (Spread 6.65), closing mid-range (CLV 0.119) on average volume (RelVol 0.79). This action follows significant downward momentum and shakeouts the preceding two weeks. The weak close suggests demand is struggling to overcome supply near $72.86. The structure remains weak after failing to hold above $74.

**Key Levels:** 72.86 (Resistance), 66.20 (Immediate Support), 69.54 (Previous Low Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $68.00 on increasing selling volume.
- **Invalidation:** $72.86 (Above immediate resistance)
---
### LHX (NEUTRAL/BEARISH WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Weekly status is BUYING_CLIMAX. The last two weeks saw massive spread and volume expansion (RelVol 2.09, 1.38). The most recent bar was a wide UP bar but closed mid-range (CLV 0.41), significantly weaker than the high close (CLV 0.84) the week prior. This is the first indication of major supply entering the market (Effort No Result), challenging the strong uptrend and confirming the climax scenario near $361.59.

**Key Levels:** 361.59 (Buying Climax Peak/Supply), 340.28 (Immediate Support), 335.77 (Prior Pivot)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $340.28 on rising selling volume.
- **Invalidation:** $361.59 (Above the climax peak)

### MAN (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Demand Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly status is SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The last weekly bar was an UP bar, closing mid-range (CLV 0.30) on average volume (RelVol 0.83). This demand bar occurred after a strong test/shakeout the previous week (CLV -0.39, RelVol 0.89). The price held above prior support ($29.40) and consolidated. The close indicates underlying demand is present, preparing for a potential breakout against the monthly supply theme.

**Key Levels:** 31.75 (Resistance), 29.43 (Immediate Support), 28.83 (Swing Low Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close above $31.75 with high volume.
- **Invalidation:** $29.43 (Below recent accumulation support)
---
### NFXL (BULLISH WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax / Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH. The last weekly bar was an aggressive DOWN bar (Spread 4.80), but it closed high (CLV -0.006) on Ultra High Volume (RelVol 3.75). Despite the high volume on a down bar, the inability to close lower (CLV near zero) indicates massive absorption and demand stepping in (Selling Climax). This volume spike signals a potential reversal or major bottoming process is beginning.

**Key Levels:** 27.96 (Immediate Resistance), 23.15 (Selling Climax Low/Support), 25.54 (Recent Close Pivot)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Successful low volume test near $24.00, or a strong push above $28.00.
- **Invalidation:** $23.15 (Below the selling climax low)
---
### NICE (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Reversal Attempt/No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
Weekly analysis shows a wide spread down bar (Week 2026-01-12) on High/Very High Relative Volume (1.46), with the close near the low, indicating strong selling pressure (Selling Climax effect). The following week (2026-01-19) reversed, closing high on high volume (0.97), but the spread was wider, suggesting some stopping volume/absorption. Monthly context is SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The January monthly bar is wide with CLV around neutral/positive (0.13), showing absorption but confirming the preceding supply dominance. Requires confirmation of upward continuation with reduced supply.

**Key Levels:** 118.37 (Recent High), 109.30 (Support/Test Area), 112.19 (Prior Close Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 115.97 on high volume, confirming absorption.
- **Invalidation:** 108.48 (Low of prior selling wave)
---
### OC (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort to Rise (Absorption)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BULLISH. Monthly sequence is STOPPING_VOLUME, suggesting Smart Money accumulation in the prior months. The recent weekly bars show strong upward momentum (2026-01-05 & 2026-01-12) with high volume and high closes, indicating effort to rise and success. The last week (2026-01-19) showed a wide spread up bar, closing middle-high with volume slightly below average (0.83), suggesting the upward move is being sustained, likely absorbing remaining overhead supply. This is constructive bullish behavior in a bullish quarterly trend.

**Key Levels:** 126.92 (Recent High/Resistance), 120.39 (Support), 110.00 (Major Support/Stopping Volume area)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 127.00 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** 119.91 (Low of the last strong move)
---
### ONB (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result (Supply)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the monthly sequence shows CONFIRMED_STRONG SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (likely due to the high volume/wide spread in 2026-01). Weekly 2026-01-19 bar shows a very wide spread up, high volume (0.90), but the close is middle/low (CLV -0.29). This suggests significant effort to push price up met by strong supply (Effort No Result). This is a warning sign, despite the bullish quarterly context. We need to monitor for a successful test of supply/support.

**Key Levels:** 24.78 (Recent High/Supply), 23.50 (Recent Support), 22.87 (Major Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 24.78 on strong volume (Bullish) OR break below 22.87 (Bearish).
- **Invalidation:** 24.78 (High of the supply bar)
---
### PGY (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Lack of Commitment/Supply Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BEARISH, and monthly confirms SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (WATCH_FOR_TEST). Weekly analysis shows erratic behavior. Week 2026-01-05 was a strong upthrust (high volume, high CLV), but immediately followed by a steep down bar (2026-01-12) on high volume (0.91) and a near-zero CLV (-0.93), suggesting an immediate failure to sustain the rally (Effort No Result). The last bar (2026-01-19) is an inside bar with mediocre CLV (0.15) on below-average volume (0.79). This indicates immediate supply is being tested/absorbed, but the volatility suggests uncertainty. Neutral short-term, bearish long-term.

**Key Levels:** 26.80 (Supply Zone/High), 21.87 (Immediate Support), 20.62 (Critical Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 20.62 on increased volume.
- **Invalidation:** 22.68 (High of last down wave)
---
### PSN (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result/Failed Rally

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BEARISH, and monthly confirms SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (CONFIRMED_EARLY). The mid-January weekly bars (2026-01-05 & 2026-01-12) showed a powerful rally on high volume (1.40, 0.74) with very high CLVs (0.97, 0.82), which appeared bullish. However, the last week (2026-01-19) stopped dead, showing a wide spread up bar closing flat (CLV 0.02) on decreased volume (0.66). This is a classical Effort No Result to the upside, suggesting immediate overhead supply absorbed the bullish momentum near 74.62. This failure confirms the underlying bearish trend/monthly supply.

**Key Levels:** 74.63 (Supply Zone/High), 70.74 (Immediate Support), 68.85 (Minor Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 70.74 on high volume.
- **Invalidation:** 74.63 (High of Effort No Result bar)
---
### RARE (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Effort to Rise (Absorption)/Supply Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BEARISH, but the weekly and monthly context show complex supply dominance and high volatility. Weekly 2025-12-29 was a massive Stopping Volume bar (volume 4.56, high CLV 0.85) marking a temporary bottom. The last week (2026-01-19) saw high volume (1.47) and a wide spread up, closing high (CLV 0.74). This is strong demand (Effort to Rise and Success). However, the price is testing strong supply established in the preceding weeks (2026-01-05 closed low, 2026-01-12 closed low). Need confirmation that this supply is truly overcome.

**Key Levels:** 25.09 (Resistance), 24.53 (Immediate High), 22.00 (Spring/Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and sustain above 24.53 on high volume.
- **Invalidation:** 22.00 (Low of the recent demand bar)
---
### RLI (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax/Spring

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BEARISH. Monthly context shows BUYING_CLIMAX (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The weekly sequence shows consistent weakness leading to a potential climactic event. The last bar (2026-01-19) is a wide spread down bar on Very High Volume (1.75), closing middle-low (CLV -0.48). This high volume/wide spread in a downtrend suggests a Selling Climax, potentially marking a bottom (Spring type action). However, the weekly bar closed far from its low, indicating some immediate buying/absorption near the 55.79 level. Neutral until tested.

**Key Levels:** 60.35 (Immediate Resistance), 55.80 (Climax Low/Support), 58.20 (Prior Swing Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a No Supply test near 55.80 or break above 60.35.
- **Invalidation:** 55.80 (Selling Climax Low)
---
### SARO (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BULLISH. Weekly sequence is BUYING_CLIMAX (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The last bar (2026-01-19) is highly climactic: wide spread up on Extremely High Relative Volume (3.96), closing middle-high (CLV 0.07). This suggests a rapid run-up followed by significant Smart Money selling into the strength. The close is far from the high (34.47), indicating strong supply entered the market, generating a potential reversal signal (Buying Climax).

**Key Levels:** 34.48 (Climax Peak/Supply), 32.97 (Immediate Close), 31.22 (Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a No Demand test near 34.48 or confirmation of weakness below 31.22.
- **Invalidation:** 31.22 (Low of the climax bar)
---
### SPOT (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Potential Spring/Reversal

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BEARISH, confirmed by recent wide spread down bars on high volume (2026-01-05 & 2026-01-12) with extremely negative CLVs, indicating strong distribution/panic selling. However, the last bar (2026-01-19) shows signs of exhaustion: wide spread up on Very High Volume (1.59), closing high (CLV 0.70). This suggests Smart Money absorption entering the market near the lows ($491.29). This is a potential Spring or Stopping Volume action following major weakness.

**Key Levels:** 548.55 (Resistance), 491.30 (Spring Low), 500.82 (Prior Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a No Supply test near 491.30 or break above 517.00.
- **Invalidation:** 491.30 (Low of the reversal bar)
---
### SYF (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BEARISH. Weekly sequence is STOPPING_VOLUME (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The 2026-01-12 bar was a wide spread down on Very High Volume (1.85), closing mid-range (CLV 0.52), which is atypical, suggesting strong intra-bar absorption/demand. The last bar (2026-01-19) is a wide spread down on Very High Volume (1.42), closing mid-low (CLV -0.40). This confirms continued selling but the volume remains climactic, hinting at a potential accumulation area after the shakeout to $74.94. The high volume is likely Smart Money either accumulating or liquidating secondary positions. Neutral until confirmation of reversal or continuation.

**Key Levels:** 81.84 (Resistance), 74.95 (Climax Low/Support), 77.73 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a No Supply test near 75.00 or break above 80.20.
- **Invalidation:** 74.95 (Selling Climax Low)
---
### WGMI (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Reversal/No Supply Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BULLISH. Monthly sequence is BUYING_CLIMAX (WATCH_FOR_TEST), suggesting the high may be tested. Weekly analysis shows sustained demand. The 2026-01-12 bar was strong (high CLV 0.80, wide spread) on average volume (0.82). The last bar (2026-01-19) shows a wide spread up, closing high (CLV 0.37) on volume of 1.02. While volume is slightly higher, the price managed to overcome the early supply (open $48.68, low $45.11). The close near the high signals successful absorption of supply and continued effort to rise, overcoming the potential negative signal from the high monthly CLV.

**Key Levels:** 51.78 (Recent High/Target), 48.68 (Immediate Support), 45.11 (Support/Test Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 51.78 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** 45.11 (Low of the last swing)

## Other
### BAH (NEUTRAL-TO-BEARISH (Potential Climax))
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result (Up) / High Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly Trend is BULLISH, Monthly is BUYING_CLIMAX. The last bar is a wide spread up, closing near the middle (CLV 0.13) on the highest volume in the sequence (RelVol 1.50). This VSA signal, 'Effort No Result' (up bar, wide spread, high volume, low CLV), suggests Smart Money selling into the rally. The inability to close strong despite the massive influx of volume indicates overwhelming supply at 109.00, marking a potential top.

**Key Levels:** 109.10 (Climax High/Supply), 96.73 (Immediate Support), 93.28 (Swing Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on failure to break 109.10 or a break below 96.73.
- **Invalidation:** Sustained break and strong close above 109.10.
