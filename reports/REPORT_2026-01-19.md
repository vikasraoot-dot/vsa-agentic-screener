M 01/01 markdown on extremely low volume (0.33) confirms No Supply. Wk 5 dropped deep but recovered significantly (CLV 0.20) on low volume (0.81). This low volume drop and strong rebound confirm a successful VSA Test at the 121.55 demand zone.

**Key Levels:** 121.55 (Test Low/Support), 128.30 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan

- **Invalidation:** 121.55

### CCEP (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Demand Confirmation (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly bar showed a successful Test/reversal (M 01/01, low volume dip followed by strong close). Wk 5 continued the rally on high volume (1.35) and closed strong (CLV 0.69). This is strong follow-through demand confirming the conclusion of the Test phase.

**Key Levels:** 87.11 (Support), 89.68 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan

### CCK (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Weekly Test/No Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
M 01/01 consolidation occurred on very low volume (0.48), confirming No Supply. Wk 5 dropped to test demand on lower volume (0.76) compared to the preceding demand bar (Wk 4). This successful Test indicates sellers are depleted and demand is ready to drive price higher.

**Key Levels:** 102.94 (Test Low/Support), 106.27 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 104.52 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** 102.94
---
### CHDN (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Weekly Stopping Volume / Shakeout

**Smart Money Logic:**
M 01/01 markdown was a Test on lower volume (0.79). Wk 5 followed with a deep drop met by high volume (1.46) absorption, resulting in a strong rebound off the 104.19 low (CLV -0.34). This Stopping Volume bar confirms Smart Money accumulation after the shakeout.

**Key Levels:** 104.19 (SV Low/Support), 112.33 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close above 108.23 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** 104.19
---
### CI (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Monthly Test / Weekly Absorption

**Smart Money Logic:**
M 01/01 markdown occurred on very low volume (0.52), signaling supply exhaustion (Test). Wk 5 saw selling pressure (RelVol 1.08) but the price rebounded from the 268.95 low, closing mid-range (CLV -0.38). This absorption suggests demand is stepping in decisively (Stopping Volume) after the shakeout.

**Key Levels:** 268.95 (SV Low/Support), 279.50 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 275 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** 268.95
---
### CIVI (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Monthly Test/No Supply / Weekly Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
M 01/01 markdown on very low volume (0.41) confirms supply exhaustion (No Supply/Test). Wk 4 was the shakeout, and Wk 5 followed with a low volume down bar, confirming a successful short-term Test near the 25.60 demand area. Ready for upward continuation.

**Key Levels:** 25.60 (Test Low/Support), 27.94 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close above 26.89 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** 25.60
---
### RRC (BULLISH (Short-Term Reversal Attempt))
**VSA Status:** Monthly Test Observed, Confirmed Upthrust/Weakness

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart shows a wide spread down in Dec 2025 (CLV -0.58), followed by Jan 2026 which acts as a Test (lower volume 0.70, but closing higher CLV 0.25). This low volume Test after heavy prior selling suggests Supply is clearing up. The last Weekly bar is very strong (high CLV 0.96, good spread, high volume 1.25 RelVol), indicating immediate demand driving the price up from the lows (32.68). This looks like a successful immediate Test/Reversal following recent downside pressure.

**Key Levels:** Monthly Test Low/Support: 32.68, Immediate Resistance: 35.05 (Prior weekly high), Accumulation Area: 33.00 - 34.50

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry on pullbacks towards 33.50 - 34.00, or confirmed break above 34.50.
- **Invalidation:** A close below 32.68 (Last Monthly/Weekly Low).
---
### RTO (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Weekly Stopping Volume/Shakeout

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last Weekly bar saw very high volume (2.29 RelVol), a wide spread down, but the CLV is positive (0.16), meaning the closing price was well off the low (30.62). This suggests massive selling absorbed by institutional buying, a classic Stopping Volume or Shakeout action. This is the first high-volume down move since the strong up move two weeks prior (CLV 0.81). Trend strength remains bullish (Monthly CLV 0.52).

**Key Levels:** Stopping Volume Low/Support: 30.62, Immediate Resistance: 32.20, Prior Support: 29.70

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry above the close of the Stopping Volume bar (31.54) or on a low volume Test of 31.00.
- **Invalidation:** A close below 30.60.
---
### RYAAY (BULLISH (Short-Term Reversal Potential))
**VSA Status:** Weekly Stopping Volume, Monthly Test/Shakeout

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart shows sharp downside move in Jan 2026 (CLV -0.69) but on very low volume (0.47 RelVol), signaling a Test of prior absorption (Dec 2025 high CLV 0.62). The last Weekly bar is high volume (1.59 RelVol) with a wide spread down, but the CLV is effectively neutral (0.013). This confirms institutional absorption (Stopping Volume/Shakeout) at the lows (67.19), clearing out weak holders. Given the monthly volume profile, this indicates potential final selling being absorbed.

**Key Levels:** Stopping Volume Low/Support: 67.19, Immediate Resistance: 69.34 (Weekly high), Monthly Resistance: 74.24

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry on a narrow spread up bar, or confirmation above 69.00.
- **Invalidation:** A close below 67.19.
---
### STAA (BULLISH (Potential Accumulation))
**VSA Status:** Weekly Stopping Volume/Shakeout

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last two Weekly bars show significant volatility on extremely high volume (2.72 and 1.91 RelVol). The second-to-last bar (Jan 05) was wide spread down, closing near the middle (CLV 0.036), indicating absorption. The most recent bar continued down, testing the low (19.40), also on high volume, and closed mid-range (CLV -0.042). This volatile, high-volume action near lows suggests a major Shakeout/Selling Climax phase. The Monthly CLV is negative (-0.35), but the price has reached potential accumulation grounds.

**Key Levels:** Selling Climax Low/Support: 19.40, Immediate Resistance: 22.12, Breakout Level: 23.35

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry upon a close above 21.00 or a low-volume Test of the 19.40 low.
- **Invalidation:** A close below 19.30.
---
### SYF (BULLISH (Confirmed Absorption))
**VSA Status:** Weekly Stopping Volume, Monthly Test/Shakeout

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart shows a wide range down bar in Jan 2026 on low volume (0.68 RelVol), marking a Test of the prior up move, but closing poorly (CLV -0.24). However, the final Weekly bar provides decisive confirmation: Extremely high volume (2.17 RelVol) on a very wide spread down, but closing firmly off the lows (CLV 0.52). This is a textbook Shakeout/Stopping Volume event, suggesting institutional buyers aggressively stepped in at 74.95.

**Key Levels:** Stopping Volume Low/Support: 74.95, Immediate Resistance: 81.84, Accumulation Zone: 78.00 - 80.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry on a narrow spread up bar following the stopping volume, targeting resistance breaks.
- **Invalidation:** A close below 74.95.
---
### TRU (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Weekly No Supply, Weekly Test Observed (Confirmed Demand)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last Weekly bar is low volume (0.64 RelVol) and relatively wide spread up, closing high (CLV 0.66). This is a classic No Supply signal, confirming the market has absorbed selling pressure and is ready to advance. This follows a strong absorption bar (Jan 05, CLV 0.649) that successfully tested prior support (81.08). The overall setup suggests accumulation is complete and a markup phase is beginning. Monthly CLV is neutral/positive (0.27).

**Key Levels:** Weekly Support/Test Low: 82.58, Accumulation Zone: 81.08 - 84.00, Resistance: 89.12

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry immediately above the high of the No Supply bar (86.95), or on any shallow pullback towards 85.00.
- **Invalidation:** A close below 82.50.
---
### UPS (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Weekly No Supply, Weekly Test Observed (Confirmed Demand)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart shows low relative volume (0.51 RelVol) in Jan 2026, but the close is strong (CLV 0.50). This suggests demand is returning following the large up bar two weeks ago. The last Weekly bar is a down bar on lower volume (0.77 RelVol), closing slightly low (CLV -0.46). This low volume pullback serves as a classic No Supply/Test after the strong rally that pierced previous resistance (102.89). The reaction suggests minor profit taking, not sustained distribution.

**Key Levels:** Support/Test Low: 106.15, Immediate Support (Prior Resistance): 102.89, Resistance: 109.67

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry on a strong close above 107.00, or confirmation of support holding at 106.15.
- **Invalidation:** A close below 106.00.
---
### VKTX (BULLISH (Potential Accumulation Phase))
**VSA Status:** Monthly Test Observed, Confirmed Absorption

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart shows selling deceleration (Jan 2026 volume 0.56 RelVol) acting as a Test. Crucially, the last Weekly bar is wide spread up on high volume (1.32 RelVol), closing mid-range (CLV 0.35). The bar tested down to 29.53 (a potential Spring level) and reversed significantly. This high volume reversal off the absolute low of the period suggests strong institutional accumulation (Stopping Volume/Shakeout) at the 29.53 area. The prior two monthly bars showed selling pressure, but this recent shakeout suggests reversal potential.

**Key Levels:** Stopping Volume Low/Support: 29.53, Immediate Resistance: 36.00, Accumulation Zone: 29.50 - 32.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry on a pullback towards 32.50 or confirmed continuation above 34.50.
- **Invalidation:** A close below 29.50.
---
### WAL (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Weekly No Supply, Weekly Test Observed (Continuation)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart shows low volume (0.37 RelVol) in Jan 2026, but the bar closed positively (CLV 0.26), indicating a successful Test. The last Weekly bar is low volume (0.68 RelVol) and closed mid-range (CLV -0.17). Crucially, the price tested the 86.68 low and rebounded, signifying No Supply/low selling pressure following the strong buying bar of Jan 05 (CLV 0.57). This setup confirms the prior accumulation/markup phase is resuming.

**Key Levels:** Weekly Test Low/Support: 86.68, Immediate Support: 88.00, Resistance: 91.56

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry above 88.50, targeting a move toward 91.56.
- **Invalidation:** A close below 86.60.
---
### ZBH (NEUTRAL/BULLISH Bias)
**VSA Status:** Monthly Test Observed, Major Shakeout/Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart shows lower volume (0.79 RelVol) in Jan 2026, acting as a Test, but the price closed poorly (CLV -0.67). However, the last Weekly bar saw extreme high volume (1.95 RelVol) with a wide spread down, closing well off the low (CLV -0.60). The low was 85.76. This combination of heavy volume and a close significantly above the low, following a month of pressure, suggests a major Shakeout/Stopping Volume event occurred near the 85.76 level, indicating institutional accumulation.

**Key Levels:** Stopping Volume Low/Support: 85.76, Monthly Support: 84.49 (from prior data), Resistance: 93.62

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry on a narrow spread up bar or a confirmed Test of 86.50.
- **Invalidation:** A close below 85.75.

**VSA Status:** Supply Coming In

**Smart Money Logic:**
The latest weekly bar (01/12) shows very high volume (RelVol 1.45) on a wide down bar closing near the low (CLV -0.91). This aggressive selling confirms Supply Coming In, suggesting sellers remain firmly in control following weak price action throughout January.

---
### AER (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Monthly No Supply / Weekly Absorption

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly markdown (M 01/01) on very low volume (0.42) confirms seller exhaustion (No Supply). Wk 5 shows price stabilizing around 142.80, bouncing off the low 141.52. This suggests accumulation following a shakeout, confirming the monthly Test environment.

**Key Levels:** 141.52 (Support/Test Low), 145.88 (Resistance)

---
### ALKT (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Coming In

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar (01/12) shows high volume (RelVol 1.25) on a wide down spread closing almost exactly at the low (CLV -0.89). This is a clear Supply Coming In (SCI) signal, indicating sustained distribution and likely continuation of the markdown phase.

- **Invalidation:** 22.73
---
### AON (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Monthly Test/No Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly bar (M 01/01) registered very low volume (0.45) during its markdown, signaling a successful Test for lack of supply. Wk 5 was a down bar on slight volume increase (1.03), acting as a final shakeout before the presumed resumption of the upward trend from the 339.39 support.

**Key Levels:** 339.39 (Support), 353.92 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and hold above 345 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** 339.39
---
### AZN (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Weekly Shakeout/Test (Extreme Volume)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Wk 5 saw extreme relative volume (4.83) on an average spread down bar that closed poorly (CLV -0.09). This volume spike, following a strong demand bar (Wk 4), indicates a massive shakeout or test of market depth. Since the bar is not ultra-wide and the stock is in a broad uptrend, we interpret this as Smart Money absorbing large supply (Test/SV) before moving higher.

**Key Levels:** 92.77 (SV Low/Support), 96.43 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Confirmation move above 94.42 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** 92.77
---
### BFAM (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Monthly Test / Weekly Shakeout

M 01/01 pullback on low volume (0.68) confirmed Test/No Supply. Wk 5 saw high volume (1.17) driving price down, but the subsequent close was mid-low, recovering substantially from the 94.48 low. This shakeout confirmed demand stepping in (SV).

**Key Levels:** 94.48 (Shakeout Low/Support), 102.93 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close above 97.00 on volume, confirming demand return.
- **Invalidation:** 94.48
---
### BILL (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Coming In

**Smart Money Logic:**
Wk 5 exhibited high volume (1.14) on a wide down bar, closing almost at the low (CLV -0.97). This signals aggressive Supply Coming In (SCI). Despite the lower monthly volume, the immediate supply pressure is overwhelming, suggesting further markdown is likely.

**Key Levels:** 46.50 (Support), 54.29 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan

- **Invalidation:** 54.47
---

**Smart Money Logic:**
M 01/01 markdown occurred on low volume (0.59). Wk 5 confirmed weakness with above-average volume (1.02) driving price aggressively down, closing near the low (CLV -0.90). This SCI signal suggests price is likely to test lower areas before finding meaningful demand.

**Key Levels:** 54.36 (Support), 59.02 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for clear Stopping Volume signal.
- **Invalidation:** 59.45
---

**VSA Status:** Supply Coming In

**Smart Money Logic:**

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for clear Stopping Volume signal below 38.84.
- **Invalidation:** 41.16
---
### CB (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Coming In

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly reversal (M 01/01) resulted in an extremely poor close on low volume. This weakness was confirmed by Wk 5, which saw high volume (1.08) fail to reverse the markdown, closing poorly (CLV -0.66). This is Supply Coming In, suggesting sellers are dominating the current price action.

**Key Levels:** 299.02 (Support), 309.38 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 299.02 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** 307.07
---
### CDW (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Monthly Test/No Supply / Weekly Absorption

**Smart Money Logic:**
M 01/01 saw a markdown on greatly reduced volume (0.65), indicating a Test for supply exhaustion. Wk 5 dropped on high volume (1.12) to 130.44 but recovered to close mid-low. This aggressive absorption action suggests demand is building a base (Accumulation/SV) after the shakeout.

**Key Levels:** 130.44 (SV Low/Support), 136.08 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 133.50 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** 130.44
---
### CELC (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Weekly Effort No Result (ENR)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Wk 5 saw a very wide spread up, but the close was poor (CLV -0.18) despite relatively low volume (0.65). This indicates that the upside effort achieved no substantial result, suggesting underlying supply is successfully entering the market (Effort No Result). The monthly bar also had a weak close after a major up move.

**Key Levels:** 100.37 (Support), 116.44 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for clear Test of the high supply zone (116).
- **Invalidation:** 116.44
---
### CHTR (BEARISH)

**Smart Money Logic:**
M 01/01 showed a massive reversal. Wk 5 confirmed this shift, printing high volume (1.18) on a very wide down bar, closing aggressively near the low (CLV -0.83). This signals strong and immediate Supply Coming In (SCI), indicating professional distribution and likely continuation of the decline.

**Key Levels:** 187.85 (Support), 211.14 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for clear Stopping Volume signal.
- **Invalidation:** 205.00
---

**VSA Status:** Monthly Test/No Supply / Weekly Absorption

**Smart Money Logic:**
M 01/01 markdown on low volume (0.49) confirms supply exhaustion (Test). Wk 5 saw volume increase (1.15) on a drop, but the price closed mid-range (CLV -0.51), rejecting the 25.14 low. This is aggressive absorption (Stopping Volume), suggesting Smart Money is building a base.

**Key Levels:** 25.14 (SV Low/Support), 27.20 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close above 27.01 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** 25.14
---
### REGN (BEARISH/CAUTION (Potential Re-accumulation/Correction))
**VSA Status:** Monthly No Supply, Weakness on Weekly

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart shows a No Supply signal (low volume) on the Jan 2026 bar, but this bar is a wide spread down bar (CLV -0.86) closing near the low, suggesting distribution/weakness, not true absorption. The Weekly chart confirms heavy selling on the last bar (high volume, wide spread down, CLV -0.84), which broke below previous support levels (765/770 area). The high volume suggests professional selling or panic liquidation. Needs aggressive absorption before bullish confirmation.

**Key Levels:** Monthly Support: 726.43 (Low of Jan 2026 bar), Prior Weekly Lows: 765.09, 753.20, Resistance: 792.77 (Previous High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Weekly Up bar on high/rising volume and high CLV, confirming institutional absorption above 750, OR a clear Test of the 726 low on low volume.
- **Invalidation:** A close below 726.40 (Monthly low).
---
### RLI (BEARISH/CAUTION)
**VSA Status:** Monthly No Supply, Weakness Continues

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart (Jan 2026) shows low relative volume (0.84), but it's a down bar closing near its low (CLV -0.58). This is technically a No Demand/No Supply pattern after two months of decline, suggesting institutional absence, but the price action is weak. The last two Weekly bars are down bars, with the last bar testing the low of the spread but closing neutral/low (CLV -0.008, 1.12 RelVol). This suggests possible temporary slowing of the downtrend but no strong sign of buying yet.

**Key Levels:** Monthly Support: 58.20 (Low of Jan 2026 bar), Resistance: 61.88 (Prior weekly open), Major Resistance: 64.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A definitive Spring of 58.20 or a Weekly Up bar with strong CLV and high volume.
- **Invalidation:** A close below 58.20.
---
### RSG (NEUTRAL/BULLISH Bias)
**VSA Status:** Monthly Test Observed, Neutral Weekly Close

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart shows December weakness (CLV -0.22), followed by a lower volume (0.67 RelVol) January bar that managed a mid-range close (CLV -0.06). While the CLV is slightly negative, the lower volume suggests a test of supply on the monthly scale. The last Weekly bar moved down into the support zone (207.90) on decent volume (1.24 RelVol) but closed in the middle/upper half (CLV 0.137), indicating demand absorbing weakness near the low. This is a possible minor accumulation sign (Shakeout/Test).

**Key Levels:** Monthly Test Low/Support: 207.90, Accumulation Zone: 207.90 - 210.00, Resistance: 214.47

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close above 212.50 on high volume.
- **Invalidation:** A close below 207.80.
---
### RYTM (BEARISH/CAUTION)
**VSA Status:** Monthly Test Observed, Continued Weakness

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart shows Dec 2025 weakness (CLV -0.36) followed by Jan 2026, which is a Test (lower volume 0.59 RelVol), but the closing action is poor (CLV -0.38), indicating sellers remain dominant. The Weekly trend is clearly down, with the last bar showing an extremely wide spread up (14.43 spread) but closing near the low (CLV -0.71). This looks like Effort No Result to the downside, with sellers maintaining control despite a wide fluctuation. The high of 114.0 suggests a significant rally failed.

**Key Levels:** Monthly Low/Support: 96.20, Immediate Resistance: 104.71, Key Resistance: 114.00 (Failed rally high)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Strong weekly close above 105.00 on sustained high volume.
- **Invalidation:** A close below 96.20.
---
### SONY (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Monthly No Supply, Distribution Confirmed

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart (Jan 2026) is a wide spread down bar, closing near the low (CLV -0.89) on relatively low volume (0.69 RelVol). While VSA sometimes flags low volume down bars as No Supply, this bar confirms distribution started in December (CLV -0.73). The Weekly chart shows aggressive high volume selling (1.66 RelVol) on the last bar, closing near the low (CLV -0.82). This is strong confirmation of professional selling and price decline.

**Key Levels:** Monthly Support: 23.93, Prior Weekly Support (now Resistance): 25.04, Immediate Resistance: 25.33

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a selling climax or clear stopping volume signal near 23.00.
- **Invalidation:** A close above 25.40 (to indicate absorption).
---
### SSNC (NEUTRAL/CAUTION)
**VSA Status:** Monthly Test Observed, Weak Close

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart shows distribution pressure (Dec CLV 0.07, narrow spread but weakness relative to Oct), followed by a Test in Jan 2026 (low volume 0.61 RelVol). However, the Jan bar closed significantly weak (CLV -0.47). The last Weekly bar confirms this tepid demand. High volume (1.48 RelVol) but a down bar closing near the low (CLV -0.11), suggesting the increased volume was likely selling into attempts to rally, or panic selling without clear absorption.

**Key Levels:** Monthly Low/Support: 84.49, Immediate Support: 85.26 (Prior weekly open), Resistance: 87.40

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Clear Test of 84.49 followed by a strong recovery bar (Up Bar, High CLV, Low/Medium Volume).
- **Invalidation:** A close below 84.49.
---
### TD (NEUTRAL/CAUTION)
**VSA Status:** Monthly Test Observed, No Supply/Weakness

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart (Jan 2026) is a down bar on lower volume (0.74 RelVol) and closed in the lower third (CLV -0.22). This suggests supply is present following the big December rally. It acts as a No Supply/Test, but the weak close implies supply is winning the current battle. The last Weekly bar is a down bar on rising volume (1.29 RelVol), closing mid-range (CLV 0.127). The overall volume pattern shows exhaustion/weakness on the monthly timeframe.

**Key Levels:** Monthly Support: 92.22, Immediate Support: 93.85, Resistance: 96.44

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry only upon a clear low-volume Test of 92.22 followed by an up move.
- **Invalidation:** A close below 92.20.

### THC (BEARISH/CAUTION)
**VSA Status:** Monthly Test Observed, Weakness Continues

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart shows deceleration of selling (Jan 2026 volume 0.35 RelVol) following heavy selling in Dec 2025. This low volume suggests a Test of supply, but the close is very weak (CLV -0.68). The last Weekly bar is a down bar on rising volume, closing in the lower half (CLV -0.37). The price failed to sustain a rally past 202.71. Weakness remains, but the low monthly volume hints that the selling pressure might be running dry, requiring careful watching for a reversal.

**Key Levels:** Monthly Test Low/Support: 194.04, Immediate Resistance: 199.00 (Last Weekly Open), Major Resistance: 211.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Confirmed Spring of 194.04 or a strong move above 200.00 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** A close below 194.00.

### TMO (NEUTRAL/CAUTION)
**VSA Status:** Weekly Stopping Volume, Possible Re-Distribution

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last Weekly bar saw high volume (1.70 RelVol) but closed off the low (CLV 0.37), indicating absorption (Stopping Volume). However, this stopping volume follows a strong rally up to 629.87. The wide spread down on high volume suggests profit-taking or shorting by smart money at the top of the range. Monthly CLV is strong (0.57), indicating the long-term trend remains positive, but a pullback is likely after this high-volume selling.

**Key Levels:** Stopping Volume Low/Support: 594.30, Monthly Support: 577.00, Resistance: 629.87

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A low volume Test of the 594.30 area or a strong up bar closing above 620.00.
- **Invalidation:** A close below 594.30.

### TPR (BEARISH (Short-term weakness))
**VSA Status:** Weekly No Supply (Ultra-high CLV), Possible Shakeout

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last Weekly bar is a wide spread down bar on average volume (0.80 RelVol) but shows an ultra-negative CLV (-0.98), meaning it closed right on the low (130.69). This is a strong signal of weakness/selling pressure dominating. Although the Monthly chart shows bullish accumulation prior to Jan 2026, the current monthly bar has seen lower volume (0.31 RelVol) and a weak close (CLV -0.20), suggesting a failed Test or inability to advance. The recent weekly action suggests distribution or a shakeout of weak hands.

**Key Levels:** Weekly Support: 130.66, Monthly Support: 127.15, Resistance: 135.97

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A definitive Spring of 127.15 or recovery above 132.00 on strong volume.
- **Invalidation:** A close below 127.15.

### TSLR (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Weakness Confirmed (Failed Monthly/Weekly Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Both Monthly and Weekly charts show continued weakness. The Monthly chart (Jan 2026) is low volume (0.34 RelVol), acting as a No Supply/Test, but the CLV is poor (-0.31). The last Weekly bar is also low volume (0.63 RelVol), wide spread down, closing near the low (CLV -0.71). The combined signals indicate that despite low supply, the price is failing to rally, suggesting underlying weakness or continued lack of demand. The prior absorption attempt in Jan 05 (CLV 0.20) was immediately negated.

**Key Levels:** Monthly Low/Critical Support: 28.35, Immediate Resistance: 31.15, Failed High: 33.18

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a clear sign of professional buying or a break and close above 31.50.
- **Invalidation:** A close below 29.60 (Last weekly low).
---
### UNM (BEARISH/CAUTION)
**VSA Status:** Monthly Test Observed, Confirmed Weakness/Distribution

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart (Jan 2026) shows lower volume (0.60 RelVol) but closes extremely weak (CLV -0.66). This looks like a failed Test, suggesting previous demand has evaporated and supply is now dominant. The last Weekly bar is a wide spread down bar on high volume (1.44 RelVol), closing near the low (CLV -0.66). This is a strong signal of distribution/panic selling pushing the price down from recent highs (81.16).

**Key Levels:** Monthly Support: 75.07, Immediate Resistance: 77.23 (Prior weekly close), Resistance: 81.16 (Last Weekly High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a selling climax or strong absorption signal near 75.00.
- **Invalidation:** A close above 78.00.
---
### UNP (NEUTRAL/BULLISH Bias)
**VSA Status:** Monthly Test Observed, Consolidation/Neutral

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart shows a significant drop in volume (0.53 RelVol) in Jan 2026, marking a Test after the prior weakness (Dec CLV -0.67). The bar closed neutrally (CLV -0.05), suggesting supply has eased significantly. The last Weekly bar is moderate volume (1.01 RelVol), wide spread up, closing strongly (CLV 0.297) after testing the 225.00 low. This suggests immediate demand and minor accumulation taking place in the range.

**Key Levels:** Monthly Low/Support: 224.32, Immediate Resistance: 231.92, Breakout Level: 235.25

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close above 230.00, or a low volume Test of 225.00.
- **Invalidation:** A close below 224.30.
---
### USB (NEUTRAL/BULLISH Bias)
**VSA Status:** Weekly Stopping Volume, Minor Shakeout

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last Weekly bar saw extremely high volume (1.85 RelVol). It was a wide spread bar that tested the lows (53.23) but closed well off the low (CLV 0.32). This is Stopping Volume, indicating significant institutional buying absorbed the selling pressure. The Monthly chart is currently weak (CLV -0.12), suggesting a potential pullback is underway, but the weekly absorption is a strong short-term bullish sign. This looks like a shakeout within a bullish context.

**Key Levels:** Stopping Volume Low/Support: 53.23, Immediate Resistance: 55.00, Monthly Resistance: 56.20

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry on a low volume Test of 53.50 or a strong close above 54.50.
- **Invalidation:** A close below 53.20.
---
### WMG (NEUTRAL/CAUTION)
**VSA Status:** Monthly Test Observed, Weak Weekly Close

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart shows very low volume (0.56 RelVol) in Jan 2026, closing neutrally (CLV 0.12). This represents a Test of the prior absorption (Dec CLV 0.92). The low volume suggests supply is absent. However, the last Weekly bar is a down bar on rising volume (1.02 RelVol) closing poorly (CLV -0.64). This poor weekly close negates the strongly bullish prior week (CLV 0.87). This suggests a short-term failure to sustain the up move, potentially requiring a deeper test.

**Key Levels:** Monthly Low/Support: 29.26, Immediate Support: 30.37, Resistance: 31.62

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A low volume Test of the 29.50 area followed by strong bullish bar.
- **Invalidation:** A close below 29.26.

### WRB (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Monthly No Supply, Weakness Confirmed

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart (Jan 2026) is a down bar on lower volume (0.68 RelVol), flagged as 'No Supply' but closing extremely weak (CLV -0.82). This signals significant weakness and selling pressure despite the overall low volume, suggesting institutional abandonment or confirmation of distribution. The last Weekly bar continues this weakness, closing near the low (CLV -0.71) on average volume (1.00 RelVol). No sign of major demand yet.

**Key Levels:** Monthly Support: 67.57, Immediate Resistance: 68.81 (Prior weekly open), Major Resistance: 71.08

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a selling climax or strong absorption around 67.50.
- **Invalidation:** A close below 67.50.
---
### WYNN (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Monthly No Supply, Distribution Confirmed

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart shows a wide spread down bar in Jan 2026 on extremely low volume (0.29 RelVol), closing near the absolute low (CLV -0.89). While this is technically 'No Supply', the price action is aggressively bearish, confirming distribution (Dec CLV -0.94). The low volume confirms the lack of institutional interest and aggressive abandonment. The last Weekly bar continues the downtrend, closing near the low (CLV -0.78). Severe weakness persists.

**Key Levels:** Monthly Support: 113.81, Immediate Resistance: 116.18, Resistance: 118.75

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a clear sign of absorption or reversal near 113.81.
- **Invalidation:** A close above 118.00 (to negate weakness).
---
### YOU (NEUTRAL/CAUTION)
**VSA Status:** Monthly Test Observed, Indecision/Weak Close

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart shows low relative volume (0.43 RelVol) in Jan 2026, acting as a Test after Dec distribution (CLV -0.45). The Jan bar closed poorly (CLV -0.076). The last Weekly bar is high volume (1.17 RelVol) but showed an indecisive close (CLV 0.073), unable to hold the high ground. This suggests that while selling has subsided on the monthly view, demand is not strong enough to overcome recent distribution pressures.

**Key Levels:** Monthly Low/Support: 33.25, Immediate Support: 34.38 (Prior weekly close), Resistance: 36.86

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A definitive close above 36.00 on strong volume, confirming absorption.
- **Invalidation:** A close below 33.25.
---
### YPF (BEARISH/CAUTION)
**VSA Status:** Monthly Test Observed, Weak Close

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart (Jan 2026) is on very low volume (0.43 RelVol), signaling a Test, but the closing action is weak (CLV -0.21). This suggests that despite the low supply, demand is absent, confirming underlying weakness. The last Weekly bar is low volume (0.73 RelVol) and closed weakly (CLV -0.05). Price is attempting to hold a support area (33.32) but lacks the volume confirmation for accumulation.

**Key Levels:** Monthly Low/Support: 32.74, Immediate Support: 33.32, Resistance: 35.42

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Confirmed volume absorption (Stopping Volume) near 32.74, or a strong up bar closing above 35.00.
- **Invalidation:** A close below 32.70.
---
### YUMC (BEARISH/CAUTION)
**VSA Status:** Monthly Test Observed, Confirmed Weakness

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart shows very low volume (0.25 RelVol) in Jan 2026, a clear Test, but the weak close (CLV -0.275) indicates institutional demand is lacking. The last Weekly bar saw rising volume (1.00 RelVol) but was a wide spread down bar closing poorly (CLV -0.56). This points to increased supply entering the market, negating the prior week's small bullishness (CLV -0.27). Weakness persists in the absence of demand.

**Key Levels:** Monthly Low/Support: 46.55, Immediate Resistance: 48.17 (Last Weekly Open), Resistance: 49.30

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a clear high volume absorption bar (Stopping Volume) or a rally above 48.50.
- **Invalidation:** A close below 46.55.
---
### ZM (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Monthly No Supply, Distribution Confirmed

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart (Jan 2026) shows extremely low volume (0.51 RelVol) with a wide spread down, closing near the low (CLV -0.89). This confirms institutional abandonment and strong selling pressure. The last Weekly bar reinforces this narrative: wide spread down, high volume (1.11 RelVol), closing near the low (CLV -0.89). This is a strong sign of distribution continuing, likely pushing the stock lower toward major support levels.

**Key Levels:** Monthly Support: 80.58, Immediate Resistance: 83.55 (Prior weekly open), Resistance: 87.92

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a selling climax or strong absorption signal near 80.00.
- **Invalidation:** A close above 84.00.
