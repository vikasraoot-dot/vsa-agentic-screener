## 🚀 Ready for Entry
### AL (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
This ticker is currently in a very tight trading range near highs, consistent with consolidation within a bullish quarterly trend. All five recent weekly candles have extremely tight spreads and low volume (RelVol consistently below 0.7), typical of low volatility accumulation or range movement. The last candle (2026-01-26) showed a slight down close on exceptionally low volume (RelVol 0.37) and a tight spread, fulfilling the conditions for 'No Supply' or No Demand (in this case, lack of selling pressure is positive). The monthly context is a Buying Climax Watch, meaning the breakout needs confirmation.

**Key Levels:** 64.50 (Resistance/Range High), 64.12 (Immediate Support/Range Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $64.50 on increased volume.
- **Invalidation:** $64.12 (Break below signals failed consolidation)
---
### ALL (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Weak Rally

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly chart displays confirmed Supply Dominance. The 2026-01-12 week saw a massive down-move (Spread 18.9) closing near the low (-0.94 CLV) on huge volume (RelVol 2.04), confirming strong institutional selling. The last two weeks saw a weak rally attempt on diminishing volume. The 2026-01-26 candle closed up (0.64 CLV) but on very low volume (RelVol 0.43). This confirms institutional supply is dominant, and the recent rally is likely a weak reaction (Lack of Demand) or potential upthrust prior to markdown continuation.

**Key Levels:** 215.00 (Supply High), 191.80 (Selling Climax Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $192.28 (2026-01-12 low close) on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** $198.32 (High of the recent weak rally)
---
### AMZU (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result Down

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is bearish, but recent action suggests accumulation. The 2026-01-05 week showed a very strong up-move (wide spread, high CLV 0.94) on high volume (RelVol 1.08). The last two weeks were pullbacks. The most recent week (2026-01-26) was a down-close on a tight spread, closing mid-range (0.04 CLV) on very low volume (RelVol 0.46). This low volume reaction to the downside, following a strong up-move, suggests a successful low-volume Test for supply absorption, indicating demand is likely ready to take over. This aligns with the monthly chart's 'Supply Dominance: Watch for Test' phase turning into accumulation.

**Key Levels:** 40.40 (Recent High/Supply), 36.57 (Test Support Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $38.20 (2026-01-26 close) with volume, confirming the test successful.
- **Invalidation:** $36.57 (Low of the last Test candle)
---
### ARE (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Reversal

**Smart Money Logic:**
The market has shown clear signs of a Buying Climax. The weeks of 2026-01-12 and 2026-01-19 showed strong up-moves on average volume, setting new highs. However, the last weekly candle (2026-01-26) showed a dramatic reversal: wide spread down, closing near the absolute low (-0.97 CLV) on high volume (RelVol 0.85). This is classic selling pressure (Supply) overwhelming demand at the top of the range, likely marking the end of the markup phase and the start of distribution/markdown.

**Key Levels:** 59.76 (Buying Climax High), 54.55 (Immediate Support/Distribution Start)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $54.55 on follow-through volume.
- **Invalidation:** $59.75 (Climax High)
---
### AXTA (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply (Weekly) / Stopping Volume (Monthly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is bullish, and the monthly chart shows a strong up-close and Stopping Volume Watch. The weekly activity shows steady upward movement with decreasing volatility. The 2026-01-12 and 2026-01-19 candles show strong closes (high CLV) indicating demand. The final candle (2026-01-26) was a narrow spread up-close (0.25 CLV) on very low volume (RelVol 0.38). This low volume up-move is not concerning in this context, and the narrow range suggests a 'No Supply' condition, confirming the path of least resistance is up following successful accumulation (implied by the Stopping Volume monthly signal).

**Key Levels:** 34.44 (Recent High), 33.42 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $34.44 on high volume.
- **Invalidation:** $33.42 (Break below signals short-term failure)
---
### BABX (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result Down / Strength

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is bullish. Despite the monthly Supply Dominance warning, the recent weekly action is positive. The week of 2026-01-12 showed a huge spread up, but closed near the middle (CLV -0.06), signaling Effort No Result Up, likely meeting supply. However, the last two weeks have shown resilience. The final week (2026-01-26) was an up-close (0.53 CLV) on below-average volume (RelVol 0.59). The price successfully held above the $46 support, and the moderate volume rally suggests that supply has been absorbed, and demand is quietly taking charge.

**Key Levels:** 53.35 (Recent High/Supply), 46.36 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $51.45 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** $46.36 (Last low, break suggests deep test failure)
---
### BAH (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Reversal

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly chart flagged a Buying Climax Watch. The weekly chart confirms strong selling. The weeks of 2026-01-05 and 2026-01-19 showed strong upward movements and new highs, suggesting heavy professional involvement. However, the last candle (2026-01-26) was a massive reversal: wide spread down (Spread 14.6), closing near the low (-0.62 CLV) on the highest volume of the past five weeks (RelVol 1.28). This signifies a clear Buying Climax top and the immediate start of distribution/markdown.

**Key Levels:** 109.10 (Buying Climax High), 88.36 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $88.36 on follow-through volume.
- **Invalidation:** $103.00 (High of the last weak rally)
---
### BE (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Test of Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is bullish. The monthly chart shows Stopping Volume Watch near the low $88 area. The weekly chart shows tremendous strength, with three consecutive high-CLV, wide-spread, high-volume weeks (2026-01-05, 2026-01-12, 2026-01-26). Although the 2026-01-19 candle showed some supply entering (down-close, Effort No Result), the last week (2026-01-26) was a strong up-close (0.86 CLV) on low volume (RelVol 0.52). This low-volume surge, after a minor setback, suggests the supply has been tested and absorbed, signaling renewed bullish conviction. This action potentially confirms the bullish continuation despite the high volatility.

**Key Levels:** 167.57 (New High/Target), 136.25 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $167.57 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** $142.00 (Last open/support area)
---
### BEP (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Demand Confirmation / No Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
Despite the monthly chart flagging confirmed Supply Dominance, the weekly action is signaling a reversal. The 2026-01-05 candle showed a wide spread down, closing near the low (-0.78 CLV), indicating selling pressure. However, the next three weeks were positive. The last week (2026-01-26) was an up-close (0.68 CLV) on very low volume (RelVol 0.51). This low-volume rally suggests a lack of overhead supply (No Supply) and confirms demand is in control after clearing recent supply barriers, indicating a possible change of character against the monthly trend.

**Key Levels:** 29.15 (Recent High/Target), 28.21 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $29.15 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** $28.21 (Low of the accumulation pattern)
---
### BHF (NEUTRAL to BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply / Consolidation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is bearish, but the recent price action is extremely quiet. The last five weeks show very tight spreads and low volume (RelVol mostly below 0.6), suggesting institutional indecision or quiet accumulation. The last candle (2026-01-26) was an up-close (0.72 CLV) on the lowest volume of the past five weeks (RelVol 0.22). This is a strong 'No Supply' signal, suggesting selling pressure is exhausted and the path of least resistance is up. This may be accumulation forming at the monthly Buying Climax support area.

**Key Levels:** 65.00 (Resistance/Range High), 64.00 (Immediate Support/Range Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $64.41 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** $64.00 (Break below signals range continuation/weakness)

### BKSY (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result Down / Strength Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
Despite the monthly Buying Climax warning, the weekly chart remains strong. The 2026-01-12 candle saw high volume (RelVol 0.92) but closed mid-range (CLV 0.18), indicating supply entering. However, subsequent selling attempts failed. The 2026-01-19 candle recovered (CLV 0.14). The final week (2026-01-26) was a strong up-close (0.73 CLV) on average volume (RelVol 0.5), indicating demand overcame the preceding weakness. The market is consolidating strength near the highs, suggesting accumulation following the high volume pullback in mid-January.

**Key Levels:** 29.79 (Recent High), 24.03 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $28.30 (prior high) on volume.
- **Invalidation:** $26.50 (Last open/support area)
---
### CAI (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Confirmed Early) / Demand Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly chart confirmed early Stopping Volume on 2026-01-12 (high volume down-close, followed by no immediate follow-through). The market has bounced back. The last candle (2026-01-26) was a narrow spread up-close (0.69 CLV) on low volume (RelVol 0.79). This action, following the high volume pullback, suggests supply has been absorbed, and the low volume test of the support area around $24.70 was successful. This indicates a likely entry into a markup phase, overriding the bearish quarterly trend temporarily.

**Key Levels:** 29.32 (Supply High), 24.58 (Stopping Volume Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $26.85 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** $24.58 (Break below invalidates accumulation)
---
### CNQ (BULLISH (Continuation))
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Confirmed Early)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence shows clear Stopping Volume around 2026-01-05 (high volume, 2.05 RelVol, wide spread, closing near the middle CLV 0.35) after a downward move from 34.46 to 30.13. This bar confirmed Smart Money entry. The subsequent two weeks saw strong follow-through (2026-01-12 & 2026-01-19) on solid volume, resulting in high CLV closures. The last week (2026-01-26) was a narrow spread up bar closing near the high (CLV 0.99) on low relative volume (0.53 RelVol), indicating No Supply/Lack of selling pressure after the rally. The trend is strongly bullish.

**Key Levels:** 37.11 (Recent high/Resistance), 35.64 (Immediate support), 30.13 (Stopping Volume low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Breakout above 37.11 (confirmation of demand) or a minor pullback to 36.40 on low volume.
- **Invalidation:** Below 35.64 (Suggests a deeper test is needed)
---
### CORT (BULLISH (Potential Mark Up))
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Confirmed Early)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly context is bearish (Supply Dominance), but the weekly action is turning. The massive move down into 2025-12-29 was halted by Stopping Volume (30.3M volume, 5.58 RelVol, close near the low). Crucially, the subsequent bar (2026-01-05) showed rejection of the low (34.28) and accumulation. The 2026-01-19 bar was a massive upthrust (11.04 spread) on very high volume (12.9M), closing near the high (CLV 0.84), confirming strong demand and absorption of residual supply. This looks like a spring/re-accumulation setup following the climactic selling.

**Key Levels:** 47.06 (Recent high/Immediate target), 42.90 (Last week's low/Support), 33.79 (Stopping Volume base)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and hold above 47.06 or a low-volume Test/Pullback towards 42.90.
- **Invalidation:** Below 42.90 (Invalidates recent demand strength)
---
### CSGP (BEARISH (Distribution ongoing))
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly context is bearish. The monthly bar shows Stopping Volume, but the weekly sequence suggests persistent supply. The last bar (2026-01-26) is a wide spread down bar, closing near the low (CLV -0.98), on above-average volume (1.23 RelVol). This is a strong sign of weakness (Supply Dominance/Effort Down Result Down), potentially negating the demand seen in the preceding 2026-01-12 bar. Smart Money is distributing at these levels. The immediate support zone around 65.00 has been shattered.

**Key Levels:** 70.57 (Resistance/Recent high), 65.15 (Broken support/New resistance), 57.01 (Stopping Volume low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on confirmation of weakness, such as a low-volume minor rally failing near 65.95, targeting 58.00.
- **Invalidation:** Above 67.80 (Invalidates immediate distribution pressure)
---
### CTRA (BEARISH (Expecting Distribution))
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Confirmed Strong)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence confirmed a Buying Climax on 2026-01-12 (87.3M volume, 2.07 RelVol, wide spread, poor close CLV -0.46). This high volume/lack of follow-through signals Smart Money selling into strength. The subsequent week (2026-01-19) was a strong upthrust, but the last week (2026-01-26) was a narrow spread up bar on very low volume (0.42 RelVol). While the close was high (CLV 0.60), the lack of volume suggests the buying power is exhausted and the supply from the climax event is ready to take over. This is a very weak response to the high 27.99.

**Key Levels:** 28.48 (Buying Climax peak), 27.00 (Immediate Support), 24.68 (Climactic low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on a break below 27.00 on increasing volume, targeting the low of the climax bar.
- **Invalidation:** Above 27.99 (New high negates immediate climax thesis)
---
### CVS (BEARISH (Major Weakness))
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly context is bearish. The last weekly bar (2026-01-26) shows extreme weakness. It's a massive wide spread down bar (Spread 13.31) on very high volume (1.83 RelVol), closing near the middle (CLV -0.50). This indicates heavy selling pressure where supply easily overwhelmed any fleeting demand, pushing the price sharply lower towards the 70.69 low. The monthly CLV is also extremely negative (-0.49), confirming macro weakness. This is a potential markdown signal.

**Key Levels:** 84.00 (Recent high/Resistance), 70.69 (Major support level/Climactic low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on any low volume rally back toward 78.00, or a confirmed break below 70.69 (if selling continues).
- **Invalidation:** Above 82.61 (Invalidates immediate breakdown structure)
---
### DUOL (BEARISH (Strong Continuation))
**VSA Status:** Major Weakness/Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is bearish, reinforced by the monthly chart showing extreme weakness (CLV -0.97). The last weekly bar (2026-01-26) is a wide spread down bar on low volume (0.57 RelVol), closing near the absolute low (CLV -0.93). This is a textbook sign of severe weakness and markdown continuation (Effort Down, Result Down, Low Volume indicates no hidden demand). Smart Money is likely pressing the short side, anticipating further downside.

**Key Levels:** 155.89 (Immediate resistance), 142.31 (Recent low/Immediate target), 170.10 (Broken support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on a confirmed break below 142.31 or a low volume rally failing near 150.00.
- **Invalidation:** Above 155.89 (If price recovers this high on volume, weakness may be absorbed)
---
### ENR (BULLISH (Potential Mark Up))
**VSA Status:** Demand Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is bullish. The price structure shows demand entering forcefully on 2026-01-05 (wide spread, high volume, closing near high CLV 0.99), signaling absorption. The following two weeks tested this demand, specifically 2026-01-19 showing weakness (down bar, low volume, low CLV -0.69) but failing to significantly fall. The last bar (2026-01-26) is a strong up bar closing near the middle (CLV 0.08) on below-average volume (0.76 RelVol), indicating effortless demand. This confirms Smart Money control is tightening following the earlier demand signal.

**Key Levels:** 22.11 (Recent resistance), 19.81 (Immediate support/Spring level)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry on a break above 22.11 on increasing volume, confirming the shift in control.
- **Invalidation:** Below 19.81 (Invalidates spring action)
---
### FISV (BEARISH (Weakness))
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly context is bearish and the monthly shows Supply Dominance. The last two weekly bars show clear distribution signals. 2026-01-12 was a wide spread down bar on very high volume (1.42 RelVol), closing near the low (CLV -0.82), confirming heavy supply. The last bar (2026-01-26) continued the theme, being a wide spread down bar, closing near the low (CLV -0.80) on below-average volume (0.65 RelVol). This suggests supply is effortless and persistent, confirming distribution is ongoing.

**Key Levels:** 70.41 (Resistance), 64.62 (Immediate support), 67.91 (Pivot point)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on break below 64.62 or failure of a low volume rally near 67.50.
- **Invalidation:** Above 67.63 (Invalidates immediate weakness)
---
### FRPT (BULLISH (Mark Up Continuation))
**VSA Status:** Demand Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is bullish, reinforced by the monthly Stopping Volume signal. The 2026-01-19 bar was a massive wide spread up bar on strong volume (1.01 RelVol), closing near the high (CLV 0.69), signaling overwhelming demand. The last bar (2026-01-26) was a narrow spread up bar on low volume (0.60 RelVol), opening high and closing near the middle (CLV 0.0). This signifies 'No Supply' or low selling pressure following the major demand push, confirming the path of least resistance is up. The volume decreased after the demand surge, which is healthy.

**Key Levels:** 73.19 (Recent high/Resistance), 69.81 (Immediate support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry on break above 73.19 on strong volume, or a pullback to 71.50 (low volume test of demand).
- **Invalidation:** Below 69.81 (Suggests breakdown of recent demand structure)
---
### GE (BEARISH (Strong Distribution))
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly context is bearish. The 2026-01-19 bar was a massive wide spread down bar (Spread 33.81) on extremely high volume (1.97 RelVol), closing near the low (CLV -0.78). This is an undeniable sign of Effort Down Result Down, confirming heavy institutional selling (Distribution). The last bar (2026-01-26) was a narrow spread down bar on above-average volume (1.05 RelVol), closing near the low (CLV -0.60). This weakness persists. The strong effort down suggests Smart Money is driving the price lower.

**Key Levels:** 323.88 (Resistance), 290.07 (Recent low/Immediate target)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on failure to rally, preferably if a low volume rally fails near 300.00.
- **Invalidation:** Above 316.36 (Invalidates immediate weakness/Suggests absorption)
---
### GWRE (BEARISH (Markdown Continuation))
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Confirmed Early)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is bearish. Supply dominance was confirmed on 2026-01-12 with a massive wide spread down bar (Spread 26.27) on very high volume (1.95 RelVol), closing near the low (CLV -0.98). This is textbook Smart Money distribution and markdown initiation. The subsequent rally (2026-01-19) was on high volume (1.63 RelVol) but only managed to close mid-range (CLV 0.74), suggesting supply absorption/re-distribution. The last bar (2026-01-26) was a tight up bar on low volume (0.70 RelVol). This shows weak follow-through, likely preparing for the next leg down.

**Key Levels:** 163.46 (Immediate resistance), 158.80 (Re-distribution support), 154.51 (Recent low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on a failure to break 163.46, or a confirmed break below 158.80 on volume.

---
### HDB (BEARISH (Persistent Supply))
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is bearish. The 2026-01-05 bar was a wide spread down bar on extremely high volume (2.88 RelVol), closing near the low (CLV -0.91). This is a clear supply climax/markdown signal. While volume dropped significantly afterward (0.88 RelVol last week), the price movement remains tight and biased downwards (CLV -0.13), indicating persistent weakness and lack of demand. The monthly CLV is also heavily negative (-0.64).

**Key Levels:** 32.97 (Climactic low/Support), 36.73 (Resistance/Prior pivot)

#### Action Plan

---
### HPE (BULLISH (Confirmed Accumulation))
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Confirmed Early)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is bearish, but the monthly signal is Stopping Volume. The 2026-01-05 bar was a large down bar on high volume (0.80 RelVol, high volume for this ticker), but the volume diminished the following week (2026-01-12, 0.52 RelVol, narrow bar, low close CLV -0.97), suggesting supply exhaustion/absorption around 21.42. The 2026-01-19 bar was a spring/test (low volume, up close, CLV 0.05). The last bar (2026-01-26) was a narrow spread up bar, closing high (CLV 0.53) on very low volume (0.28 RelVol). This is strong No Supply confirmation, indicating Smart Money has absorbed the selling.

### INVH (BULLISH (Accumulation))
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Confirmed Early)

The market tested this low immediately (2026-01-12), resulting in a wide spread up bar closing near the high (CLV 0.99), which is a high-quality confirmation of demand. The last two weeks saw pullback/re-accumulation attempts on declining volume (0.51 RelVol last week, down bar, low close CLV -0.87), which is a minor weakness but expected in a Wyckoff accumulation zone (potential secondary test).

**Key Levels:** 28.34 (Resistance), 26.13 (Immediate support/Test level), 25.29 (Climactic low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Long entry on a break and hold above 27.00, or confirmation of a strong up bar from 26.13 on high volume (Confirmation of demand).

### KVYO (BULLISH (Accumulation confirmed))
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Confirmed Early)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is bearish, but the market shows clear signs of reversal. The 2026-01-12 bar was a massive wide spread down bar, closing near the low (CLV -0.97), but importantly, it occurred on high volume (1.03 RelVol) and pushed into the climactic range. The subsequent bar (2026-01-19) was a strong up bar closing in the middle-high (CLV 0.40) on average volume, rejecting the low 23.00 (Spring action). The last bar (2026-01-26) was a narrow spread up bar, closing mid-range (CLV 0.20) on very low volume (0.38 RelVol).

### LHX (BEARISH (Potential Distribution))
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Confirmed Early)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is bullish. The sequence shows a major push higher (2026-01-05) on extreme volume (1.87 RelVol, CLV 0.84). This was immediately followed by a wide spread up bar (2026-01-12) on high volume (2.09 RelVol), which closed significantly off the high (CLV -0.05). This is a strong Buying Climax/Upthrust signal, indicating Smart Money selling into the strength. The subsequent two weeks saw tight, low-volume action, with the last bar (2026-01-26) closing high (CLV 0.61) on low volume (0.65 RelVol).

**VSA Status:** No Supply (Low volume pullback)

**Smart Money Logic:**

---
### RF (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply (Demand confirmed by low volume pullback)

**Smart Money Logic:**
RF pulled back significantly (W2-W4) after hitting supply. W5 is a very narrow spread up bar on exceptionally low volume (RelVol 0.38), closing strongly off the lows. This indicates that supply has dried up, validating a 'No Supply' setup in a bullish quarterly context.

RGTI failed its attempted rally (W2/W3) and resumed weakness (W4). W5 printed a medium spread down bar on extremely low volume (RelVol 0.26), closing poorly. This clear lack of buying interest (No Demand) confirms that supply has control and further markdown is likely.

**Key Levels:** Resistance 23.78, Immediate Support 21.39

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Breakdown below 21.39.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 23.78
---
### RLI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Confirmed Weakness / Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
RLI is confirming its bearish sequence. W4 showed high volume selling, and W5 followed through with a down bar closing virtually on the lows (CLV -0.97). This confirms persistent supply pressure and accelerated markdown.

**Key Levels:** Resistance 59.45, Immediate Support 55.79

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 56.95 (W5 Close).
- **Invalidation:** Close above 59.45
---
### RVMD (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Demand Reassertion

**Smart Money Logic:**
Following a major Buying Climax (W2) and subsequent markdown, W5 experienced a massive wide spread down bar on high volume, but closed significantly off the low (92.50 to 97.33). This resilience, coupled with high volume, signals large-scale institutional demand stepping in (Stopping Volume).

**Key Levels:** Demand Zone 92.50, Resistance 101.93

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Successful Test of 92.50 area, or clear break above 98.00.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 92.50
---
### SARO (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Confirmed Supply / Change of Character (Distribution)

**Smart Money Logic:**
W4 showed a massive Buying Climax (RelVol 3.72) with a very poor close, signaling distribution. W5 immediately followed with high volume selling, closing on the lows (CLV -0.94). This sequence confirms that supply is now dominant and a markdown phase has begun.

**Key Levels:** Distribution Area 34.47, Immediate Resistance 32.99

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Breakdown below W5 low (31.54) on confirming volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 33.45
---
### STAA (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Demand (Weakness continuation)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Following confirmed weakness in W4 (down bar closing on lows), W5 is an extremely narrow, low-volume bar closing poorly. This 'No Demand' signal indicates buyers are completely absent, making the price highly vulnerable to further declines in the confirmed bearish trend.

**Key Levels:** Resistance 19.65, Support 18.80

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Breakdown below 18.80.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 19.65
---
### SYF (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Confirmed Weakness / Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly chart confirms severe supply dominance. W4 and W5 show active markdown, with W5 printing a wide spread down bar on high volume (RelVol 1.42), closing near lows. This confirms that supply entered forcefully following the W3 shakeout, and the downtrend is accelerating.

**Key Levels:** Resistance 77.57, Immediate Support 72.11

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Breakdown below 72.11.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 77.57
---
### TRU (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Demand (Weakness continuation / Test Initiation)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The short-term rally (W2/W3) was rejected by supply (W4). W5 is a wide spread down bar on low volume (RelVol 0.49), closing poorly. This No Demand signal confirms the failure of the prior rally and suggests a swift continuation towards testing the main support zone around 80.20.

**Key Levels:** Resistance 85.13, Support 80.20

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Breakdown below 80.20.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 85.13
---
### UNH (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Confirmed Supply / Change of Character (Distribution)

**Smart Money Logic:**
W4 was an aggressive demand bar, but W5 delivered a decisive reversal with massive spread and climactic volume (RelVol 2.44), closing deep in the range. This constitutes a clear Change of Character, confirming aggressive distribution and the likely continuation of the major bearish trend.

**Key Levels:** Resistance 354.79, Immediate Support 280.39

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Breakdown below W5 low (280.39).
- **Invalidation:** Close above 354.79
---
### VONG (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply (Demand confirmed by low volume pullback)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Following aggressive supply (W3) and strong demand response (W4), W5 is a narrow spread up bar on extremely low volume (RelVol 0.41). This confirms that selling pressure has dried up (No Supply), supporting the monthly Stopping Volume scenario and setting up a test of overhead resistance.

**Key Levels:** Demand Zone 120.55, Resistance 123.18

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 121.79 (W5 close) or 122.00 psychological level.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 120.55
---
### WRB (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result / Confirmed Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
WRB attempted a rally in W5 (wide spread up) but failed to hold its gains, closing near the middle/low (CLV 0.08). This classic 'Effort No Result' indicates strong overhead supply absorbing all demand, reinforcing the overall bearish trend continuation.

**Key Levels:** Resistance 69.91, Support 65.01

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Breakdown below 67.00.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 69.91
---
## 👀 Watch/Monitoring
### ABT (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly chart shows a strong Supply Dominance signal, confirmed by the wide spread and high volume (RelVol 2.57) on the 2026-01-19 candle, closing near the low, indicating strong selling pressure. The following week (2026-01-26) tried to rally on slightly above-average volume (RelVol 1.5), but the spread was tighter and closed weak (-0.69 CLV), suggesting secondary selling (Weak Rally/Effort No Result). The monthly chart also closed near its low on high volume (RelVol 1.54), confirming the current strong bearish sentiment.

**Key Levels:** 125.76 (Previous Resistance/Supply), 105.27 (Recent Low/Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $105.27 (Weekly Low) on high volume.
- **Invalidation:** $110.40 (High of recent weak rally)
---
### ABVX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Effort vs. Result

**Smart Money Logic:**
The automated detection points to a confirmed early Buying Climax. While the weekly chart shows recent volatility, the last two weeks are highly bearish. The 2026-01-19 candle showed a wide spread up on average volume, but the most recent week (2026-01-26) saw a wide spread down on very low volume (RelVol 0.40), closing near the low (-0.83 CLV). This suggests underlying weakness and failure to hold the prior rally's gains, which may indicate Smart Money distribution in the prior high-volume period (30M+ volume weeks). The low volume down-week implies lack of buying interest/demand.

**Key Levels:** 125.00 (Recent High), 112.98 (Recent Low Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $112.98 (Weekly Low) on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** $125.00 (Last high, confirming failure)
---
### ACLX (NEUTRAL to BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result / Weakness

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is bullish, but the recent weekly action shows selling pressure despite attempts to move higher. The week of 2026-01-19 had a huge spread (10.5) but closed weakly (-0.67 CLV) on high volume (RelVol 1.51), indicating significant supply entering the market (Effort No Result Up). The last weekly candle (2026-01-26) showed a minor spread up-close on low volume (RelVol 0.61), failing to follow through. This is an immediate sign of weakness against the monthly Supply Dominance context.

**Key Levels:** 76.50 (Recent High/Supply), 66.00 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $66.55 (Low of 2026-01-26) with follow-through volume.
- **Invalidation:** $70.11 (Previous week's high)
---
### ACN (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Monthly) / Weakness (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly chart suggests Stopping Volume is present, indicating possible accumulation starting near the lows of the previous month. However, the last weekly bar (2026-01-26) showed a wide spread down, closing near its low (-0.69 CLV) on low volume (RelVol 0.47). This low volume selling suggests that while selling might be exhausting (Stopping Volume stage), institutional demand hasn't visibly taken control yet. The movement is counter to the overall bullish quarterly trend, indicating a significant pullback or possible short-term distribution area around $280-$290.

**Key Levels:** 291.09 (High Resistance), 267.86 (Recent Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a low-volume 'Test' of the $267.86 area and a strong up-close confirmation.
- **Invalidation:** $267.86 (Break below suggests deeper correction)
---
### AGIO (NEUTRAL to BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Demand / Low Volume Weakness

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly chart registered Stopping Volume near the lows, suggesting preliminary support. However, the most recent weekly action is unconvincing. After a bullish Effort Up (2026-01-19, high CLV, average volume), the last week (2026-01-26) showed a down move, closing near the low (-0.70 CLV) on very low volume (RelVol 0.54). This implies that the prior buying effort was not backed by sustained demand, and the lack of volume on the down move is typical of a minor pullback or a lack of institutional interest (No Demand).

**Key Levels:** 29.93 (Recent High), 27.11 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $28.03 on follow-through volume, or a successful low-volume Test of $27.11.
- **Invalidation:** $29.93 (Reversal high)
---
### AIQ (NEUTRAL to BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Monthly) / Climax Run-up (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly chart detected Stopping Volume, suggesting accumulation support. The weekly chart shows strong bullish momentum up until the last week. The 2026-01-19 candle was a wide spread up, closing very high (0.80 CLV) on high volume (RelVol 0.9). However, the last week (2026-01-26) saw a smaller spread up-close (0.59 CLV) but on very low relative volume (RelVol 0.38). This low volume up-move at the high end of the recent rally suggests potential Buying Climax or lack of sustained institutional interest following the surge, but the overall close remains positive. Need a clear test or confirmation of demand.

**Key Levels:** 53.94 (Recent High), 52.31 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $53.94 on above-average volume.
- **Invalidation:** $52.31 (Break below suggests distribution)
---
### ALC (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Monthly) / No Demand (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly chart shows a confirmed early Stopping Volume signal, indicating potential accumulation off the lows. The last weekly bar (2026-01-26) was an up-close, tight spread, but on very low volume (RelVol 0.31). This low volume up-close suggests a lack of institutional buying conviction at this stage (No Demand). Given the overall bullish quarterly trend and the Stopping Volume context, this current action looks like a low-volume 'test' before a potential markup phase, but accumulation is not fully confirmed yet.

**Key Levels:** 82.50 (Recent High/Supply), 79.81 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Successful low-volume Test near $79.81 followed by a wide spread up candle.
- **Invalidation:** $79.81 (Break below invalidates immediate accumulation)
---
### AMBA (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result Down / No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
The market is showing clear weakness. The 2026-01-05 candle was a wide spread down, closing near the low (-0.88 CLV) on very high volume (RelVol 1.81), indicating strong supply overwhelming demand. The subsequent week (2026-01-12) tried to rally on high volume but failed to make progress (Effort No Result). The last week (2026-01-26) was a tight spread down, closing near the low (-0.67 CLV) on extremely low volume (RelVol 0.34). This low-volume weakness suggests No Demand and confirms the sustained bearish context set by the earlier Supply Dominance signal.

**Key Levels:** 81.35 (Supply High), 64.00 (Recent Low Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $66.24 (low of 2026-01-26) on volume.
- **Invalidation:** $70.77 (High of the last rally attempt)
---
### AMH (NEUTRAL to BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Monthly) / Supply Follow-through

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly chart confirmed a Stopping Volume phase (2026-01-05 high volume down candle, followed by a strong recovery on 2026-01-12). However, the last week (2026-01-26) was a wide spread down, closing at the absolute low (-0.89 CLV) on average volume (RelVol 0.62). This strong selling into the close, following the potential accumulation attempt, suggests that Smart Money is either re-distributing or that the stopping action failed. The failure of the price to hold gains indicates supply is still dominating the short term.

**Key Levels:** 32.65 (Recent High), 30.72 (Stopping Volume Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $30.72 (Stopping Volume low) on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** $32.12 (High of 2026-01-26 candle)
---
### ARWR (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly chart shows a confirmed early Supply Dominance. The 2026-01-05 candle was a wide spread down, closing near the middle (-0.51 CLV) on massive volume (RelVol 2.19), indicating heavy supply. Subsequent rallies failed to breach the high of this candle. The last week (2026-01-26) was a narrow spread down, closing near the low (-0.93 CLV) on extremely low volume (RelVol 0.35). This low-volume down-close confirms a lack of institutional demand (No Demand) and indicates that the prior supply remains dominant, likely leading to a markdown.

**Key Levels:** 76.76 (Supply High), 65.48 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $65.48 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** $68.80 (High of the last No Demand candle)
---
### AS (NEUTRAL to BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Weakness/Effort No Result Down

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly context is Supply Dominance (Watch for Test). The weekly action is mixed. The 2026-01-19 candle was a strong up-close (0.98 CLV) on high volume, suggesting demand, but it failed to follow through. The last weekly candle (2026-01-26) was a down-move, closing near the low (-0.65 CLV) on low volume (RelVol 0.51). The lack of strong demand following the prior week's high-CLV close, coupled with the immediate weak reaction on low volume, suggests selling pressure is absorbing buying. The overall inability to sustain the rally points to weakness.

**Key Levels:** 38.91 (Recent High), 36.84 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $36.84 on increased volume.
- **Invalidation:** $38.91 (Last high)
---
### AZN (NEUTRAL to BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Weekly) / Weakness

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly chart on 2026-01-12 showed a massive volume spike (RelVol 3.3) on a wide spread that closed mid-range, suggesting Stopping Volume at a resistance area. The subsequent week (2026-01-19) was a low-volume test, closing strongly up (0.97 CLV), but the last week (2026-01-26) was a wide spread down, closing near the low (-0.80 CLV) on average volume (RelVol 0.73). This failure to follow through after the bullish 'Test' signals underlying weakness and potential failure of the Stopping Volume to initiate a robust markup. Supply reasserted control.

**Key Levels:** 96.51 (Recent High/Supply), 92.90 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $92.90 on follow-through volume.
- **Invalidation:** $96.18 (High of the last weak rally)
---
### BANC (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Monthly) / Effort No Result Down (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly chart confirmed a strong Buying Climax, indicating significant long-term supply has entered the market. The weekly chart shows immediate weakness. The 2026-01-19 candle was a wide spread down, closing near the absolute low (-0.96 CLV) on high volume (RelVol 0.97), a clear supply signal. The final week (2026-01-26) attempted to rebound (up-close) on narrow spread and very low volume (RelVol 0.38). This low volume reaction suggests a 'No Demand' rally into the established supply. While the overall trend is bullish, the short-term distribution signals are strong.

**Key Levels:** 21.61 (Climax High), 19.67 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $19.67 (Low of 2026-01-26) on volume.
- **Invalidation:** $20.41 (High of the last No Demand rally)
---
### BBIO (NEUTRAL to BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Confirmed Early) / Weakness

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly chart previously signaled Stopping Volume (Accumulation) near $71-$73 (2026-01-12). However, the last weekly candle (2026-01-26) was a down-close on high volume (RelVol 0.62) relative to recent action, closing near the low (-0.15 CLV). This negative close, particularly on volume following a supposed accumulation, suggests that supply may still be present, or the accumulation phase is failing to hold above the support area. The lack of a confirmed rally implies Smart Money is not ready to push price higher yet.

**Key Levels:** 79.88 (Supply High), 75.83 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $75.83 on volume, indicating failure.
- **Invalidation:** $79.76 (High of the last rally attempt)
---
### BBT (NEUTRAL to BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result Down / No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly chart flagged a Buying Climax, suggesting distribution. The weekly action shows lack of persistent demand. The 2026-01-19 candle was a wide spread up, but closed mid-range (CLV -0.04) on high volume (RelVol 0.75), indicating Effort No Result Up (meeting supply). The last week (2026-01-26) was a down-close on low volume (RelVol 0.48), closing near the low (-0.05 CLV). This confirms the lack of follow-through buying and suggests the market is vulnerable to supply, aligning with the monthly distribution context.

**Key Levels:** 29.63 (Supply High), 27.71 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $27.71 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** $28.70 (High of the last weak rally)
---
### BBWI (NEUTRAL to BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Monthly) / Lack of Demand (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly chart confirmed early Supply Dominance. The weekly price action is showing weakness near the top of the range. The 2026-01-19 candle was a down-close, wide spread, on average volume. The final week (2026-01-26) was also a down-close on a narrow spread, but the CLV was slightly positive (0.06), occurring on low volume (RelVol 0.36). While the CLV is positive, the overall low volume suggests institutional buyers are stepping back (No Demand) following the prior selling pressure. The consolidation appears weak and vulnerable within the monthly bearish context.

**Key Levels:** 23.73 (Recent High), 21.08 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $21.08 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** $22.11 (High of the last weak rally)
---
### BNS (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly chart confirms Supply Dominance. The 2026-01-05 candle was a strong down-move on high volume (RelVol 1.88), closing near the low. Although there was a brief recovery (2026-01-12, 2026-01-19), the rally was weak and on diminishing volume. The final candle (2026-01-26) showed a wide spread down, closing near the low (-0.39 CLV) on low volume (RelVol 0.53). This combination of a weak up-move followed by a down-close on low volume confirms a lack of institutional demand (No Demand) and validates the original supply signal, suggesting markdown continuation.

**Key Levels:** 76.50 (Supply High), 74.72 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $74.72 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** $76.50 (Last high)
---
### BP (NEUTRAL to BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Confirmed Strong) / No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly chart signaled confirmed strong Supply Dominance on 2026-01-05 (wide spread down, high volume RelVol 1.85). Although price moved higher since then, it failed to surpass the high of the Supply candle ($36.23) until the most recent week. The 2026-01-26 candle was a wide spread up, closing high (0.71 CLV), but on low volume (RelVol 0.52). This high-CLV close on low volume suggests the price is rising in the absence of significant supply, but crucially, also without significant demand (No Demand). This is a weak up-move that often precedes a reaction back down, especially following major supply.

**Key Levels:** 37.90 (Recent High), 36.46 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on failure to break $37.90, or break below $36.46.
- **Invalidation:** $37.90 (Requires clear high volume breakout above)
---
### BRKR (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax / Failure to Rally

**Smart Money Logic:**
Despite the monthly Stopping Volume context, the weekly chart action is dominated by supply. The 2026-01-12 candle was a wide spread down, closing near the low (-0.86 CLV) on the highest volume in the series (RelVol 1.06), signaling a Selling Climax. The subsequent rally attempt (2026-01-19) was weak (mid-close, low volume). The final week (2026-01-26) was another wide spread down, closing near the low (-0.75 CLV) on low volume (RelVol 0.45). The failure to mount a recovery after the selling climax suggests that the area $46-$47 is not holding as accumulation, and markdown is likely to continue.

**Key Levels:** 56.22 (Supply High), 46.00 (Selling Climax Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $46.00 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** $50.49 (High of the last weak rally)
---
### BSY (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Monthly) / Weak Rally

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly chart suggests Supply Dominance. The weekly chart shows consistent weakness. The 2026-01-12 candle was a down-close, closing near the low (-0.57 CLV) on high volume (RelVol 1.03), indicating persistent supply. The last weekly candle (2026-01-26) was a narrow spread down, closing near the low (-0.74 CLV) on low volume (RelVol 0.47). This low volume selling pressure, following a high-volume attempt to rally (2026-01-19), indicates a lack of demand and confirms the bearish setup, suggesting markdown continuation toward the quarterly low.

**Key Levels:** 40.66 (Supply High), 37.10 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $37.10 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** $39.07 (High of the last weak rally)
---
### BXSL (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result Down / No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly chart shows Supply Dominance, suggesting distribution is in play. The recent weekly action is extremely tight and low volume, indicating a quiet phase of the market. The last week (2026-01-26) was a narrow spread down, closing mid-range (-0.31 CLV) on very low volume (RelVol 0.59). This suggests a 'No Demand' scenario. Given the prior strong selling indicated by the monthly chart, the current low volume consolidation is vulnerable to a markdown. Needs clearer accumulation signals to reverse bearish view.

**Key Levels:** 27.07 (Resistance/Supply), 25.80 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $25.80 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** $26.50 (High of the last Test candle)
---
### CADE (NEUTRAL to BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Effort No Result Down

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly chart flagged a Buying Climax Watch. The weekly action confirms supply has entered. The 2026-01-19 candle was a wide spread down, closing near the absolute low (-0.98 CLV) on high volume (RelVol 1.13), indicating a strong supply wave (Selling Climax). The last week (2026-01-26) attempted a reaction rally, but closed down (-0.31 CLV) on low volume (RelVol 0.53). This confirms institutional demand is absent (No Demand), and the prior selling is likely to continue. The quarterly bullish trend is under immediate threat.

**Key Levels:** 46.74 (Climax High), 41.60 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $41.60 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** $43.40 (High of the last weak rally)
---
### CALM (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Effort No Result Down

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly chart confirms Supply Dominance. The 2026-01-05 candle was a wide spread down, closing near the low (-0.76 CLV) on high volume (RelVol 2.24). A strong rally attempt followed (2026-01-12) with high CLV. However, the market failed to sustain this strength. The last two weeks saw the price close down relative to the open, with the final week (2026-01-26) showing a wide spread up that closed mid-range/down (-0.19 CLV) on low volume (RelVol 0.79). This action, combined with the earlier strong supply signal, suggests the last two weeks were attempts at absorption that failed, indicating distribution is continuing.

**Key Levels:** 83.68 (Supply High), 79.85 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $79.85 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** $83.68 (Last high)
---
### CMPO (BULLISH (Anticipating Test))
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
The large weekly spread on 2026-01-12 accompanying extremely high volume (3.55x relative volume, 18.9M shares) resulted in a close near the high (CLV 0.71), indicating strong demand/Stopping Volume, even in the face of possible selling. The following two weeks saw reduced volume and successful absorption of supply. The last week (2026-01-26) was a narrow down bar on lower volume (RelVol 0.88), suggesting Smart Money is absorbing the final supply before a potential markdown. The quarterly trend is bullish, supporting accumulation efforts.

**Key Levels:** 20.15 (Low of absorption/Stopping Volume bar), 25.95 (High of Stopping Volume bar), 23.94 (Last week's low/Potential support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A low-volume Test of the 23.94 support level or a clear break above 25.32 (last week's high) on strength.
- **Invalidation:** Below 23.94 (Invalidates immediate bullish absorption structure)
---
### CNXC (NEUTRAL/WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar (2026-01-26) is a very wide spread down bar, closing near the absolute low (CLV -0.98), indicating significant selling pressure. However, the volume (0.64 RelVol) is below average, suggesting that while the demand disappeared dramatically, the selling effort itself wasn't overwhelmingly high. This bar looks like potential 'Effort No Result Down' if it had higher volume, but currently, it is extreme weakness in a short-term bullish move. The presence of stopping volume from 2026-01-12 (wide spread, high volume, high CLV 0.76) suggests Smart Money absorption occurred earlier, but this bar needs testing. We are watching for the test of the weakness created by the sharp drop.

**Key Levels:** 44.78 (Recent peak/Resistance), 36.26 (Last week's low/Immediate support), 37.85 (Prior accumulation low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A successful, low-volume Test of the 36.26 level, followed by strength, or a break above 40.00 on significant volume.
- **Invalidation:** Below 36.26 (Suggests mark down phase is commencing)
---
### CPNG (BEARISH (Testing Resistance))
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly and monthly trends are bearish (Supply Dominance). While the last bar (2026-01-26) was an up bar closing in the middle/high range (CLV 0.47) on high volume (1.86 RelVol), this volume spike is happening near the lows of the previous wide-spread down bar (2026-01-12, CLV -0.62), suggesting possible churning or initial absorption, but within a strong downtrend context. The overall price structure suggests supply is still dominating, pushing prices lower over several weeks.

**Key Levels:** 22.33 (Prior support/Current resistance), 18.55 (Recent low/Climactic level), 20.02 (Last open/Pivot)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on failure to hold 20.33, confirmed by heavy volume on the next down move, or long entry only after a clear No Supply test below 19.69.
- **Invalidation:** Above 21.14 (Invalidates immediate supply pressure)
---
### CRBG (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Neutral/Sideways

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly action is tight and low volume (0.37 RelVol last week, narrow spread). The monthly context shows a Buying Climax, suggesting distribution occurred earlier, but current weekly action is very tight consolidation near 30.00. This low volume suggests neither Smart Money demand nor supply is actively pushing the price. Waiting for accumulation or distribution to finish within this tight range.

**Key Levels:** 31.50 (Resistance/High of consolidation), 29.35 (Support/Low of consolidation)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Breakout above 31.50 on high volume (Bullish) or breakdown below 29.35 on high volume (Bearish).
- **Invalidation:** None (Requires break of range boundaries)
---
### DOW (NEUTRAL/WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result Down (Possible)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar (2026-01-26) is a down bar on relatively low volume (0.67 RelVol). Crucially, the spread is relatively narrow compared to the preceding weeks, and the bar closed near the middle/low (CLV -0.15). While the trend is bullish quarterly, the monthly chart shows Supply Dominance starting to enter (CLV 0.54). This last bar suggests weakness: sellers tried to push price lower but lacked the conviction of high volume. We look for a test. If the general market is bullish (SPY context), this could be a minor pullback before continuation.

**Key Levels:** 28.56 (Recent high/Resistance), 27.20 (Immediate support), 26.33 (Prior pivot low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Low volume Test of 27.20 or confirmed strength above 28.56 on high volume.
- **Invalidation:** Below 27.20 (Suggests a deeper correction toward 26.00)
---
### FER (NEUTRAL/WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is bullish, but the monthly signal is Supply Dominance. The last weekly bar (2026-01-26) is a strong upthrust reaching 69.81 on low volume (0.46 RelVol) but closing significantly off the high (CLV -0.09). This looks like an upthrust or rejection of higher prices on low conviction. The lack of selling volume in the last three weeks, combined with a rejection of the high, suggests distribution may be occurring quietly (Effort Up No Result).

**Key Levels:** 69.82 (Upthrust high/Resistance), 67.02 (Immediate support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 67.02 on high volume (Bearish) or a strong break above 69.82 on conviction (Bullish continuation).
- **Invalidation:** Above 69.82 (If breakout is confirmed)
---
### FFIV (BULLISH (Climactic Absorption))
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar (2026-01-26) saw a massive spread (42.13) on heavy volume (1.25 RelVol), closing well off the absolute high (CLV 0.45). This represents climactic action, likely stopping the prior short-term markdown. The bar opened at 261.87 and rallied dramatically to 303.98, signaling intense demand and absorption of supply. The monthly chart confirms stopping volume intent. The close below the absolute high suggests some high-level selling (Upthrust), but the overall volume and rally suggest dominant demand.

**Key Levels:** 303.98 (Climactic high/Resistance), 261.85 (Climactic low/Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Low volume Test of the 261.85-270.00 area (No Supply signal), or a clear breakout above 303.98.
- **Invalidation:** Below 261.85 (Invalidates accumulation structure)
---
### FIBK (NEUTRAL/WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly signal is a Buying Climax. The weekly action remains contained. The 2026-01-19 bar was a wide spread down bar (Spread 2.83) closing poorly (CLV -0.50), but on low volume (0.75 RelVol). The last week (2026-01-26) was tight, low volume (0.31 RelVol), closing near the middle (CLV -0.19). This indicates tight supply, but the prior climax signal suggests caution. We are consolidating after a major up move, indicating potential distribution/re-distribution.

**Key Levels:** 38.78 (Recent high/Climax resistance), 35.95 (Immediate support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Breakout above 38.78 on strong volume (Bullish) or breakdown below 35.95 on strong volume (Bearish).
- **Invalidation:** Below 35.95 (Confirms weakness)
---
### GBCI (NEUTRAL/WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Demand Confirmation/Upthrust

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is bullish, but the monthly is Supply Dominance. The 2026-01-19 bar saw a strong high of 50.92, but closed significantly off the high (CLV -0.32) on high volume (1.15 RelVol). This is a potential upthrust action, signaling short-term distribution/supply entering. The last week (2026-01-26) saw an attempt to rally, resulting in a narrow up bar closing in the middle (CLV 0.35) on low volume (0.66 RelVol). The mixed signals (bullish trend vs. recent upthrust/monthly weakness) make the position neutral. Requires a test of the upthrust area.

**Key Levels:** 50.92 (Upthrust high/Resistance), 47.32 (Immediate support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A definitive break above 50.92 on strong volume, or a failure/break below 47.32 signaling re-distribution.
- **Invalidation:** Below 47.32 (Confirms supply dominance)
---
### GKOS (NEUTRAL/WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is bullish, but the monthly signal is Buying Climax. The 2026-01-12 bar was a wide spread up bar on high volume (1.25 RelVol), closing near the high (CLV 0.90). This initial demand was negated the following week (2026-01-19) with a wide spread bar closing low (CLV -0.71) on average volume (0.89 RelVol), which is a clear sign of an Upthrust. The last bar (2026-01-26) was a tight up bar on low volume (0.55 RelVol), closing mid-range (CLV 0.20). This lack of follow-through confirms exhaustion after the climax/upthrust.

**Key Levels:** 130.23 (Upthrust high/Resistance), 116.73 (Immediate support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on break below 116.73 on strong volume, or Long entry only upon clearance of 130.23 on huge volume.
- **Invalidation:** Above 128.77 (If rally sustains volume)
---
### GNTX (BEARISH (Weakness))
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is bullish, but the monthly is Supply Dominance. The last week (2026-01-26) was a very narrow spread down bar on low volume (0.56 RelVol), closing near the low (CLV -0.49). This is a weak market showing inability to rally. The preceding week (2026-01-19) showed a down bar closing low (CLV -0.35). The consolidation is happening near the low of the preceding swing (23.35), indicating distribution pressure is persistent despite the general bullish context.

**Key Levels:** 24.00 (Immediate resistance), 23.42 (Immediate support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on a break below 23.42 on volume, or long entry only if volume increases rapidly above 24.00.
- **Invalidation:** Above 24.00 (Suggests immediate short pressure is off)
---
### HRMY (NEUTRAL/WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is bullish, but the monthly is Supply Dominance. The 2026-01-12 bar was a wide spread down bar on high volume (1.04 RelVol), closing near the low (CLV -0.35), indicating supply entering. This was followed by a low volume rally (2026-01-19, 0.58 RelVol). The last week (2026-01-26) was a narrow spread down bar on low volume (0.41 RelVol), closing near the low (CLV -0.60). The declining volume and general weakness suggest the market cannot sustain a rally, indicating potential re-distribution in the monthly trend context.

**Key Levels:** 39.40 (Resistance/Upthrust), 36.56 (Immediate support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 36.56 on volume (Bearish confirmation) or a clear No Supply test near 36.00 (Bullish reversal).
- **Invalidation:** Above 37.98 (Breach suggests immediate weakness is over)
---
### IMAX (NEUTRAL/WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is bearish, but the monthly indicates Stopping Volume. The 2026-01-12 bar was a wide spread up bar on high volume (1.22 RelVol), closing near the high (CLV 0.91), indicating strong demand/Stopping Volume. The market immediately tested this strength with a down bar the following week (2026-01-19) on low volume (0.75 RelVol), closing low (CLV -0.83). The last bar (2026-01-26) was tight and very low volume (0.30 RelVol), closing in the middle-low (CLV -0.41). This confirms supply is running low in the immediate vicinity of the Stopping Volume bar, suggesting accumulation may be finishing.

**Key Levels:** 37.61 (Resistance), 34.18 (Immediate support/Test level)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Long entry on a break above 37.61 on volume, or a low volume Test of 34.18 (No Supply).
- **Invalidation:** Below 34.18 (Invalidates absorption attempt)
---
### IONQ (NEUTRAL/WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is bearish, but the monthly shows a Buying Climax. The recent action shows churning near 45.00-50.00. The 2026-01-19 bar was a massive down bar (Spread 8.55) on average volume (0.70 RelVol), closing low (CLV -0.63). This is significant weakness/Upthrust after the strong rally in early January. The last bar (2026-01-26) was tight, closing mid-range (CLV -0.23) on average volume (0.67 RelVol). The overall low CLV sequence over the last 4 weeks suggests supply is heavy above 50.00.

**Key Levels:** 54.24 (Recent high/Resistance), 42.84 (Immediate support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 42.84 on high volume (Bearish markdown) or strong, high-volume demand above 50.00.
- **Invalidation:** Above 50.59 (Negates immediate supply pressure)
---
### ITT (NEUTRAL/WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is bearish, and the monthly shows Supply Dominance. The last bar (2026-01-26) was a wide spread down bar (Spread 7.74) on below-average volume (0.62 RelVol), closing in the middle-low (CLV -0.31). The drop was achieved without extreme volume, suggesting demand is weak. However, the range is contained between 178 and 185 over the last 4 weeks. The recent down move suggests weakness, but the pattern is consolidating around 180.00.

**Key Levels:** 185.82 (Resistance), 178.08 (Immediate support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on a confirmed break below 178.08 on volume, or Long entry only upon strength above 185.82.
- **Invalidation:** Above 183.75 (Suggests absorption of recent weakness)
---
### KDP (NEUTRAL/WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is bearish, and the monthly shows a Buying Climax. The recent action shows very tight ranges and low volume, indicating a compressed market. The last bar (2026-01-26) was a down bar, closing low (CLV -0.55) on extremely low volume (0.39 RelVol). This lack of effort (Volume) behind the drop suggests supply may be drying up, potentially setting up a spring or test of the climax structure (monthly CLV -0.68). This is an ambiguous position near short-term lows.

**Key Levels:** 27.78 (Resistance), 26.40 (Immediate support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 27.78 on strong volume (Bullish) or continued weakness and break below 26.40 (Bearish continuation).
- **Invalidation:** Below 26.40 (Confirms markdown)
---
### KEY (NEUTRAL/WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is bullish, but the monthly suggests Supply Dominance. The price is locked in a tight range (20.50 to 21.50) on low volume (0.53 RelVol last week). The last bar (2026-01-26) was a tight up bar closing mid-range (CLV 0.19). While the trend is bullish, the lack of directional conviction and the monthly supply signal suggest this could be re-distribution or simply low volume profit-taking. No immediate directional edge.

**Key Levels:** 21.48 (Resistance), 21.06 (Immediate support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Breakout above 21.48 on strength, or breakdown below 21.06 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** Below 20.17 (Invalidates bullish consolidation pattern)
---
### KYMR (NEUTRAL/WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is bullish, but the monthly suggests a Buying Climax. The 2026-01-12 bar was a wide spread down bar on average volume, closing near the low (CLV -0.96), confirming supply dominance after the recent high. The price is now consolidating between 68.28 and 73.60 on low volume (0.52 RelVol last week). The last bar (2026-01-26) was an up bar closing mid-range (CLV 0.08). The weakness from the climax hasn't been overcome, but the low volume suggests the price is struggling for direction in the consolidation area.

**Key Levels:** 77.93 (Climax high/Resistance), 68.28 (Immediate support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 73.60 on strong volume (Bullish) or confirmed break below 68.28 (Bearish).
- **Invalidation:** Below 68.28 (Confirms supply pressure)
---
### MOD (BULLISH (Accumulation Phase))
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Confirmed Early)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is bearish, but the market is showing reversal signs. The 2026-01-05 bar was a massive wide spread down bar on very high volume (2.84 RelVol), suggesting a Selling Climax/Stopping Volume (CLV -0.20). The subsequent two bars confirmed demand and rejection of the lows. The last bar (2026-01-26) was an up bar closing mid-range (CLV 0.06) on low volume (0.54 RelVol). The decreasing volume after the climax and subsequent price stability suggests accumulation is progressing well.

**Key Levels:** 153.66 (Resistance), 139.25 (Immediate support), 111.18 (Climactic low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Long entry on a definitive break above 150.75 on strong volume, or a low volume test of 145.00.
- **Invalidation:** Below 139.25 (Suggests accumulation has failed)
---
### MSFU (NEUTRAL/WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is bearish, and the monthly shows Supply Dominance. The last bar (2026-01-26) was a narrow spread up bar, closing near the high (CLV 0.84) on high volume (1.47 RelVol). This suggests a strong demand response, potentially stopping the prior weakness. However, the move is occurring after significant prior down bars (2026-01-12, 2026-01-19). This high volume up close signals demand, but given the bearish context, it could be a shakeout/rally before further markdown. Requires confirmation.

**Key Levels:** 40.96 (Recent high/Resistance), 37.47 (Immediate support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Long entry on confirmed follow-through above 40.96, or a short entry if the rally fails on low volume near 40.96.
- **Invalidation:** Below 37.47 (If weakness returns)
---
### NFXL (NEUTRAL/WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is bearish. The 2026-01-19 bar was a wide spread down bar on massive volume (3.34 RelVol), but it closed near the high/middle (CLV -0.006). This volume without a corresponding low close suggests strong Stopping Volume/initial demand. The last bar (2026-01-26) was a narrow spread down bar on below-average volume (1.05 RelVol), closing mid-range (CLV -0.50). This volume is declining relative to the climax, and the weak price action suggests supply is momentarily exhausted. Waiting for a clear test of demand.

**Key Levels:** 27.96 (Resistance), 24.24 (Immediate support/Test level)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Low volume Test of 24.24 (No Supply) followed by strength, or breakdown below 24.24 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** Below 24.24 (Invalidates potential accumulation)
---
### OC (NEUTRAL/WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is bullish. The monthly signals Stopping Volume. The last weekly bar (2026-01-26) was a wide spread down bar (Spread 5.29) on below-average volume (0.58 RelVol), closing near the low (CLV -0.79). This signals Effort Down Result Down. Given the prior weeks were strongly bullish (CLV 0.97, 0.47, 0.28), this single bar represents a significant shift in immediate control toward supply, likely confirming the monthly stopping volume event at the highs (potential Upthrust/Distribution).

**Key Levels:** 126.92 (Recent high/Resistance), 120.01 (Immediate support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on break below 120.01 on volume, or Long entry only if price quickly recovers and closes above 124.56.
- **Invalidation:** Above 125.30 (Negates supply dominance)
---
### OKLO (BEARISH (Potential Reversal))
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Confirmed Early)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is bullish, but the 2026-01-05 bar was a massive Buying Climax (97M volume, 1.18 RelVol, wide spread, CLV 0.41) followed by an Upthrust on 2026-01-12 (61.4M volume, 0.76 RelVol, low close CLV -0.38). This confirms distribution by Smart Money. Although the last bar (2026-01-26) was a strong up bar closing near the high (CLV 0.90) on very low volume (0.42 RelVol), this looks like a weak rally (No Demand) into the resistance zone created by the climax/upthrust, confirming the reversal threat.

**Key Levels:** 115.72 (Climax peak/Resistance), 86.18 (Immediate support/Test level)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on break below 86.18 on volume, confirming the markdown. Long entry only if 107.60 is cleared on high volume.
- **Invalidation:** Above 100.20 (Invalidates distribution thesis)
---
### ONB (NEUTRAL/WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Confirmed Strong)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is bullish, but the monthly confirmed Supply Dominance. The 2026-01-19 bar was a wide spread up bar on below-average volume (0.75 RelVol), closing low (CLV -0.29). This is Effort Up, No Result/Upthrust, showing hidden selling. The last bar (2026-01-26) was tight, closing mid-range (CLV -0.03) on very low volume (0.46 RelVol). The low volume and lack of follow-through after the Upthrust suggest weak demand. While the price held up, the underlying market conviction is low.

**Key Levels:** 24.78 (Upthrust high/Resistance), 23.37 (Immediate support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on break below 23.37 on volume, or a clear high volume breakout above 24.78 (negating distribution).
- **Invalidation:** Below 23.37 (Confirms markdown)
---
### PGY (NEUTRAL/WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is bearish, reinforced by the monthly Supply Dominance. The 2026-01-12 bar was a wide spread down bar on average volume (0.92 RelVol), closing near the low (CLV -0.93), signaling weakness. The last bar (2026-01-26) was a down bar, closing mid-range (CLV -0.40) on very low volume (0.47 RelVol). This suggests effortless selling, or possibly supply drying up near the lows. Given the bearish context, lack of demand is a concern, but the low volume prevents a strong directional call.

**Key Levels:** 22.29 (Immediate resistance), 20.55 (Immediate support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on break below 20.55 on volume (Bearish continuation) or a strong rally above 22.29 (Accumulation).
- **Invalidation:** Above 22.29 (Negates current weakness)
---
### PSN (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result / Supply Encountered

**Smart Money Logic:**
Price rallied strongly in January (W2/W3) overcoming short-term weakness. However, W4 showed a failure to close strong near highs (74.62), indicating supply absorption. W5 is a low volume pullback, which is constructive, but the previous supply signal means we must monitor for a successful test of demand.

**Key Levels:** Resistance 74.62, Support 69.18

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Bullish confirmation (Narrow spread up on low volume or Test of W5 low) above 72.00.
- **Invalidation:** Breakdown below 69.18
---
### QQQI (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Slowing Momentum / Minor Absorption

**Smart Money Logic:**
The bullish trend is intact (W4 confirmed demand), but W3 showed high volume churning. W5 continued upward but on significantly lower volume (RelVol 0.63), indicating slowing momentum near the highs (54.67). We await a strong breakout or a clear correction.

**Key Levels:** Resistance 54.67, Support 53.84

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 54.68 on confirming volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 53.35
---
### QTWO (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Confirmed Weakness / Supply Dominance Resumption

**Smart Money Logic:**
The rally attempt in W4 was immediately negated by W5, a wide spread down bar closing near lows (CLV -0.86). Despite low volume (RelVol 0.40), the bearish closing location reinforces the overall Supply Dominance trend, suggesting the markdown continues.

**Key Levels:** Resistance 69.36, Demand Area 63.43

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Breakdown below W5 low (64.77) on confirming volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 69.36
---
### RARE (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result / Supply Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
RARE experienced extreme volatility (Stopping Volume W1, Reaction W2/W3). W4 showed renewed demand, but W5 immediately stalled with a narrow range on low volume, closing poorly. This suggests persistent overhead supply around 25.00, requiring monitoring for distribution or re-accumulation.

**Key Levels:** Resistance 25.00, Strong Support 22.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 25.00 with increased volume for long; break below 24.09 for short.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 25.00 (Long) or below 22.00 (Short)
---
### RGLD (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Potential Blow-Off Warning (Slowing Momentum at Highs)

**Smart Money Logic:**
RGLD has surged vertically (W2-W4). W5 continued the wide spread up move but on significantly declining relative volume (0.56). This divergence between extreme price action and volume suggests diminishing buying force and high risk of reversal or major correction (Blow-Off/Climax Warning).

**Key Levels:** Immediate Resistance 302.52, Support 281.70

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Bearish confirmation (Wide spread down) below 299.00.
- **Invalidation:** Break above 302.52 (If considering short setup)
---
### RKT (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Supply Encountered / Weak Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
W2 was a Buying Climax, immediately met by heavy supply (W3, W4). W5 is a low volume down bar (RelVol 0.35), often a test signal, but the poor close (CLV -0.69) shows residual weakness. Supply has the short-term advantage, making the support level critical.

**Key Levels:** Resistance 21.37, Support 20.64

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 21.00 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 20.53
---
### RTO (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Pullback/Test (After Buying Climax/Effort to Rise)

**Smart Money Logic:**
W3 and W4 confirmed massive institutional demand (Stopping Volume/Climax). W5 is a low-volume reactionary down bar closing poorly. This is likely a test of the demand established below 33.00. The underlying trend is bullish, but we need the test to complete successfully.

**Key Levels:** Resistance 33.45, Demand Support 32.16

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Successful Test (narrow range up on low volume) near 32.17.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 31.54
---
### SA (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Pullback/Reaction to Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
W4 was a strong demand bar pushing price to new highs (37.99). W5 reacted sharply downward, closing poorly, though on moderate volume. This suggests immediate supply initiation at the top. We are monitoring for a low-volume test of the W4 breakout zone (31.75).

**Key Levels:** Resistance 37.99, Support 32.47

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Clear Test (narrow spread, low volume up bar) near 32.50.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 31.75
---
### SPOT (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Weakness Confirmed

**Smart Money Logic:**
SPOT is in a severe markdown. While W4 provided a strong rally, W5 immediately reversed the move with a down bar closing poorly (CLV -0.75). This failure confirms the persistence of overhead supply and the continuing bearish trend, despite the lower volume on W5.

**Key Levels:** Resistance 520.00, Support 507.12

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Breakdown below 507.12.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 520.00
---
### TFX (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result (Failed Rally)

**Smart Money Logic:**
TFX is in a strong markdown (W2, W3). The rally attempts in W4 and W5 failed to achieve strong bullish closes, indicating persistent overhead supply. W5 is a narrow up bar on average volume, suggesting stabilization but lacking the conviction needed to reverse the confirmed bearish trend.

**Key Levels:** Resistance 106.65, Support 103.01

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Breakdown below 103.01.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 106.65

### USIG (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Distribution / Effort No Result (High volume churning)

**Smart Money Logic:**
USIG is displaying high volume churning in a tight range (W2, W3), indicative of institutional distribution or absorption. W5 is a low volume down bar. Given the Supply Dominance tag, the churning suggests smart money is selling, but the price is constrained. Awaiting break confirmation.

**Key Levels:** Resistance 52.11, Support 51.90

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Breakdown below 51.81 (W3 Low) on confirming volume for short.
- **Invalidation:** Break above 52.11
---
### WGMI (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Quiet Strength (Slowing relative volume but strong close)

**Smart Money Logic:**
WGMI is in a strong uptrend. W5 is a wide spread up bar with a strong close, indicating demand control. Although relative volume declined, the strong result suggests little supply pressure (quiet strength) and momentum favoring continuation towards the monthly high.

**Key Levels:** Resistance 52.00, Support 46.27

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 52.00 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 48.77
---
### WMT (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Test / No Supply (Low volume pullback after Climax)

**Smart Money Logic:**
W3 was a clear Buying Climax (RelVol 5.12). W4 confirmed the liquidation. W5 is a continuation of the pullback on very low volume, which is characteristic of a Test following a climatic event. We are monitoring for a rebound confirming demand at 115.48, or failure.

**Key Levels:** Climax High 121.23, Support 115.48

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Strong reversal bar (up bar, strong CLV) above 116.50.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 115.48

### AEO (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax / Supply Follow-through

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly chart flagged a Buying Climax, suggesting distribution occurred near the highs. The subsequent weekly action confirms this weakness. The 2026-01-19 candle showed a wide spread down, closing near its absolute low (-0.95 CLV) on average volume (RelVol 0.68). This is significant selling. The final week (2026-01-26) followed through with another down week, tight spread, closing near the low (-0.80 CLV), confirming strong supply presence and a Selling Climax phase rejection.

**Key Levels:** 28.46 (Major Supply High), 23.00 (Selling Climax Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $23.00 (Recent Low) on volume.
- **Invalidation:** $24.36 (High of the last weak rally)

### AEVA (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Reversal Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The ticker experienced a massive upthrust (2026-01-05, RelVol 3.54) immediately followed by a Supply Dominance candle (2026-01-19, wide spread down, -0.98 CLV, high volume RelVol 1.23). This pattern suggests the high volume rally was a Buying Climax that Smart Money used for distribution. The last week (2026-01-26) confirmed the weakness with another down-close, indicating follow-through supply. The monthly chart also shows a Buying Climax being tested.

**Key Levels:** 22.62 (Buying Climax High), 13.85 (Immediate Support/Demand)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $13.85 (Recent Low) on volume.
- **Invalidation:** $15.81 (High of the last weak rally)

### AIG (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly chart shows confirmed Supply Dominance. The week of 2026-01-05 saw a wide spread down, closing near the absolute low (-0.92 CLV) on extremely high volume (RelVol 1.8), signaling massive institutional liquidation/selling. The subsequent two weeks saw minor attempts to rally that failed, and the final week (2026-01-26) was tight spread but closed weakly (-0.26 CLV) on low volume (RelVol 0.44). This confirms the dominance of supply initiated in early January, overcoming the bullish monthly close from December.

**Key Levels:** 85.69 (Supply Zone High), 71.25 (Selling Climax Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $72.80 (recent support area) on high volume.
- **Invalidation:** $74.40 (High of the last weak rally)

### ARES (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Supply Follow-through

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly chart flagged a Buying Climax Watch. The weekly action confirms this. The week of 2026-01-19 was a wide spread down, closing at the absolute low (-0.97 CLV) on average volume (RelVol 0.64), indicating strong supply entering the market. The next week (2026-01-26) followed through with another down week, tight spread, closing near the low (-0.09 CLV) on slightly higher volume (RelVol 0.72). This confirms that Smart Money has entered the distribution phase, reversing the short-term bullish move.

**Key Levels:** 177.72 (Buying Climax High), 145.46 (Selling Climax Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $145.46 (Selling Climax Low) on volume.
- **Invalidation:** $155.09 (High of the last weak rally)

### AVAV (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Strong Reversal

**Smart Money Logic:**
The market saw extreme volatility peaking in the 2026-01-05 week (wide spread up, high volume RelVol 2.09). The following week (2026-01-12) saw the high volume move fail to hold gains (CLV 0.50). The 2026-01-19 candle showed a massive reversal: wide spread down, closing near the absolute low (-0.82 CLV) on high volume (RelVol 1.44). This is a confirmed Buying Climax and subsequent immediate markdown. The last week (2026-01-26) was a minor down-close on lower volume (RelVol 0.8), confirming the supply dominance and the end of the rapid markup phase.

**Key Levels:** 408.25 (Climax High), 298.53 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $298.53 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** $321.04 (High of the last weak rally)

### AXTI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Reversal Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
This ticker saw an extremely strong high-volume Buying Climax move (2026-01-05, RelVol 3.82). The following week (2026-01-12) was a wide spread up that closed significantly lower (CLV -0.37) on high volume (RelVol 1.85), showing immediate selling (Upthrust After Distribution). The 2026-01-19 candle was a wide spread down, closing near the low (-0.86 CLV), confirming Supply Dominance. The latest week (2026-01-26) followed through with a down-close on high volume (RelVol 0.78, high for a down week), confirming strong supply presence and reversal into a markdown phase.

**Key Levels:** 26.66 (Climax High), 16.36 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $16.36 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** $19.00 (High of the last weak rally)

### BFH (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume Failure / Supply Reassertion

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly chart flagged a confirmed early Stopping Volume on 2026-01-12 (high volume, wide spread, positive CLV 0.86). This typically suggests accumulation. However, the subsequent two weeks negated this signal. The 2026-01-19 candle was a massive down-close (-0.91 CLV) on average volume. The final week (2026-01-26) confirmed this reversal with a down-close near the low (-0.90 CLV) on average volume (RelVol 0.58). The strong bearish momentum and failure to hold the prior stopping action suggests the accumulation failed, and supply remains dominant, despite the bullish quarterly context.

**Key Levels:** 82.03 (Supply High), 68.07 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $68.07 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** $70.80 (High of the last weak rally)

### BKKT (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
This ticker saw a classic Buying Climax in the 2026-01-12 week (wide spread up, high CLV 0.78, high volume RelVol 1.05). This move failed immediately. The 2026-01-19 candle was a wide spread down, closing near the low (-0.72 CLV) on high volume (RelVol 0.78), confirming strong Supply Dominance. The last week (2026-01-26) followed through with a down-close near the low (-0.13 CLV) on very low volume (RelVol 0.33). This low volume weakness confirms the immediate reversal and suggests a markdown continuation.

**Key Levels:** 22.11 (Climax High), 13.69 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $13.69 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** $15.57 (High of the last weak rally)

### BRBR (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Weak Rally

**Smart Money Logic:**
The market is in a strong markdown phase. The 2025-12-29 candle was a wide spread down, closing at the absolute low (-0.99 CLV) on average volume (RelVol 0.78). Following a failed rally attempt (2026-01-19, high CLV, average volume), the last week (2026-01-26) confirmed supply dominance with a wide spread down, closing near the low (-0.88 CLV) on average volume (RelVol 0.82). The strong close down indicates that the prior rally was a weak reaction and that institutional selling is continuing unabated.

**Key Levels:** 28.26 (Rally High/Supply), 24.64 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $24.64 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** $27.11 (High of the last weak rally)

### BRZE (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Monthly) / Supply Follow-through

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly chart confirmed early Buying Climax. The weekly chart confirms strong supply. The 2026-01-12 candle was a massive down-move (Spread 7.58) closing near the low (-0.95 CLV) on high volume (RelVol 1.55), indicating heavy selling (Selling Climax). Although there was a bounce (2026-01-19), the final week (2026-01-26) reasserted supply with a wide spread down, closing near the low (-0.89 CLV) on low volume (RelVol 0.63). This weak close on low volume indicates No Demand and confirms the current markdown phase.

**Key Levels:** 34.53 (Supply High), 23.64 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $23.64 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** $26.14 (High of the last weak rally)

### BWIN (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Weak Rally

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly chart flagged Supply Dominance. The weekly chart confirms strong institutional selling. The last candle (2026-01-26) was a wide spread down, closing near the absolute low (-0.91 CLV) on average volume (RelVol 0.84). This signals strong supply reasserting control after a short, weak rally attempt in the previous two weeks. The failure to maintain the rally and the subsequent strong down-close confirms the path of least resistance is down, aligning with the monthly bearish context.

**Key Levels:** 27.01 (Rally High/Supply), 22.68 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $22.68 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** $25.85 (High of the last weak rally)
---
### CBRL (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly chart flagged Supply Dominance. The rally into mid-January (2026-01-12) on high volume was followed by a massive reversal (2026-01-19): wide spread down, closing near the low (-0.87 CLV) on volume (RelVol 0.71), signaling strong supply entry. The last weekly bar (2026-01-26) attempted an up-move but closed down (-0.49 CLV) on low volume (RelVol 0.54). This low volume weakness (No Demand) confirms that the prior selling pressure remains dominant and the markup phase has failed.

**Key Levels:** 36.64 (Supply High), 28.62 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $28.62 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** $31.83 (High of the last weak rally)
