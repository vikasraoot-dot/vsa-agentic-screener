## 🚀 Ready for Entry
### ABVX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Potential Reversal

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence shows a confirmed strong Buying Climax (Weekly 2026-01-05 and 2026-01-12 had high volume and wide spreads, followed by a significant downturn. Monthly context is Supply Dominance. The last week (2026-02-02) is an up bar on very low volume (RelVol 0.21), suggesting lack of commitment from professional money for the continuation of the rally. This low volume rally attempt after strong recent downside confirms underlying weakness. Price is currently testing a recent low volume area.

**Key Levels:** 138.69 (Monthly High/Climax Peak), 107.41 (Immediate Support/Last Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 107.41 (Last Low)
- **Invalidation:** Close above 125.97 (Mid-climax zone)
---
### AEVA (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Downside Continuation

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BEARISH, and both weekly and monthly sequences confirm early Supply Dominance. Weekly 2026-01-05 was an upthrust/climax, immediately followed by two weeks of heavy selling (high volume, wide spreads down, low CLV). The last two weeks are bearish, culminating in a very narrow spread up bar on low volume (RelVol 0.30) that barely managed to close higher, suggesting total lack of demand after the recent collapse (15.76 to 12.30). This is poor rallying power and signals continuation of the downtrend.

**Key Levels:** 12.19 (Immediate Support), 15.76 (Immediate Resistance/Supply), 22.62 (Major Supply Peak)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 12.19 (Downside confirmation)
- **Invalidation:** Close above 15.81
---
### ALL (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BEARISH, and weekly sequence is confirmed strong Supply Dominance. The week 2026-01-12 was a major shock wave (wide spread down, very high relative volume 2.04, CLV -0.94), shattering the previous support. This is clear professional selling. The subsequent bars are consolidative with mixed closes. The last bar (2026-02-02) is an up bar on very low volume (RelVol 0.33), indicating extremely weak demand after the major supply event. The path of least resistance is down.

**Key Levels:** 191.13 (Support/Selling Climax Low), 204.13 (Immediate Resistance/Supply)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 191.13
- **Invalidation:** Close above 204.13
---
### AMBA (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BEARISH, and the weekly status is WATCH_FOR_TEST after Supply Dominance. Selling in 2026-01-05 and 2026-01-26 established strong supply zones. The last bar (2026-02-02) is a wide spread down bar on low volume (RelVol 0.44), closing near the low (CLV -0.65). This is a lack of demand evident during the down move. The selling pressure is maintaining itself without significant professional participation, indicating weakness into the lows (59.11).

**Key Levels:** 59.11 (Immediate Support/Selling Climax Low), 69.05 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 59.11
- **Invalidation:** Close above 65.56
---
### APH (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but weekly sequence shows early confirmed Supply Dominance. The market hit a high of 167.03, followed by a massive selling bar on 2026-01-26 (highest volume of the last 5 weeks, widest spread, closing near the low with CLV -0.69). This is clear institutional selling/distribution. The last bar (2026-02-02) is an up bar on low volume (RelVol 0.46), closing mid-to-high (CLV 0.47). This is a weak reaction rally after a major selling wave, suggesting demand is insufficient to overcome the heavy supply.

**Key Levels:** 140.00 (Major Support/Selling Climax Low), 167.03 (Supply Peak)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 141.00 on increased volume (Confirmation of markdown)
- **Invalidation:** Close above 156.27
---
### ARES (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BEARISH, reinforced by Monthly Buying Climax (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The weekly sequence shows strong distribution/supply overriding demand. Week 2026-01-19 was a wide spread down bar on high volume, closing near the low (CLV -0.97). The last bar (2026-02-02) is a very wide spread down bar on high volume (RelVol 0.95), closing near the absolute low of the range (CLV -0.70). This is strong, confirmed downside continuation by smart money, breaking below multiple preceding lows. Clear markdown phase is in effect.

**Key Levels:** 128.25 (New Low/Target), 155.09 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 128.25
- **Invalidation:** Close above 155.09
---
### AS (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BEARISH, and the monthly status suggests Supply Dominance. The weekly chart shows consistent weakness, especially 2026-01-26 (high volume down, CLV -0.78). The last bar (2026-02-02) is a wide spread down bar on low volume (RelVol 0.49), closing mid-range (CLV -0.49). The price failed to close strong on low volume, indicating continued weakness and lack of demand. The low volume downside move suggests little resistance for the next leg down.

**Key Levels:** 35.18 (Immediate Support/New Low), 38.90 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 35.18
- **Invalidation:** Close above 37.74
---
### AXTI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Buying Climax (Monthly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the monthly status is confirmed early Buying Climax, signaling distribution. The weekly sequence confirms early Supply Dominance. The first week (2026-01-05) was a massive wide spread up bar on huge volume (RelVol 3.82), a potential climax. This was followed by sharp downside rejection and wide spread down bars (2026-01-19 CLV -0.86, 2026-01-26 CLV 0.18 but price below open). The last bar (2026-02-02) is an up bar on low volume (RelVol 0.68), but the close is weak (CLV -0.23). This low volume reaction rally is failing at resistance (19.73), confirming supply is overriding the bullish quarterly trend.

**Key Levels:** 18.20 (Immediate Support), 26.65 (Supply Peak)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 18.20 on volume (Short setup)
- **Invalidation:** Close above 22.20
---
### BAH (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Monthly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BEARISH, but the monthly status is WATCH_FOR_TEST after a Buying Climax. Week 2026-01-26 was a massive Sign of Weakness (SOW) — wide spread down bar on high volume (RelVol 1.72), closing near the low (CLV -0.84). This confirms heavy supply entering the market, likely distribution. The last bar (2026-02-02) is a down bar on low volume (RelVol 0.43), closing near the low (CLV -0.82), indicating virtually no demand stepping in to support the price after the SOW. Clear downside continuation expected.

**Key Levels:** 82.50 (Immediate Support/Last Low), 109.09 (Supply Peak)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 82.50 on volume (Short setup)
- **Invalidation:** Close above 98.19

### BKKT (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the monthly status is WATCH_FOR_TEST after a Buying Climax. Volatility is extreme. The climax occurred around 2026-01-12 (22.11 high). The price collapsed immediately. The last bar (2026-02-02) is a narrow spread up bar on very low volume (RelVol 0.18), closing mid-range (CLV near 0). This is extremely poor effort after major downside (15.50 to 11.35), confirming lack of demand and underlying weakness. Markdown is confirmed by the sustained sell-off after the climax.

**Key Levels:** 11.35 (Immediate Support/Last Low), 22.11 (Supply Peak)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 11.35 on volume (Short setup)
- **Invalidation:** Close above 15.61

### BP (NEUTRAL/BULLISH WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the weekly sequence shows early confirmed Supply Dominance (2026-01-05). However, the market has shrugged off this supply and continued upward. The last bar (2026-02-02) is an up bar on low volume (RelVol 0.61), closing very high (CLV 0.87). This is a strong indication of low resistance (No Supply) during the rally. The underlying bullish trend is likely reasserting itself, despite the early supply warning, suggesting the prior supply was absorbed.

**Key Levels:** 38.91 (Recent High/Target), 37.29 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 38.91 on volume (Long confirmation)
- **Invalidation:** Break below 37.29
---
### BRBR (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Monthly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BEARISH, and the monthly status is confirmed early Stopping Volume. However, the last bar (2026-02-02) is a very wide spread down bar on high volume (RelVol 0.85), closing near the low (CLV -0.69). This is strong downside confirmation and suggests the stopping volume was overwhelmed by renewed supply, or the distribution phase is continuing. The strong SOW overrides the monthly stopping volume signal for immediate outlook.

**Key Levels:** 20.12 (New Low/Support), 25.05 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 20.12
- **Invalidation:** Close above 24.64
---
### BROS (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BEARISH, and the weekly status is WATCH_FOR_TEST after Supply Dominance. Week 2026-01-26 was a massive Sign of Weakness (SOW) — very wide spread down bar on massive volume (RelVol 2.48), closing near the low (CLV -0.74). This is clear institutional markdown. The last bar (2026-02-02) is a wide spread down bar on moderate volume (RelVol 0.71), closing mid-range (CLV -0.39). The stock failed to rally strongly on the week, indicating extreme weakness and continued pressure toward lower levels.

**Key Levels:** 52.15 (Immediate Support/SOW Low), 62.88 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 52.15
- **Invalidation:** Close above 56.56
---
### BSY (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BEARISH, and the monthly status is WATCH_FOR_TEST after Supply Dominance. Week 2026-01-26 showed high volume selling (CLV -0.72). The last bar (2026-02-02) is a wide spread down bar on low volume (RelVol 0.49), closing at the absolute low (CLV -0.95). This is highly bearish, indicating total failure of demand to show up in the selling environment. The path of least resistance is significantly lower, confirming the bearish trend.

**Key Levels:** 31.70 (New Low/Target), 35.31 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 31.70
- **Invalidation:** Close above 35.31
---
### BWIN (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BEARISH, and the monthly status is WATCH_FOR_TEST after Supply Dominance. Week 2026-01-26 was a sharp drop on high volume (RelVol 1.27, CLV -0.96), a strong Sign of Weakness. The last bar (2026-02-02) is a wide spread down bar on moderate volume (RelVol 0.68), closing mid-range (CLV -0.59). The price is moving lower and closing weak, suggesting continued institutional selling and markdown phase. The prior support (21.86) was swiftly broken.

**Key Levels:** 19.87 (New Low/Target), 22.91 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 19.87
- **Invalidation:** Close above 22.91
---
### CDE (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Preliminary Supply (Weekly/Monthly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The sequence shows significant volatility and selling pressure. The weekly sequence confirms Supply Dominance. The major reversal occurred in the week of 1/26 with an ultra-wide spread down bar (Spread 7.75) closing near the low (CLV -0.89) on Ultra-High Volume (RelVol 2.03). This is a strong sign of Smart Money distribution/dumping. The last weekly bar attempted to rally but closed in the middle (CLV 0.367) on average volume (RelVol 0.638), suggesting trapped buyers or a minor automatic rally after the steep drop. The monthly context also shows a Buying Climax followed by a severe down bar.

**Key Levels:** 27.77 (All-time high/Supply), 20.02 (Immediate support/Bottom of previous widespread down bar), 22.60 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short: Break and close below 20.02 (Low of 1/26 bar). Long: A definitive test of 20.02 with high demand confirmation.
- **Invalidation:** 22.60 (Close above signals strong absorption of supply)
---
### CNQ (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence is moving aggressively higher, confirming the Quarterly BULLISH TREND. The last bar (2/2) is an up bar closing near the high (CLV 0.891) on slightly lower volume (RelVol 0.565). This is indicative of strong demand and ease of movement, often seen after a successful prior accumulation phase. The system flagged Stopping Volume (1/26) due to the wide spread up but closing in the middle (CLV 0.171) on high volume (RelVol 1.139). This suggests minor supply was met, but the subsequent action (2/2) successfully pushes higher. We are currently in a markup phase.

**Key Levels:** 38.32 (Recent high/Next target), 36.40 (Prior consolidation support), 35.64 (Major support/Spring low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Long: Pullback entry to 37.00 level showing low volume support or a decisive move above 38.32.
- **Invalidation:** 36.40 (Close below suggests failed markup)
---
### CPNG (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Weekly/Monthly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH and the weekly/monthly VSA confirms persistent supply. The move is a continued markdown. The last bar (2/2) is a down bar closing near the low (CLV -0.598) on low volume (RelVol 0.513). This confirms the ease of movement down (no effort required to push lower), a highly bearish sign. The preceding wide-spread down bar (1/12, CLV -0.618 on high volume) confirmed the supply dominance.

**Key Levels:** 20.97 (Immediate resistance), 19.10 (Immediate low/Support), 18.55 (Key low from Jan)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short: Close below 19.10 on increasing volume.

The subsequent bar (2/2) confirms the weakness, showing an ultra-wide spread down (Spread 11.09) closing at the absolute low (CLV -0.971) on high volume (RelVol 0.855). This is strong Supply Dominance, confirming the continuation of the markdown phase. The monthly chart also confirms strong supply domination (CLV -0.971).

**Key Levels:** 62.67 (Immediate Resistance), 51.57 (Current Low/Support), 70.57 (Major Supply)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short: Break and close below 51.57.

This indicates extreme weakness and ease of movement down. The prior week (1/26) was also a strong down bar (CLV -0.949), confirming persistent supply and continued markdown.

### ENR (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort to Rise (Monthly Supply Dominance)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH. The recent monthly signal of Supply Dominance (Jan CLV 0.737, misleading label) showed strength. The last weekly bar (2/2) is a strong up bar closing near the high (CLV 0.623) on slightly lower volume (RelVol 0.542). This suggests strong demand is easily propelling the price higher, indicating Markup continuation. The market is absorbing any prior weakness (1/12, 1/19 weak bars).

**Key Levels:** 23.28 (Recent high/Next target), 21.56 (Immediate support/Spring low), 19.81 (Major support)

#### Action Plan

### GBCI (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Monthly Supply Dominance (Bullish Context)

**Smart Money Logic:**

The last bar (2/2) is a wide spread down, closing in the middle/low half (CLV -0.415) on high volume (RelVol 1.196). Although volume suggests some buying, the wide spread and poor close confirm supply is overwhelming demand. Continuation of markdown expected.

The last bar (2/2) is a wide spread down, closing in the middle/low (CLV -0.101) on low volume (RelVol 0.351). The weak close confirms weakness, and low volume suggests ease of movement down, continuing the markdown.

**Key Levels:** 40.73 (Immediate Resistance), 36.63 (Current Low/Support), 45.69 (Prior support)

The last bar (2/2) is a wide spread down, closing in the middle/low (CLV -0.080) on low volume (RelVol 0.671). The low volume confirms the ease of movement down, indicating supply is still in control and the markdown is continuing.

### ITT (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Monthly Supply Dominance (Bullish Context)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH. The monthly chart signaled Supply Dominance (Jan CLV 0.283 on high volume, suggesting distribution). However, the weekly action remains strong. The last bar (2/2) is an up bar closing near the high (CLV 0.228) on ultra-low volume (RelVol 0.457). This suggests ease of movement up.

### KDP (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Monthly Buying Climax (Bullish Context)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH. Monthly action showed a Buying Climax (Dec CLV -0.749, suggesting absorption). The weekly action is stable and bullish. The last bar (2/2) is an up bar closing near the high (CLV 0.547) on ultra-low volume (RelVol 0.243). This confirms ease of movement up and strong underlying demand. The volume is declining, which, given the stability, suggests demand is easily overcoming minor supply.

### KVYO (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Weekly) / Supply Dominance (Monthly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH. Both charts show bearish structure. The month of Jan showed strong supply (CLV -0.967). The last weekly bar (2/2) is a wide spread down bar, closing near the low (CLV -0.842) on low volume (RelVol 0.504). This confirms the ease of movement down, which, in a bearish context, suggests continuation of the markdown. The earlier 'Stopping Volume' signal (1/19) seems to have failed to generate sustained demand.

**Key Levels:** 23.43 (Immediate Resistance), 19.87 (Current Low/Support), 22.21 (Prior support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short: Break and close below 19.87 on increasing volume.

---
### LHX (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH, and the price is in a strong markup phase. The week of 1/26 showed a wide spread down, closing near the low (CLV -0.783) on high volume (RelVol 1.39), which suggests supply entering (Preliminary Supply/Shakeout). However, the last bar (2/2) is a strong up bar, closing near the absolute high (CLV 0.978) on ultra-low volume (RelVol 0.451). This is extreme ease of movement up, suggesting the prior selling was absorbed and demand is overwhelming. Continuation of markup expected.

**Key Levels:** 369.59 (Major Supply), 335.63 (Immediate Support), 342.85 (Prior low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Long: Break and close above 369.59.

---
### MOD (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH. The weekly chart shows explosive upward movement, confirming markup. The week of 1/26 was an ultra-wide spread up (Spread 50.97) closing near the high (CLV 0.781) on high volume (RelVol 1.78), potentially a Buying Climax, but also indicative of strong demand. The last bar (2/2) is a wide spread up bar, closing in the middle/high (CLV 0.424) on high volume (RelVol 0.937). Demand remains strong, and Smart Money is still buying/accumulating. Continuation expected.

**Key Levels:** 205.74 (Recent high/Next target), 184.00 (Immediate Support/Prior resistance), 190.22 (Prior resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Long: Break and close above 205.74, or pullback to 190.00 showing low volume.

The last bar (2/2) continues the extreme weakness: wide spread down, closing near the low (CLV -0.758) on high volume (RelVol 1.42). This confirms aggressive markdown continuation.

This is a textbook Buying Climax/Supply Dominance, indicating Smart Money distribution at the high. The last bar (2/2) is a wide spread down, closing in the middle/low half (CLV -0.399) on low volume (RelVol 0.872). The movement down is confirmed, suggesting distribution is active and markdown is beginning.

**Key Levels:** 218.22 (Climax High/Major Supply), 163.91 (Current Low/Support), 185.22 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short: Close below 163.91. Long: Strong demand confirmation above 185.22.

### NFXL (BEARISH)

The Quarterly trend is BEARISH. The overall trend is strongly down. The last weekly bar (2/2) is a wide spread down bar, closing near the low (CLV -0.869) on ultra-low volume (RelVol 0.465). This indicates extreme weakness and confirms the ease of movement down, despite the low volume suggesting the market is exhausted of buyers. This is a continuation of the markdown phase.

**Key Levels:** 24.97 (Immediate Resistance), 21.75 (Current Low/Support), 23.33 (Prior support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short: Break and close below 21.75.

---
### OC (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Monthly Stopping Volume (Bullish Context)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH. The monthly chart shows Stopping Volume (Jan CLV 0.163 on high volume), likely denoting a shakeout or accumulation. The weekly chart shows stability. The week of 1/26 was a strong down bar (CLV -0.296) on high volume (RelVol 1.156), possibly testing the lower range. The last bar (2/2) is a wide spread up bar, closing in the middle/high (CLV 0.178) on low volume (RelVol 0.600). The price successfully moved higher despite low effort, suggesting absorption and continuation of markup.

**Key Levels:** 129.00 (Recent high/Next target), 119.16 (Immediate Support), 125.30 (Prior resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Long: Break and close above 129.00.

---
### ONB (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Monthly Supply Dominance (Bullish Context)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH. The monthly chart signaled Supply Dominance (Dec CLV -0.230, Jan CLV 0.745). The weekly action is definitively bullish. The last bar (2/2) is a strong up bar closing near the absolute high (CLV 0.914) on ultra-low volume (RelVol 0.377). This is highly bullish, confirming ease of movement and strong underlying demand. The market is in a Markup phase and is ready to push higher.

**Key Levels:** 25.45 (Recent high/Next target), 24.28 (Immediate Support), 23.56 (Prior support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Long: Break and close above 25.45. Short: Close below 24.28.

---
### PTGX (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Potential Stopping Volume / Change of Character

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stock is in a BEARISH_TREND quarterly, but the monthly context is BUYING_CLIMAX (CONFIRMED_EARLY), suggesting weakness. However, the last weekly bar closed near the high (CLV 0.796) on low volume (RelVol 0.439). This close near the high, despite low volume, represents a strong effort to absorb supply around the 81-85 range (after recent downside tests). The previous three weeks had supply absorbing characteristics (close below mid-point). The last bar suggests buying strength is holding, potentially stabilizing the price ahead of a mark-up. This appears to be a successful Test of supply.

**Key Levels:** Support: 78.75 (Recent low), Immediate Resistance: 86.10 (Last week's high), Target Resistance: 88.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and hold above 86.10 with confirming volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 79.00
---
### RARE (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Successful Test / Sign of Strength

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly/weekly sequence is SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (CONFIRMED_EARLY), suggesting weakness, but the recent price action indicates reversal. The last bar is a narrow spread up-close (CLV 0.097, but open was near the low) on extremely low volume (RelVol 0.554). This action, following the previous week's wide spread down candle (Jan 26) that closed in the middle (-0.06 CLV), suggests supply has been absorbed or is currently absent. The preceding high volume weeks (Jan 5 & 12) were likely accumulation efforts. This low volume advance acts as a successful Test, confirming the absorption.

**Key Levels:** Support: 23.50, Immediate Resistance: 25.82, Validation Level: 22.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and sustain above 25.85.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 23.50
---
### RF (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Strength Confirmed

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but monthly is SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (CONFIRMED_EARLY), indicating recent selling pressure. However, the last weekly bar showed a good spread up-close (CLV 0.934) on significantly low volume (RelVol 0.314). This suggests high efficiency in the mark-up phase, as supply resistance has been overcome without requiring huge volume, a sign of underlying strength (SOS). This low volume push indicates a healthy move up, likely after a successful test of previous weakness.

**Key Levels:** Support: 28.36 (Last week's low), Immediate Resistance: 29.88 (Last week's high), Target Resistance: 30.20 (Previous range high)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and sustain above 29.90.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 28.50
---
### RGTI (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Minor Sign of Strength (MSOS)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BEARISH, but the monthly context is BUYING_CLIMAX (CONFIRMED_EARLY), suggesting a strong reversal is already in play. The price plummeted hard on high volume (Jan 26 Selling Climax-like action, CLV -0.82). The last weekly bar shows a narrow spread up-close (CLV 0.725) on extremely low volume (RelVol 0.18). This is a strong positive sign (MSOS), indicating that the immediate supply was easily overcome, and price closed strong despite very low participation. This suggests Smart Money is controlling the area around 17.50.

**Key Levels:** Support: 17.14 (Recent Low/Potential SC), Immediate Resistance: 18.38 (Last week's High), Confirmation Break: 20.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and hold above 18.40.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 17.00

### RLI (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Test/Sign of Strength

**Smart Money Logic:**
RLI is in a BEARISH_TREND quarterly, but the recent monthly action showed SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (CONFIRMED_EARLY). The last weekly bar shows a positive move: narrow spread up-close (CLV 0.604) on significantly low volume (RelVol 0.384). This low volume push higher suggests that supply has been successfully absorbed or is currently absent (successful Test), and Smart Money is in control. This is a positive change of character after the high-volume selling seen earlier in January.

**Key Levels:** Support: 58.15, Immediate Resistance: 60.02, Target Resistance: 61.50

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and hold above 60.02.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 58.00
---
### RTO (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply/Test (Confirmed Strong)

**Smart Money Logic:**
RTO has confirmed STOPPING_VOLUME. The week of Jan 26 was a reaction down (CLV -0.78) on high volume (RelVol 1.36). The last weekly bar is a bullish reversal: narrow spread up-close (CLV 0.863) on lower volume (RelVol 0.70). This combination suggests a successful Test of the recent supply, indicating Smart Money stepped in near the lows of the previous week and absorbed the selling without effort. The current status confirms strong bullish intent.

**Key Levels:** Support: 31.36 (Test Low), Immediate Resistance: 32.20, Target Resistance: 33.46 (Previous High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and sustain above 32.20.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 31.28
---
### SA (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Preliminary Sign of Strength (PSOS)

**Smart Money Logic:**
SA is in a BULLISH_TREND quarterly, but the monthly sequence is SUPPLY_DOMINANCE, highlighted by the Jan 26 bar (wide spread down, high volume, CLV -0.97). This action signals a sharp shakeout/selling climax. The last weekly bar shows a wide spread up move (CLV 0.336) on very low volume (RelVol 0.46). The up move itself on low volume is an immediate positive response (PSOS). Smart Money is likely absorbing the shakeout and starting the mark-up phase without much effort required.

**Key Levels:** Support: 27.41 (Shakeout Low), Immediate Resistance: 30.74, Major Resistance: 36.37

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and sustain above 30.75.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 28.00
---
### SONY (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Continuation

**Smart Money Logic:**
SONY is in a BEARISH_TREND quarterly, and the weekly sequence shows SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The last five weeks consistently show negative closes and low CLV, indicative of persistent institutional selling. The last weekly bar is narrow spread on average volume (RelVol 0.68), closing near the low (CLV -0.65). This is not a classic 'No Demand' due to the volume being decent, but it confirms continued weakness and distribution pressure, as buyers fail to step in effectively.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Resistance: 22.37, Support: 21.84 (Last week's low), Major Resistance: 24.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and sustain below 21.80.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 22.50
---
### SPOT (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Continuation / Weakness Confirmed

**Smart Money Logic:**
SPOT is deep in a BEARISH_TREND, confirmed by SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The last weekly bar is wide spread down (Spread 48.04) on good volume (RelVol 0.714), closing near the low (CLV -0.59). This confirms continued selling pressure and institutional involvement on the downside. The high volume selling climax from January is confirmed as ongoing distribution, not accumulation. This is a follow-through weakness bar.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Resistance: 500.35, Support: 464.24 (Last week's low), Major Supply Zone: 520.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and sustain below 464.00.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 497.00
---
### SYF (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Secondary Test / Preliminary Sign of Strength

**Smart Money Logic:**
SYF is in a BEARISH_TREND quarterly, and SUPPLY_DOMINANCE is confirmed weekly. The Jan 26 bar was a significant down move on high volume (RelVol 2.13), likely a selling climax/shakeout. The last weekly bar is a narrow spread up-close (CLV 0.345) on very low volume (RelVol 0.464). This low volume rally, following the shakeout, is a Preliminary Sign of Strength (PSOS) or a Test, indicating institutional absorption of the selling. The price held the prior low strongly.

**Key Levels:** Support: 72.22 (Shakeout Low), Immediate Resistance: 74.71, Breakout Zone: 77.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and sustain above 74.75.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 72.20
---
### TFX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Demand / Supply Continuation

**Smart Money Logic:**
TFX is in a BEARISH_TREND quarterly, confirmed by SUPPLY_DOMINANCE weekly. The last weekly bar is narrow spread on decent volume (RelVol 0.80), closing near the low (CLV -0.577). This confirms continued institutional selling or lack of buying support (No Demand) as price failed to rally strongly on lower volume. The market is highly efficient in moving down, suggesting underlying weakness persists.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Support: 101.69 (Last week's low), Resistance: 104.91, Supply Zone: 107.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and sustain below 101.60.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 104.50
---
### WGMI (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Preliminary Sign of Strength (PSOS)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly context is BUYING_CLIMAX (CONFIRMED_EARLY), suggesting a top, but the recent weekly action indicates institutional activity at lower levels. The Jan 26 bar was a wide spread down on high volume (RelVol 1.15), closing near the low (CLV -0.82), signaling a shakeout/Selling Climax. The last weekly bar is a wide spread up move (CLV 0.357) on low volume (RelVol 0.52). This low volume advance is a Preliminary Sign of Strength, showing that the recent sellers were easily overcome and supply is currently limited, allowing the price to rally without effort.

**Key Levels:** Support: 42.51 (Shakeout Low), Immediate Resistance: 46.62, Target Resistance: 50.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and sustain above 46.62.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 43.50
---
### WHR (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Successful Test / Sign of Strength

**Smart Money Logic:**
WHR's weekly sequence is STOPPING_VOLUME (WATCH_FOR_TEST), after the wide spread down bar on high volume on Jan 26 (RelVol 2.14). The last weekly bar is a strong wide spread up-close (CLV 0.732) on lower volume (RelVol 0.685). The close near the high on significantly reduced volume is a strong Sign of Strength (SOS), indicating supply was successfully absorbed or is absent, and Smart Money is initiating the mark-up phase efficiently.

**Key Levels:** Support: 77.61 (Last week's low), Immediate Resistance: 86.72 (Last week's high), Target Resistance: 90.21

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and sustain above 86.75.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 78.50
---
### WPM (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Secondary Test / Preliminary Sign of Strength

**Smart Money Logic:**
WPM confirmed SUPPLY_DOMINANCE weekly following the Jan 26 bar, which was a massive wide spread down on very high volume (RelVol 1.92), suggesting a major shakeout/selling climax. The last weekly bar is a wide spread up-close (CLV 0.407) on low volume (RelVol 0.68). The low volume rally following the climax is a Preliminary Sign of Strength (PSOS), suggesting Smart Money absorbed the prior supply. The rally required low effort, confirming limited remaining supply.

**Key Levels:** Support: 129.12 (Shakeout Low), Immediate Resistance: 140.00, Validation Level: 152.12

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and sustain above 140.00.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 129.00
---
### WRB (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Successful Test / Sign of Strength

**Smart Money Logic:**
WRB's monthly context is SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (CONFIRMED_EARLY), suggesting residual weakness. However, the weekly chart confirmed STOPPING_VOLUME (Jan 26 high volume reaction). The last weekly bar is a narrow spread up-close (CLV 0.834) on significantly low volume (RelVol 0.31). This low volume push to close near the high is a highly effective Test of supply, showing that selling pressure has dried up and Smart Money is initiating a mark-up phase with ease. This suggests accumulation is complete at these levels.

**Key Levels:** Support: 67.25 (Last week's low), Immediate Resistance: 69.92, Target Resistance: 71.08

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and sustain above 69.92.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 68.50
---
### ZM (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Weakness after Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
ZM's weekly sequence is BUYING_CLIMAX (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The Jan 26 bar saw high volume (RelVol 2.00) and a wide spread, but closed near the high (CLV 0.019), indicating significant supply absorption at the top. The last weekly bar is a wide spread down (Spread 6.37) on lower volume (RelVol 0.68), closing near the low (CLV -0.74). This is a strong indication of weakness; the rally attempt failed, confirming that the Jan 26 bar was indeed climactic buying followed by distribution, leading to heavy downside pressure on the subsequent bar.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 94.29, Immediate Support: 87.92 (Last week's low), Confirmation Break: 86.40

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and sustain below 87.90.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 92.50
---
## 👀 Watch/Monitoring
### ABT (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence is marked by strong selling (Weekly 2026-01-19: Very wide spread down bar on high relative volume, CLV -0.80) followed by attempts to rally (last two weeks show slightly higher closes, but the spreads are narrowing, and volume is decreasing, especially the last week's volume is significantly low relative to the selling climax). The quarterly context is BEARISH. The overall structure suggests weakness and potential for a test of the 105.77 level. The last bar is a narrow spread down bar on low volume, which could precede a rally, but given the overwhelming supply earlier, it might be a temporary consolidation before further decline, especially since the close is below the open. The algorithmic status is 'WATCH_FOR_TEST' after a large supply absorption/dominance.

**Key Levels:** 120.92 (Recent Support/Test Level), 105.77 (Major Low/Selling Climax Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 106.00 (Short setup confirmation) or rejection of 115.00 (Failure to rally)
- **Invalidation:** Close above 122.00
---
### ACLX (NEUTRAL/BEARISH WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Monthly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stock is in a Quarterly BULLISH trend but the Monthly context shows Supply Dominance. The weekly chart is messy, with a very wide spread down bar on high volume on 2026-01-19 (CLV -0.67), indicating supply. The last two weeks show attempts to recover (narrower spreads, lower volume), but the close of the last bar is mid-range with very low relative volume (0.29), suggesting demand is weak on this minor upward move. Need confirmation of either accumulation or further distribution. Currently consolidating after a sharp reaction.

**Key Levels:** 76.50 (Recent High/Supply Zone), 66.00 (Immediate Support), 60.35 (Major Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 67.70 (Short) or clean breakout above 70.11 on increasing volume (Long)
- **Invalidation:** Close above 70.11
---
### ACWX (NEUTRAL/BEARISH WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence shows a confirmed early Buying Climax. The last 4 weeks have seen extremely high relative volume (2.13 to 1.91) on narrow to medium spreads, indicating heavy selling into strength (distribution). The last bar (2026-02-02) is an up bar on low relative volume (0.72), which is typical exhaustion behavior after a climax phase, failing to sustain the high volume push. The wide spread down bar on 2026-01-26 (CLV -0.68) confirms the presence of supply. Prices are hugging the recent highs, waiting for a definitive break.

**Key Levels:** 72.33 (Climax High), 70.48 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 70.48 on confirmation volume (Short)
- **Invalidation:** Close above 72.33
---
### AGIO (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Monthly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BULLISH, but recent price action is volatile. The Monthly chart shows Stopping Volume confirmed early (high volume selling followed by consolidation). The recent weekly bars are erratic. Weekly 2026-01-26 showed high volume selling into the range (CLV -0.67), while the last bar (2026-02-02) is a down bar on very low volume (RelVol 0.27) closing slightly higher than the prior low, suggesting possible absorption or merely a pause. Current action is messy and lacks clear directional conviction, typical of re-accumulation or trading range behavior.

**Key Levels:** 26.25 (Key Monthly Low), 29.93 (Recent High/Supply)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Breakout above 29.93 or clear accumulation signs near 26.25
- **Invalidation:** Break below 26.25
---
### AHR (NEUTRAL/BEARISH WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence is tagged as an early confirmed Buying Climax. The volume spike on 2026-01-26 (RelVol 3.99) with a wide spread, high CLV (0.15) but only a moderate close, followed by the last bar (2026-02-02) which is a narrow spread up bar on lower volume (RelVol 0.61) with a very high CLV (0.96) reaching the top of the range. This volatility and volume spike suggest distribution near the 48.00 level. The extreme high close in the last bar could be a final push (Upthrust after Distribution or final spring), demanding careful monitoring for immediate reversal signs.

**Key Levels:** 48.80 (Recent High), 45.37 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 46.33 (Last Low of the week) on high volume
- **Invalidation:** Close above 48.80
---
### AIG (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BEARISH and weekly sequence confirms early Supply Dominance. Weeks 2026-01-05 and 2026-01-12 showed massive volume and sharp drops (selling climax followed by wide spread down bar, both high relative volume). The subsequent rally attempts are weak, particularly the last bar (2026-02-02) which is a down bar on very low volume (RelVol 0.34) closing mid-range (CLV -0.28). The lack of demand on this small selling indicates further downside is likely after the recent supply injection.

**Key Levels:** 85.69 (Major Supply Peak), 71.25 (Major Support/Selling Climax Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 73.50 on increased volume (Short)
- **Invalidation:** Close above 76.04
---
### AIQ (NEUTRAL/BEARISH WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BULLISH. The monthly sequence is a Buying Climax. Weekly price action shows deceleration since 2026-01-05 (decreasing CLV, increased volatility/spreads). The bar on 2026-01-26 was a wide spread down bar (CLV -0.80) on high volume, suggesting heavy supply. The last bar (2026-02-02) is a wide spread down bar on low volume (RelVol 0.43) closing near the low (CLV -0.41). This low volume selling suggests that if supply is still active, it isn't massive, but the lack of strong support or demand is concerning for the bullish trend.

**Key Levels:** 53.93 (Climax High), 50.33 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 50.33 (Short setup)
- **Invalidation:** Close above 52.72
---
### ALC (NEUTRAL/BULLISH WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Monthly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BEARISH, but the monthly sequence is tagged as confirmed early Stopping Volume, suggesting potential accumulation at lower levels. Weekly bars show a recent drop (2026-02-02) which is a wide spread down bar on low volume (RelVol 0.41), closing near the low (CLV -0.76). This movement into the support area (76.94) on decreasing volume is a classic 'Test for Supply' signal. If the test holds, a rally should follow. The bearish quarterly context necessitates caution.

**Key Levels:** 76.94 (Stopping Volume Low/Support), 82.50 (Supply Peak)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Strong up bar from 76.94 on increased volume (Long setup)
- **Invalidation:** Break below 76.94
---
### AMH (NEUTRAL/BULLISH WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BEARISH, but both weekly and monthly sequences show confirmed early Stopping Volume, suggesting institutional interest at current levels. The major volume spike on 2026-01-05 occurred during a down move but resulted in a mid-to-high close (CLV 0.14), which is typical of absorption. The last two weeks are consolidative and the final bar (2026-02-02) is a down bar on low volume (RelVol 0.47) closing mid-range (CLV -0.30) near the immediate support (30.12). This is a low volume test of the support zone, which is a bullish sign if followed by a strong rally.

**Key Levels:** 30.12 (Stopping Volume Support), 32.65 (Supply/Accumulation Peak)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Strong reversal bar above 31.31 on increased volume (Long setup)
- **Invalidation:** Break below 30.12
---
### AMKR (NEUTRAL/BEARISH WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the monthly sequence suggests a Buying Climax (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The weekly price action is erratic, swinging wildly. Week 2026-01-05 was high volume up; 2026-01-12 was high volume down; 2026-01-26 was high volume down (CLV -0.77). This is indicative of a wide distribution range. The last bar (2026-02-02) is a wide spread down bar on low volume (RelVol 0.46), closing near the low (CLV -0.63). This low volume downside suggests weak hands are selling, but smart money may not yet be ready to commit to reversal or markdown. We are testing the lower end of the recent volatility range (45.40).

**Key Levels:** 55.16 (Recent High/Supply), 45.40 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 45.40 (Short setup) or strong reversal on increased volume (Long setup)
- **Invalidation:** Close above 49.99
---
### APLS (NEUTRAL/BEARISH WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BEARISH. The weekly sequence shows early confirmed Buying Climax. Week 2026-01-12 was a massive down bar on high volume (RelVol 1.54, CLV -0.94), acting as a massive sign of weakness (SOW). The market rebounded (rally 2026-01-19 and 2026-01-26, high volume on the second one). The last bar (2026-02-02) is an up bar on low volume (RelVol 0.41), closing mid-to-high (CLV 0.47), attempting to push higher, but the low volume suggests this rally is unlikely to be sustained. This looks like a weak Upthrust attempt within a developing distribution phase.

**Key Levels:** 19.26 (Immediate Support), 23.79 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Rejection/failure to hold 23.00, or break below 21.59 (Short setup)
- **Invalidation:** Close above 26.54
---
### ARE (NEUTRAL/BULLISH WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Monthly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the monthly status is confirmed early Stopping Volume, signaling a potential accumulation area. Weekly action shows strong upward moves followed by a sharp reaction down on 2026-01-26 (wide spread down bar on high volume, CLV -0.54), confirming supply. The last bar (2026-02-02) is a down bar on very low volume (RelVol 0.33) closing mid-range (CLV -0.39). The low volume downside suggests the selling pressure is easing/testing the waters near 53.18. If this is a spring/test, expect an immediate high-volume up move.

**Key Levels:** 53.13 (Support/Climax Low), 59.75 (Supply Peak)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Strong up bar above 54.56 on increased volume (Long setup)
- **Invalidation:** Break below 53.13
---
### ARWR (NEUTRAL/BULLISH WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the weekly sequence shows confirmed strong Supply Dominance from the 2026-01-05 high. However, the last two weeks show attempts to rally. The final bar (2026-02-02) is a wide spread up bar on low volume (RelVol 0.35), closing mid-range (CLV 0.13). While volume is low, the price successfully rallied strongly from the weekly low (66.91) to close much higher. Given the bullish quarterly context, this action could be a low volume test before a further rally, having shaken out weak holders after the initial supply shock.

**Key Levels:** 66.91 (Immediate Support/Test Low), 76.76 (Supply Peak)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 76.11 on increased volume (Long setup)
- **Invalidation:** Break below 66.91
---
### ASML (NEUTRAL/BULLISH WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BULLISH. The weekly chart shows a Buying Climax phase. Massive volume bars occurred leading up to 2026-01-26, where a very wide spread down bar occurred (CLV -0.30, RelVol 1.96). This suggests significant selling/profit-taking near the 1493 high. The last bar (2026-02-02) is a down bar on low volume (RelVol 0.52), closing near the low (CLV -0.40). The low volume downside move suggests a low volume test after the initial supply shock. Given the underlying bullish quarterly trend, this reaction should be monitored closely for signs of accumulation/test completion.

**Key Levels:** 1371.91 (Immediate Support/Test Low), 1493.47 (Supply Peak)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Strong up bar above 1423.00 on increased volume (Long setup)
- **Invalidation:** Break below 1371.91
---
### ATO (NEUTRAL/BEARISH WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the weekly sequence is confirmed early Buying Climax. The recent action features high volume selling (2026-01-19 and 2026-01-26) with wide spreads and poor closes, suggesting distribution. The last bar (2026-02-02) is an up bar on low volume (RelVol 0.78), closing high (CLV 0.57). This is a weak attempt to rally following supply, failing to match the preceding volume. It might be a final Upthrust attempt before markdown. The price is hovering around the high end of a potential trading range.

**Key Levels:** 172.08 (Supply Peak), 164.50 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Failure to sustain 169.00 and break below 166.33
- **Invalidation:** Close above 172.08
---
### AVAV (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Monthly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the monthly status is confirmed early Buying Climax, indicating significant supply. The weekly chart shows extreme volatility. The move from 371.39 (2026-01-05 high) to 276.76 (2026-01-26 low) on extremely high volume confirms heavy distribution/supply absorption. The last bar (2026-02-02) is an up bar on low volume (RelVol 0.46), closing very high (CLV 0.98), suggesting a reaction rally. However, this reaction is on low effort and likely a weak rally to test the prior resistance (307.07) before the markdown continues.

**Key Levels:** 408.25 (Climax Peak), 265.50 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 265.50 on high volume (Short setup)
- **Invalidation:** Close above 321.04
---
### AXTA (NEUTRAL/BEARISH WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Monthly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BEARISH, but the monthly status is confirmed early Stopping Volume. Recent weekly action shows tight consolidation with generally low volume. The last bar (2026-02-02) is a wide spread down bar on low volume (RelVol 0.51), closing mid-range (CLV -0.33). This move into the lower end of the range on low volume is characteristic of a test for supply. Given the stopping volume signal, this might be a shakeout/spring before accumulation completes. However, the close is below the open, keeping the current weekly sentiment negative.

**Key Levels:** 31.46 (Support/Stopping Volume Low), 34.50 (Supply Peak)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Strong up bar from 31.46 on increased volume (Long setup)
- **Invalidation:** Break below 31.46
---
### AZN (BULLISH WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BULLISH, and both monthly/weekly signals are WATCH_FOR_TEST after Stopping Volume. NOTE: The volume spike on the last bar (RelVol 19.38) is anomalous compared to prior weeks (potentially due to data error or extreme event like stock split/corporate action, must be treated with caution). Assuming the spike reflects genuine interest: a massive volume bar (wide spread, CLV 0.83) occurred on 2026-02-02, reversing a deep prior weekly low (93.02). This explosive move, even if technically difficult to interpret due to the context, strongly suggests Stopping Volume and potential accumulation, especially since the close is high. If confirmed, this is a clear change of character.

**Key Levels:** 93.02 (Major Accumulation Support), 192.89 (Supply Peak)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 191.13 (Previous high on volume)
- **Invalidation:** Break below 177.86 (Previous low after reaction)
---
### BABX (NEUTRAL/BEARISH WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BEARISH, and the monthly status is WATCH_FOR_TEST after Supply Dominance. The weekly chart shows a very wide, volatile trading range (41.81 to 53.34). Week 2026-01-26 was a strong down bar on high volume, closing near the low (CLV -0.88), indicating supply. The last bar (2026-02-02) is a wide spread down bar on very low volume (RelVol 0.31), closing mid-range (CLV -0.33). The low volume downside suggests weak follow-through but also poor demand engagement near the lows. We are testing the lower end of the recent range.

**Key Levels:** 41.81 (Immediate Support), 53.34 (Supply Peak)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 41.81 on volume (Short setup)

### BANC (NEUTRAL/BEARISH WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Monthly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the monthly status is confirmed strong Buying Climax, indicating strong distribution. The weekly chart shows tight action near the top of the range. Week 2026-01-19 was a down bar on higher volume, closing near the low (CLV -0.96), a classic SOW/Upthrust confirmation. The last bar (2026-02-02) is an up bar on high relative volume (1.01), but closing mid-range (CLV -0.27). High volume without significant upward progress often indicates supply still active. Given the monthly climax, the downside pressure is dominant.

**Key Levels:** 19.40 (Immediate Support), 21.61 (Supply Peak)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 19.40 on volume (Short setup)
- **Invalidation:** Close above 21.09
---
### BBIO (NEUTRAL/BULLISH WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BULLISH, and the weekly status is confirmed early Stopping Volume. The high volume down bar on 2026-01-12 followed by consolidation suggests absorption. The last bar (2026-02-02) is an up bar on very low volume (RelVol 0.23), closing high (CLV 0.04). Low volume on an up move is usually a concern, but in the context of Stopping Volume, it can signify a low-volume test before a markup phase. Price action is tight and holding the accumulation range.

**Key Levels:** 70.94 (Stopping Volume Low/Support), 81.32 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 79.94 on increased volume (Long setup)
- **Invalidation:** Break below 76.25
---
### BBT (NEUTRAL/BULLISH WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Monthly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the monthly sequence is confirmed early Buying Climax. The weekly chart is mostly bullish consolidation. The last bar (2026-02-02) is an up bar on low volume (RelVol 0.48), closing high (CLV 0.52). While the monthly climax suggests caution, the price is currently showing local strength and good control on the up move. We should wait to see if the recent high (29.78) is rejected with volume, or if the markup continues, overriding the monthly warning.

**Key Levels:** 29.78 (Recent High/Supply), 28.18 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 29.78 on increasing volume (Long setup)
- **Invalidation:** Break below 28.18
---
### BBWI (NEUTRAL/BEARISH WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Monthly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the monthly status is confirmed early Supply Dominance. Weekly action shows consolidation after a small supply indication on 2026-01-19 (down bar, higher volume, low CLV -0.13). The last bar (2026-02-02) is a down bar on very low volume (RelVol 0.24), closing mid-range (CLV -0.31). Low volume selling into support (21.54) suggests a possible test. Given the monthly supply, the bias shifts to bearish if this low volume test fails and the price breaks lower.

**Key Levels:** 21.54 (Immediate Support), 23.72 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 21.54 on volume (Short setup)
- **Invalidation:** Close above 23.13
---
### BE (BULLISH WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BULLISH. The weekly status is WATCH_FOR_TEST after Stopping Volume. The last three weeks are complex. 2026-01-26 showed high volume selling, but the close was mid-range (CLV -0.03). The last bar (2026-02-02) is a very wide spread up bar on low volume (RelVol 0.35), closing high (CLV 0.48). This low effort, high result suggests weak opposition above the 147.00 low. Given the overall volume profile (large accumulation volume in January), this looks like a weak test/minor reaction rally that could lead to continuation of the underlying bullish quarterly trend.

**Key Levels:** 147.00 (Immediate Support), 176.49 (Recent High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 176.49 on volume (Long confirmation)
- **Invalidation:** Break below 147.00
---
### BEP (NEUTRAL/BULLISH WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Monthly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the monthly status is confirmed early Supply Dominance. Weekly action is consolidative/upward sloping. The last bar (2026-02-02) is a narrow spread up bar on low volume (RelVol 0.36), closing high (CLV 0.24). This is showing low effort to push the price up near the recent highs. While this may suggest lack of demand, the price is still trending upwards within a bullish quarterly environment, putting pressure on the monthly supply level (30.71).

**Key Levels:** 30.71 (Recent High/Supply), 29.57 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 30.71 on increased volume (Long setup)
- **Invalidation:** Break below 29.57
---
### BFH (BULLISH WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BULLISH, and the weekly status is WATCH_FOR_TEST after Stopping Volume. The heavy selling on 2026-01-12 (wide spread down, high RelVol 2.26, high CLV 0.86) suggests accumulation/stopping volume near 67.77. The last bar (2026-02-02) is an up bar on low volume (RelVol 0.51), closing high (CLV 0.20), successfully rallying above the previous week's close. This suggests the market is recovering from the recent selling climax/shakeout. The low volume indicates low supply remaining after the test.

**Key Levels:** 67.77 (Stopping Volume Low/Support), 77.79 (Recent High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 74.26 (Resistance) on increased volume (Long setup)
- **Invalidation:** Break below 71.80
---
### BHP (NEUTRAL/BULLISH WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BULLISH. The weekly status is WATCH_FOR_TEST after a Buying Climax (2026-01-26: high volume, wide spread, but poor close, CLV -0.67). This indicates supply entering the market near 74.98. However, the last bar (2026-02-02) is a strong up bar on low volume (RelVol 0.53), closing very high (CLV 0.96). This low effort, high result bar suggests the supply has temporarily dried up and demand is in control, attempting to override the climax warning. Given the strong bullish quarterly trend, the odds favor continuation if the supply fails to follow through.

**Key Levels:** 74.98 (Supply Peak), 68.73 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 74.98 on increased volume (Long setup)
- **Invalidation:** Break below 68.73
---
### BKSY (NEUTRAL/BULLISH WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Monthly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the monthly status is confirmed early Buying Climax, suggesting distribution risk. Weekly action shows consolidation near recent highs. 2026-01-26 was a wide spread down bar on slightly higher volume (RelVol 0.89), closing near the low (CLV -0.91), indicating supply. The last bar (2026-02-02) is an up bar on low volume (RelVol 0.35), closing very high (CLV 0.94). This indicates a successful low-volume test and suggests the supply was short-lived or absorbed. The close is strong, favoring the bullish quarterly trend.

**Key Levels:** 21.79 (Immediate Support), 29.79 (Supply Peak)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 23.78 on volume (Long setup)
- **Invalidation:** Break below 21.79
---
### BNS (NEUTRAL/BEARISH WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the weekly sequence shows early confirmed Supply Dominance. The week 2026-01-05 was a strong down bar on very high volume (RelVol 1.88, CLV -0.60), confirming supply entry. Price rallied weakly back up, testing the high (76.55) on 2026-01-26, which saw a down close on high volume (CLV -0.58). This failure suggests supply is still present. The last bar (2026-02-02) is an up bar on low volume (RelVol 0.41), closing high (CLV 0.45), indicating a weak reaction rally into the recent resistance zone (75.77).

**Key Levels:** 74.23 (Immediate Support), 76.55 (Supply Peak)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 74.23 on volume (Short setup)
- **Invalidation:** Close above 75.77
---
### CADE (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Watch for Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the weekly status is WATCH_FOR_TEST after Supply Dominance. Week 2026-01-26 saw extreme volume (RelVol 4.79) with a sharp drop, closing mid-range (CLV -0.48). This massive volume indicates either accumulation (stopping volume) or supply absorption. However, the preceding week (2026-01-19) was an exceptionally weak bar (CLV -0.98). The last bar is not provided in the weekly sequence. Based on the major SOW on high volume (2026-01-19, 2026-01-26), the immediate bias is bearish, as the high volume reaction failed to produce a strong up close.

**Key Levels:** 41.59 (Immediate Support/Selling Climax Low), 46.74 (Supply Peak)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 41.59 (Short setup) or strong reversal on volume (Long setup)
- **Invalidation:** Close above 44.86
---
### CAI (NEUTRAL/BEARISH WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the weekly sequence is confirmed early Stopping Volume (2026-01-12 high volume down bar, CLV -0.03, followed by consolidation). Weeks 2026-01-19 and 2026-01-26 were strong downside bars, confirming that supply is currently dominant despite the stopping volume signal. The last bar (2026-02-02) is a narrow spread up bar on low volume (RelVol 0.66), closing near mid-range (CLV -0.09). This low-effort rally confirms weakness after the aggressive selling. The trend is moving away from the bullish quarterly context.

**Key Levels:** 22.54 (New Low/Support), 26.85 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 22.54
- **Invalidation:** Close above 25.00
---
### CALM (NEUTRAL/BULLISH WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the weekly sequence shows early confirmed Supply Dominance (2026-01-05). Price dropped sharply but recovered strongly in the next two weeks. The last bar (2026-02-02) is an up bar on low volume (RelVol 0.40), closing high (CLV 0.42). This suggests low supply present (No Supply) during the rally and continuation of the underlying bullish trend, overcoming the initial supply shock from early January. Demand appears to be gently reasserting itself.

**Key Levels:** 86.02 (Recent High), 83.19 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 86.02 on volume (Long confirmation)
- **Invalidation:** Break below 83.19
---
### CALX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BEARISH, and the weekly sequence shows early confirmed Supply Dominance. Week 2026-01-26 was a massive down bar on high volume (RelVol 2.84), closing near the low (CLV -0.93), a clear SOW/markdown confirmation. The last bar (2026-02-02) is an up bar on moderate volume (RelVol 0.80), closing very high (CLV 0.95), suggesting a potential automatic rally/reaction. However, this reaction is likely a pause in the markdown rather than a reversal, given the extremely strong supply signal just prior.

**Key Levels:** 44.70 (Immediate Support), 53.88 (Immediate Resistance/Supply)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 44.70 (Short setup)
- **Invalidation:** Close above 48.20
---
### CBRL (NEUTRAL/BULLISH WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Monthly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the monthly status is confirmed early Supply Dominance. The weekly chart is volatile. The major reaction down on 2026-01-19 (CLV -0.87) suggests supply entering. However, the last bar (2026-02-02) is an up bar on low volume (RelVol 0.40), closing high (CLV 0.63). This low-effort move with a high result suggests low selling pressure (No Supply) and a high probability of continued upward movement, likely completing a low-volume test of the selling range.

**Key Levels:** 32.67 (Recent High/Supply), 29.70 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 32.67 on volume (Long setup)
- **Invalidation:** Break below 29.70
---
### CBSH (NEUTRAL/BULLISH WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Monthly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the monthly status is confirmed early Supply Dominance. Weekly action is tight consolidation. Week 2026-01-19 was a down bar on volume (CLV -0.85), indicating supply. The last bar (2026-02-02) is an up bar on low volume (RelVol 0.51), closing mid-range (CLV 0.25). This move on low volume suggests a quiet rally after a pullback. Given the underlying bullish quarterly trend, this appears to be a typical low volume test within a trading range, anticipating future demand.

**Key Levels:** 54.33 (Recent High), 52.34 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 54.33 on volume (Long setup)
- **Invalidation:** Break below 52.34
---
### CCOI (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Watch for Test (Monthly Buying Climax)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly bar (Jan) showed wide spread up on high volume (Buying Climax, CLV 0.735), signaling Smart Money distribution. The last weekly bar closed down in the lower half of the spread (CLV -0.473) on low relative volume (RelVol 0.337), suggesting demand may be weakening. The move is currently testing the prior demand zone established in January. Given the monthly climax, weakness is expected until a successful test occurs.

**Key Levels:** 25.55 (High of last monthly bar, potential supply), 23.78 (Recent Low/Demand Support), 22.26 (Key weekly support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Bullish: A clear 'No Supply' or 'Test in a Rising Market' signal around 23.78 level on low volume. Bearish: Breakdown below 23.78 on high volume.
- **Invalidation:** 23.78 (Break below confirms distribution)
---
### CIVI (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar (1/26) showed ultra-high volume (RelVol 2.71) with a wide spread up, but the close was in the lower half (CLV -0.421). This volume is a clear sign of a Buying Climax or major supply entering the market, halting the uptrend. The subsequent bar (2/2) is not provided, but the signal confirms the sequence of a potential reversal. The Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the weekly supply signal is strong. The prior monthly bar (Jan) showed wide spread up on high volume but closed near the high (CLV 0.048), suggesting underlying strength met by supply.

**Key Levels:** 29.20 (Buying Climax high/Supply), 26.64 (Support from 1/26 bar low), 27.52 (Open of the climax bar)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short: Close below 26.64 on increasing volume. Long: Successful Test of 26.64 on low volume.
- **Invalidation:** 29.20 (Close above indicates continued markup)
---
### CMPO (NEUTRAL/WATCH FOR ACCUMULATION)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The current weekly bar (2/2) is a down bar closing in the lower half (CLV -0.417) on lower volume (RelVol 0.70). However, the preceding action (1/26) was an aggressive down move on high volume (RelVol 1.479), which suggests supply. The weekly algorithm flagged Stopping Volume (1/19) due to the wide spread up on high volume which didn't follow through (Effort No Result). The move down from 1/12 high (25.95) is corrective. Given the quarterly bullish trend, this weakness might be a shakeout/re-accumulation phase. The last bar is not a convincing test.

**Key Levels:** 25.95 (Recent high/Supply), 23.00 (Recent low/Immediate Support), 20.15 (Long-term support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Bullish: A confirmed No Supply or Test of 23.00. Bearish: Break below 23.00.
- **Invalidation:** 23.00 (Break below signals continuation of markdown)
---
### CNXC (NEUTRAL/BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Weekly - Bearish Context)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH. The weekly action shows extreme volatility. The bar of 1/26 was a strong push down (Spread 7.37) closing near the low (CLV -0.637) on high volume (RelVol 1.20). The last bar (2/2) is a narrow spread up bar, but the close is near the low (CLV -0.861), indicating weakness despite the effort. The low volume (RelVol 0.638) suggests lack of major demand stepping in yet. The 'Stopping Volume' signal is tentative in a strong bearish context unless confirmed by accumulation signs (like a clear spring or automatic rally).

**Key Levels:** 40.00 (Immediate Resistance), 37.11 (Immediate support/Low of 2/2), 35.66 (Key low from 1/26)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short: Break and close below 37.11 (Confirming the weak close of 2/2). Long: Strong demand confirmation above 40.00.
- **Invalidation:** 40.00 (Close above suggests strong reversal)
---
### CORT (NEUTRAL/BEARISH WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Weekly) / Buying Climax (Monthly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly chart signaled a confirmed Buying Climax (Jan CLV -0.084 on high volume). The weekly bar of 1/26 showed ultra-wide spread (10.26) on high volume, but closed in the middle/lower half (CLV -0.401), marking supply entry. The last weekly bar (2/2) is a narrow spread up bar closing in the middle (CLV -0.186) on very low volume (RelVol 0.568). This low volume suggests a weak attempt to rally following the large supply bar. This appears to be a weak reaction in a distribution phase following a climax.

**Key Levels:** 47.06 (Climax high/Supply), 39.63 (Immediate Support), 36.79 (Key support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short: Weakness confirmed by breaking 39.63 on increasing volume. Long: Clear sign of absorption/No Supply Test near 39.63.
- **Invalidation:** 47.06 (Close above suggests continuation of markup)
---
### CRBG (NEUTRAL/BEARISH WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BEARISH, but price has been consolidating sideways in the weekly chart. The last bar (2/2) showed a wide spread down, closing near the low (CLV -0.698) on low relative volume (RelVol 0.312). This weakness suggests Smart Money may be stepping out, or there is just no demand present. The preceding bar (1/26) was an up bar with low volume, suggesting a weak rally (Effort No Result). The monthly chart signaled a Buying Climax in December (CLV -0.321 on ultra-high volume). The current action supports the bearish quarterly trend.

**Key Levels:** 31.50 (Recent Resistance), 29.80 (Immediate support), 29.35 (Key low from Jan)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short: Close below 29.80 on volume increase. Long: Strong demand confirmation above 31.50.
- **Invalidation:** 31.50 (Close above invalidates immediate short setup)
---
### CTRA (NEUTRAL/BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH. The weekly action shows a very strong uptrend. The bar 1/26 was a strong up bar closing near the high (CLV 0.796) on high volume (RelVol 1.128). The last bar (2/2) confirms this strength with a strong close (CLV 0.773) on high volume (RelVol 1.226). This sequence is flagged as a Buying Climax, typically indicating a potential reversal, however, the strong closes suggest demand is still in control and the markup is continuing, possibly entering an 'Effort > Result' phase soon, but not yet reversed. High volume at high prices needs vigilance.

**Key Levels:** 29.13 (Recent high/Supply), 27.00 (Immediate Support), 28.48 (Prior resistance now support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Long: Entry on a pullback to 28.00 showing low volume. Short: Break below 27.45 on high volume.
- **Invalidation:** 27.45 (Close below suggests distribution is active)
---
### CVS (NEUTRAL/BULLISH WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH, but the recent weekly action is highly volatile. The week of 1/26 saw an ultra-wide spread down bar (Spread 13.30) on Ultra-High Volume (RelVol 2.33), closing near the low (CLV -0.424). This is Supply Dominance, but the extreme volume suggests potential emotional selling or transfer of ownership (Stopping Volume). The subsequent bar (2/2) is a strong up bar closing near the high (CLV 0.965) on low volume (RelVol 0.444). This successful close on low volume, immediately following a possible stopping bar, suggests demand is now easily driving the price up. This structure resembles a Preliminary Stop/Automatic Rally.

**Key Levels:** 84.00 (Major Supply), 73.40 (Stopping Volume Low/Support), 76.89 (Resistance from 2/2 high)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Long: Confirmed Test of 73.40 (if price pulls back). Short: Break and close below 73.40.
- **Invalidation:** 73.40 (Break below confirms continuation of markdown)
---
### FER (NEUTRAL/BEARISH WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Monthly Supply Dominance (Bearish Context)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the monthly chart shows confirmed Supply Dominance (Dec CLV -0.971 on high volume). The recent weekly bars are quiet and narrow. The last bar (2/2) is a narrow spread bar closing in the middle/low half (CLV -0.294) on very low volume (RelVol 0.259). This action suggests low demand and quiet accumulation or, given the monthly Supply Dominance, a weak rally before another leg down. The narrow spread and low CLV are inconclusive for reversal, keeping the risk of markdown active.

**Key Levels:** 68.86 (Immediate Resistance), 67.84 (Immediate support), 67.02 (Key support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Long: Move above 68.86 on volume. Short: Close below 67.84 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** 67.02 (Close below suggests bearish continuation)
---
### FFIN (NEUTRAL/BULLISH WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the weekly sequence confirms Supply Dominance (1/26 showed wide spread down, CLV -0.502 on high volume). This suggests distribution/supply entering the market. However, the latest weekly bar (2/2) is a strong up bar closing near the high (CLV 0.720) on very low volume (RelVol 0.593). This is a strong rebound with ease, potentially marking a spring or a successful test of the prior supply zone. The bullish quarterly trend supports the idea that this is re-accumulation/shakeout.

**Key Levels:** 33.66 (Recent high/Supply), 31.69 (Immediate Support), 31.21 (Key low from 1/26)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Long: Break above 33.66, or successful test of 32.50 on low volume. Short: Close below 31.21.
- **Invalidation:** 31.21 (Break below invalidates bullish thesis)
---
### FFIV (NEUTRAL/BEARISH WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Monthly Stopping Volume (Bearish Context)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH. The monthly chart shows a potential Stopping Volume signal (Jan CLV -0.140 on high volume). The weekly bar 1/26 was an ultra-wide spread up (Spread 42.13) on high volume (RelVol 1.66), but the close was near the middle (CLV -0.346), indicating strong supply met strong demand (Effort vs. Result). The last bar (2/2) is a wide spread down closing in the middle/low (CLV -0.597) on very low volume (RelVol 0.385). The low volume suggests low demand continuation after the clash, reinforcing the potential weakness from the big 1/26 bar.

**Key Levels:** 303.98 (Major Supply), 272.00 (Immediate Support), 285.06 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short: Close below 272.00 on increasing volume. Long: Move above 285.06 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** 272.00 (Break below confirms distribution)
---
### FHB (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the weekly sequence shows supply creeping in. The bar 1/26 was a strong down bar (CLV -0.552) on high volume (RelVol 1.96). This is a strong indication of supply. The subsequent bar (2/2) is a narrow spread bar closing in the middle/high (CLV 0.039) on low volume (RelVol 0.620). This lacks conviction but is not a continuation of the selling pressure. This suggests potential testing or pause after the shakeout.

**Key Levels:** 28.11 (Immediate Resistance), 26.10 (Key low from 1/26), 25.89 (Swing low support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Long: Confirmed No Supply/Test around 26.10. Short: Close below 26.10.
- **Invalidation:** 26.10 (Break below suggests failure of demand)
---
### FIBK (NEUTRAL/BULLISH WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Monthly Buying Climax (Bearish Context)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH. The monthly chart showed a Buying Climax (Jan CLV -0.461 on high volume). The weekly bars show high volatility. The bar 1/26 was a wide spread down bar closing near the low (CLV -0.940) on high volume (RelVol 1.002), confirming supply. The last bar (2/2) is a strong rebound up bar closing near the high (CLV 0.652) on low volume (RelVol 0.575). This is likely a successful Test of the supply area, suggesting demand has absorbed the selling pressure.

**Key Levels:** 38.41 (Recent high/Supply), 35.38 (Key low from 1/26), 37.56 (Immediate close support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Long: Break and close above 38.41. Short: Close below 35.38.
- **Invalidation:** 35.38 (Break below confirms distribution)
---
### GE (NEUTRAL/BULLISH WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BULLISH. The week of 1/19 showed strong supply entry: ultra-wide spread down (Spread 33.80) closing near the low (CLV -0.775) on Ultra-High Volume (RelVol 1.96). This is a strong sign of Smart Money distribution/shakeout. The subsequent bar (1/26) was a strong up bar (CLV 0.906) on high volume (RelVol 1.64), suggesting demand immediately absorbed the selling. The last bar (2/2) is a high close (CLV 0.561) on low volume (RelVol 0.487). This confirms ease of movement up following the test of supply/shakeout. Market remains bullish but needs to overcome the major supply high of 1/12.

**Key Levels:** 328.09 (Supply high), 301.02 (Immediate support/Low of 2/2), 290.07 (Key Shakeout Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Long: Break and close above 312.43 (2/2 high). Short: Close below 301.02.
- **Invalidation:** 301.02 (Close below suggests failure of demand)

### GKOS (NEUTRAL/BEARISH WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Monthly Buying Climax (Bearish Context)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BULLISH. Monthly signal shows a Buying Climax (Jan CLV 0.401 on high volume). The weekly action is highly volatile, suggesting a trading range or distribution. The last bar (2/2) is a down bar closing in the middle (CLV -0.354) on ultra-low volume (RelVol 0.199). Low volume on a down bar suggests a weak test of demand, or simply a lack of interest, often preceding a movement in the path of least resistance (down, in a distribution context).

**Key Levels:** 128.84 (Recent Resistance), 116.42 (Immediate Support), 118.26 (Immediate Resistance/Prior Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short: Close below 116.42. Long: Move above 121.74 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** 116.42 (Break below confirms supply is active)
---
### GNTX (NEUTRAL/BULLISH WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Monthly Supply Dominance (Bullish Context)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BULLISH. Monthly chart shows Supply Dominance (Jan CLV -0.463 on high volume). The weekly sequence shows minor weakness (1/12 and 1/26 down bars). The last weekly bar (2/2) is an up bar closing in the upper half (CLV 0.519) on low volume (RelVol 0.617). This indicates ease of movement up and potential markup continuation, suggesting the recent selling was merely a shakeout/test within the bullish context.

**Key Levels:** 24.28 (Recent high/Resistance), 22.78 (Immediate Support), 23.34 (Key support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Long: Close above 24.28. Short: Close below 22.78.
- **Invalidation:** 22.78 (Break below suggests failure of demand)
---
### HDB (NEUTRAL/BULLISH WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH. However, the last weekly bar (2/2) showed a wide spread up, closing in the middle/high (CLV 0.252) on high volume (RelVol 0.970). This move follows a period of heavy selling (1/5 ultra-wide spread down on ultra-high volume). The high volume on the up bar suggests potential accumulation/stopping volume taking effect. The recent lows (32.08) are holding.

**Key Levels:** 34.46 (Immediate Resistance), 32.08 (Immediate Support), 32.66 (Resistance test area)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Long: Close above 34.46. Short: Close below 32.08.
- **Invalidation:** 32.08 (Break below confirms continuation of markdown)
---
### HPE (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Monthly - Bearish Context)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH. The monthly chart shows confirmed Strong Stopping Volume (Jan CLV -0.333 on high volume). The weekly action shows consolidation following the aggressive selling. The last bar (2/2) is an up bar with a wide spread, but the close is mediocre (CLV -0.242) on low volume (RelVol 0.267). This suggests a weak reaction or an unconvincing push higher after the stopping action. Price is currently trapped between 21.35 and 22.48.

**Key Levels:** 22.48 (Immediate Resistance), 21.35 (Immediate Support), 21.02 (Key support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Long: Close above 22.48 on strong volume. Short: Close below 21.35.
- **Invalidation:** 21.35 (Break below suggests distribution continuation)
---
### HUM (NEUTRAL/BULLISH WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH. The week of 1/26 showed an extreme Supply Dominance bar: ultra-wide spread down (Spread 77.69) closing near the low (CLV -0.901) on Ultra-High Volume (RelVol 3.14). This could be climatic selling or liquidation. The subsequent bar (2/2) is a strong up bar closing near the high (CLV 0.894) on low volume (RelVol 0.569). This is a textbook Automatic Rally (AR) following a potential Selling Climax (SC). The current structure suggests the potential start of an accumulation phase.

**Key Levels:** 193.41 (Immediate Resistance/AR High), 186.00 (SC Low/Immediate Support), 264.85 (Prior support resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Long: Confirmed Test (Secondary Test - ST) near 186.00 with low volume. Short: Break below 186.00.
- **Invalidation:** 186.00 (Break below confirms continuation of markdown)
---
### IMAX (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Monthly Stopping Volume (Bearish Context)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH. The monthly chart shows Stopping Volume (Jan CLV -0.293 on high volume). The weekly action is range-bound. The last bar (2/2) is an up bar closing in the upper half (CLV 0.664) on ultra-low volume (RelVol 0.277). This suggests demand is easily pushing the price up, indicating a weak test of the lower range (Accumulation). This is a subtle bullish sign against the bearish quarterly trend.

**Key Levels:** 37.86 (Recent Resistance), 34.60 (Immediate Support), 33.71 (Key low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Long: Close above 37.86. Short: Close below 34.60.
- **Invalidation:** 34.60 (Break below suggests failure of demand)
---
### INVH (NEUTRAL/BULLISH WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Weekly/Monthly - Confirmed Strong)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH. Both weekly and monthly charts signal Stopping Volume, indicating Smart Money entering to absorb supply. The last weekly bar (2/2) is a narrow spread bar closing slightly up (CLV 0.025) on low volume (RelVol 0.692). This suggests a passive market reaction following the buying action in the prior weeks. The low volume suggests a successful test of demand and/or lack of selling pressure.

**Key Levels:** 27.78 (Immediate Resistance), 25.58 (Key Stopping Volume Low/Support), 26.12 (Support from 1/26 bar)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Long: Strong move above 26.75 on volume, or a low volume Test of 25.58. Short: Close below 25.58.
- **Invalidation:** 25.58 (Break below invalidates accumulation thesis)
---
### IREN (NEUTRAL/BULLISH WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Monthly Supply Dominance (Bullish Context)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH. The monthly chart signaled supply dominance (Jan CLV 0.228, high volume). The weekly action shows high volatility. The bar 1/26 was an ultra-wide spread (11.80) down bar, closing in the low half (CLV -0.668) on Ultra-High Volume (RelVol 1.22), confirming significant supply or a shakeout. The last bar (2/2) is a wide spread up bar closing in the upper half (CLV 0.563) on low volume (RelVol 0.402). This suggests a quick absorption and successful Test of the shakeout low. The bullish context supports re-accumulation.

**Key Levels:** 63.59 (Major Supply), 51.78 (Key Shakeout Low/Support), 55.72 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Long: Break above 55.72 on increasing volume, or a clear 'No Supply' test near 52.35. Short: Close below 51.78.
- **Invalidation:** 51.78 (Break below suggests failure of demand)
---
### JPM (NEUTRAL/BULLISH WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH. The weekly action shows significant volatility. The week of 1/19 was a strong down bar (CLV -0.834) on high volume (RelVol 1.005), confirming supply. However, the last bar (2/2) is an up bar with a wide spread, closing near the high (CLV 0.813) on low volume (RelVol 0.479). This low volume successful move up suggests a strong absorption of supply (reversal). Given the volatility, this could mark the beginning of a trading range/accumulation.

**Key Levels:** 316.23 (Immediate Resistance), 301.37 (Immediate Support), 296.51 (Key low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Long: Close above 316.23. Short: Close below 301.37.
- **Invalidation:** 301.37 (Break below confirms continuation of markdown)
---
### KYMR (NEUTRAL/BULLISH WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Monthly Buying Climax (Bearish Context)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH. The monthly chart signaled a Buying Climax (Dec CLV -0.281 on ultra-high volume). Price has been consolidating sideways. The last weekly bar (2/2) is a strong up bar closing near the high (CLV 0.562) on ultra-low volume (RelVol 0.302). This indicates demand is easily pushing the price higher, suggesting a successful absorption of supply and a potential accumulation structure forming against the prevailing bearish trend.

**Key Levels:** 78.91 (Recent high/Next target), 71.18 (Immediate Support), 69.41 (Key low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Long: Break and close above 78.91. Short: Close below 71.18.
- **Invalidation:** 71.18 (Break below suggests distribution continuation)
---
### NICE (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Monthly Supply Dominance (Bearish Context)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH, confirmed by the monthly Supply Dominance (Jan CLV -0.933). The weekly action shows consolidation. The week of 1/26 was a strong down bar (CLV -0.926) on average volume (RelVol 0.939), confirming strong supply entry. The last bar (2/2) is an up bar closing in the upper half (CLV 0.623) on low volume (RelVol 0.667). This suggests a strong rebound off the low, likely testing the supply that came in on 1/26. This hints at potential accumulation within the trading range.

**Key Levels:** 109.62 (Immediate Resistance), 106.22 (Immediate Support), 117.21 (Major supply)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Long: Break and close above 109.62. Short: Close below 106.22.
- **Invalidation:** 106.22 (Break below confirms distribution continuation)
---
### OTIS (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH. The weekly action shows significant supply entering the market. The bar 1/26 was an ultra-wide spread down (Spread 7.64) closing near the low (CLV -0.629) on Ultra-High Volume (RelVol 2.10), confirming strong Supply Dominance. The subsequent bar (2/2) is a strong up bar closing high (CLV 0.693) on low volume (RelVol 0.591). This suggests a strong Automatic Rally or successful absorption/reversal attempt. The overall structure implies a trading range/accumulation phase starting after the severe selling.

**Key Levels:** 91.65 (Major Supply), 84.00 (Stopping Volume Low/Support), 87.50 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Long: Confirmed Test (ST) near 85.28 on low volume. Short: Close below 84.00.
- **Invalidation:** 84.00 (Break below confirms markdown continuation)
---
### OZK (NEUTRAL/BULLISH WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH. The week of 1/19 showed strong supply entry: wide spread down (Spread 3.91) closing near the low (CLV -0.913) on Ultra-High Volume (RelVol 2.05). This is a strong shakeout/Supply Dominance. However, the last bar (2/2) is a strong up bar closing in the upper half (CLV 0.551) on ultra-low volume (RelVol 0.462). This suggests demand is easily propelling the price higher, successfully absorbing the supply. The bullish quarterly context supports continued markup after this shakeout.

**Key Levels:** 49.72 (Recent high/Next target), 46.99 (Immediate Support), 45.64 (Key shakeout low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Long: Break and close above 49.72. Short: Close below 46.99.
- **Invalidation:** 46.99 (Close below suggests distribution is active)
---
### PB (NEUTRAL/BULLISH WATCH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH. The week of 1/26 showed a wide spread down (Spread 8.13) closing near the middle (CLV -0.044) on Ultra-High Volume (RelVol 2.38). This is a classic Stopping Volume or Preliminary Supply signal. The subsequent bar (2/2) is an up bar closing in the middle/high (CLV 0.386) on lower volume (RelVol 0.718). This rebound suggests demand absorbed the selling pressure. The structure indicates a potential Spring/Test action at the low 65.12.

**Key Levels:** 73.26 (Immediate Resistance), 68.07 (Immediate Support), 65.12 (Key low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Long: Confirmed No Supply/Test near 68.07, or a decisive break above 73.26. Short: Close below 65.12.
- **Invalidation:** 65.12 (Break below invalidates bullish thesis)
---
### PGY (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Demand (Failed Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly context is SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The last weekly bar shows a narrow spread, low volume (RelVol: 0.51), and a close near the middle/low (-0.42 CLV), following heavy selling pressure (last month had very wide spread, high volume, and close near the low, CLV -0.92). This low volume on the last bar is characteristic of No Demand, indicating institutional interest to the downside is currently low, but the overall trend is bearish. The failed attempt to rally after the supply shows weakness.

**Key Levels:** Support: 17.72 (Recent Low), Resistance: 20.91 (Previous Open/Minor Resistance), Major Resistance: 26.80 (High of high volume range)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and sustain below 17.70 on confirmation volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 21.00
---
### PSN (NEUTRAL/BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Demand / Low Volume Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the monthly sequence is SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The last weekly bar shows low volume (RelVol: 0.289) and a narrow spread closing in the middle/low (-0.17 CLV). This follows two wider spread down weeks (Jan 19, Jan 26) on higher volume. The low volume suggests a lack of buying interest (No Demand) into the current support area, but also low institutional selling (Test). Given the existing monthly supply dominance, the low volume at this level suggests Smart Money is not stepping in to buy yet, favoring the downside if selling returns.

**Key Levels:** Support: 67.20 (Last week's low), Minor Resistance: 70.00, Major Resistance: 74.63 (Recent High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Confirmation of supply by breaking 67.00, or confirmed demand volume above 70.00.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 72.80
---
### PYPL (NEUTRAL/BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
PYPL is in a severe BEARISH_TREND, marked by SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The last weekly bar shows an extremely wide spread (12.01) and extremely high volume (RelVol 2.036), closing near the low (CLV -0.955). This is a classic Selling Climax (SC). The volume surge indicates panic selling by weak holders and aggressive absorption by Smart Money. While the immediate close is bearish, this massive input of volume suggests a potential turning point (accumulation).

**Key Levels:** SC Low: 41.43, Immediate Resistance: 52.06, Confirmation Zone: 57.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A subsequent Test (low volume down move) toward 41-45 area, or strength above 53.50.
- **Invalidation:** Sustain below 41.00
---
### QQQI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Weakness after Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
QQQI is in a BULLISH_TREND but the monthly context is BUYING_CLIMAX (CONFIRMED_EARLY). The last two weeks show a reduction in buying interest. The last week featured low relative volume (0.516) and a narrow spread closing near the low (CLV -0.32), following a wide spread bar the week prior on high volume (RelVol 1.13) that failed to hold its gains (CLV -0.51). This pattern suggests that Smart Money is distributing near the highs, and the low volume on the last bar is a 'No Demand' sign indicating weakness.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 54.67 (Buying Climax High), Support: 53.08 (Last week's low), Confirmation Break: 52.15 (Monthly low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and sustain below 53.00 with confirming volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 54.70
---
### RGLD (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Potential Test after Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the monthly sequence shows a SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (CONFIRMED_EARLY) triggered by the wide-spread, high-volume down move on Jan 26 (RelVol 1.12, CLV -0.80). The last weekly bar is narrow spread on significantly low volume (RelVol 0.47), closing near the middle/high (CLV 0.025). This low volume action is a potential Test of supply. The lack of follow-through selling confirms sellers are currently absent, but the buyers haven't initiated a strong mark-up yet.

**Key Levels:** Support: 255.38 (Last week's low), Supply Zone: 265.00 - 275.00, High Volume Resistance: 299.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and sustain above 275.00 with increased volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 255.00
---
### RKT (NEUTRAL/BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Potential Accumulation/Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly chart showed a massive wide spread down move on high volume (Jan 01, RelVol 2.22, CLV -0.75), indicating institutional selling climax/supply dominance. However, the last weekly bar exhibits a wide spread up-close (CLV 0.521) on low volume (RelVol 0.59). This suggests the aggressive selling has stopped, and Smart Money has initiated a preliminary rally. The volume is low relative to the wide spread, meaning less effort was needed to move the price up, often an early sign of strength (SOS) after a major shakeout.

**Key Levels:** Support: 17.05 (Recent Low/Selling Climax), Immediate Resistance: 21.20, Breakout Zone: 23.50

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A low volume pullback to 19.50, or a break above 21.20.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 17.00
---
### RVMD (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Weakness Confirmed after Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
RVMD's monthly trend shows BUYING_CLIMAX (WATCH_FOR_TEST) following an explosive rally in early January (Jan 5 high volume, wide spread up). The previous week (Jan 26) saw a high volume, wide spread down bar (RelVol 1.49), closing near the low (CLV -0.05), indicating heavy distribution/supply absorption. The last weekly bar is narrow spread on very low volume (RelVol 0.334), closing near the low (CLV -0.42). This low volume indicates a lack of interest from buyers to support the price (No Demand), confirming the selling pressure initiated by the Buying Climax.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 101.93, Support: 94.89 (Last week's low), Major Support: 92.50

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and sustain below 94.89 with confirming volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 98.65
---
### RYAAY (NEUTRAL/BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume Test (Failure)

**Smart Money Logic:**
RYAAY shows a confirmed STOPPING_VOLUME sequence weekly. The wide spread, high volume down bar on Jan 26 (RelVol 1.99) suggested significant institutional selling. The last weekly bar is a narrow spread down-close (CLV -0.60) on low volume (RelVol 0.49). This price action (low volume down move) usually suggests a Test of supply. However, the close near the low of the bar indicates that even minimal volume led to price deterioration, suggesting residual weakness or a failed test to push higher. This is bearish against the general market bullish trend.

**Key Levels:** Support: 70.33 (Last week's low), Immediate Resistance: 71.36 (Previous high), Weakness Zone: Below 70.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and sustain below 70.00.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 71.50
---
### RYN (NEUTRAL/BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume Test (Failure)

**Smart Money Logic:**
RYN confirmed STOPPING_VOLUME weekly, signaled by the wide spread down bar on huge volume on Jan 26 (RelVol 3.72). The last weekly bar is a narrow spread down-close (CLV -0.228) on high volume (RelVol 0.84), which is still higher than average. The negative close on decent volume indicates that selling pressure is still overcoming buying efforts, despite the prior Stopping Volume signal. The close near the low suggests Smart Money is not yet interested in sustaining a rally.

**Key Levels:** Support: 22.33 (Last week's low), Immediate Resistance: 23.50, Major Resistance: 24.82 (Prior high)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a definitive low volume up bar or a break above 23.00.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 22.30
---
### SARO (NEUTRAL/BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence is SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (WATCH_FOR_TEST), triggered by the high volume, wide spread down bar on Jan 26 (RelVol 4.29, CLV -0.91). This was a significant shakeout. The last weekly bar is narrow spread on low volume (RelVol 0.85), closing near the middle/low (CLV -0.019). This low volume action is a clear 'No Demand' signal at the current level, confirming the institutional apathy after the distribution/shakeout. Price action is weak.

**Key Levels:** Support: 29.89, Immediate Resistance: 31.20, Major Supply: 34.48

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for confirmed strength above 31.20 or breakdown below 29.80.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 31.50
---
### SATS (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Weakness after Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
SATS is in a BULLISH_TREND but the monthly context is BUYING_CLIMAX. The bar on Jan 26 was a wide spread down move on high volume (RelVol 1.78), closing near the low (CLV -0.67), indicating heavy supply entry. The last weekly bar is a wide spread up move (CLV -0.36) on low volume (RelVol 0.56), failing to close strongly. The low volume means the attempted rally required little participation, but the weak close suggests the heavy supply from the prior week immediately stifled the move. This is Effort No Result to the upside, confirming underlying weakness.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 122.99, Support: 111.06 (Recent Low), Major Support: 109.57

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and sustain below 111.00.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 123.00
---
### STAA (NEUTRAL/BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Confirmed Stopping Volume / Failed Rally

**Smart Money Logic:**
STAA confirmed STOPPING_VOLUME weekly, suggesting accumulation. However, the last weekly bar is a narrow spread down bar on low volume (RelVol 0.41), closing near the low (CLV -0.34). This suggests that the bullish effort following the potential SC (Jan 05) has failed. The low volume down move could be a Test, but the weak close indicates that sellers (even residual ones) are still controlling the price movement down, suggesting a failed rally attempt and the risk of continuing the quarterly BEARISH_TREND.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Support: 17.74 (Last week's low), Immediate Resistance: 19.00, SC Level: 18.67

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a confirmed Sign of Strength above 19.00.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 17.70
---
### TRU (NEUTRAL/BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Severe Selling Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly sequence is STOPPING_VOLUME (CONFIRMED_EARLY), suggesting major accumulation is starting. The last weekly bar saw a massive spread down (Spread 12.50) on low volume (RelVol 0.67), closing near the extreme low (CLV -0.97). The wide spread and extreme low close signals panic selling, possibly a final shakeout, despite the relatively lower volume. Given the broader monthly context of Stopping Volume, this is likely the climactic ending action, rather than fresh supply.

**Key Levels:** SC Low: 67.39, Immediate Resistance: 78.79, Confirmation Zone: 81.70

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A sharp, low volume recovery, or a Test toward 67.50 level.
- **Invalidation:** Sustain below 67.00
---
### UGI (NEUTRAL/BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Weakness after Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
UGI's weekly sequence is BUYING_CLIMAX (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The Jan 26 bar was wide spread up on huge volume (RelVol 2.19) but closed near the middle/low (CLV -0.029), indicating major supply absorption (BC). The last weekly bar is narrow spread, low volume (RelVol 0.35), closing near the low (CLV -0.57). This is a No Demand signal following the climactic buying, confirming that Smart Money is likely distributing and supporting the price has ceased.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Support: 39.75, BC High: 41.34, Confirmation Break: 38.95

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and sustain below 39.70.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 41.35
---
### UNH (NEUTRAL/BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax / Shock Reaction

**Smart Money Logic:**
UNH is in a BEARISH_TREND quarterly. The Jan 26 bar was an extreme wide spread down on massive volume (RelVol 2.97), closing near the low (CLV -0.82). This is a clear Selling Climax (SC), likely due to major negative news (shock event). The last weekly bar is narrow spread on low volume (RelVol 0.48), closing weakly (CLV -0.05). The low volume indicates that the immediate panic selling is over, and the market is testing the new low. The price action here suggests the downside momentum has stalled, pending confirmation of accumulation.

**Key Levels:** SC Low: 280.40, Immediate Resistance: 290.40, Confirmation Zone: 331.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Low volume rally above 290.40, or a successful low volume Test near 280.40.
- **Invalidation:** Sustain below 280.00
---
### USIG (NEUTRAL/BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence is SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (WATCH_FOR_TEST). This is an extremely tight, low-volatility ETF. The last weekly bar shows a very narrow spread on low volume (RelVol 0.65), closing near the middle/low (CLV -0.11). Given the prior week's down-close on higher volume (Jan 26), the current 'No Demand' signal indicates institutional apathy and a lack of immediate buying follow-through, confirming the low volume sell-off/test. Neutral due to low volatility, but weakness is implied.

**Key Levels:** Support: 51.65 (Last week's low), Resistance: 51.83 (Last week's high)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 51.65 with increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 51.84
---
### VONG (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply / Low Volume Down Bar

**Smart Money Logic:**
VONG is in a BEARISH_TREND weekly (SUPPLY_DOMINANCE), but the monthly is STOPPING_VOLUME, creating a conflict. The last weekly bar is a narrow spread down bar on low volume (RelVol 0.49), closing near the low (CLV -0.44). This is a weak Test, indicating a lack of buying interest (No Demand) at this level. The fact that the price deteriorated on low volume suggests institutional support is absent, favoring the continuation of the short-term weekly supply.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Support: 117.18 (Last week's low), Immediate Resistance: 120.00, Major Resistance: 123.60

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and sustain below 117.10.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 119.50
---
