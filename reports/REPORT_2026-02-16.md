---

- **Invalidation:** 32.90

## 👀 Watch/Monitoring
### AAP (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

- **Invalidation:** 65.20
---
### ABT (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

- **Invalidation:** 74.02

- **Invalidation:** 37.49
---
### AEVA (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

- **Invalidation:** 148.77
---
### AON (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
Extremely high volume (2.95x) on a large down move. While some buying likely happened at the 304 level, the trend is too aggressively down to call a bottom without a test.

- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for 'Test' on low volume
- **Invalidation:** 304.59

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 60.34
- **Invalidation:** 68.51
---
### ASML (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
Extremely large spreads and volume at historical highs. RelVol 1.96 on the initial break followed by declining volume on the recent bar suggests 'No Demand' at the peak.

### BANC (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
Monthly sequence confirms a climax. While the weekly volume spiked on Feb 2nd, the subsequent week showed a weak close (CLV -0.52) on average volume, suggesting demand is drying up after the initial surge.

- **Invalidation:** 19.40

### BCE (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Higher low confirmation at 25.20
- **Invalidation:** 24.90
---
### BCS (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
Massive volume spike (RelVol 2.04) on the most recent week following a move down. While the close was weak, the sudden surge in volume suggests large-scale absorption of sell orders.

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A low-volume test of the 24.50-25.00 area
- **Invalidation:** 24.30
---
### BE (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
High volume selling has entered the market. The last two weeks show high volume with increasingly weak closes (CLV -0.49 and -0.39). Smart money appears to be distributing into the retail demand spike.

- **Invalidation:** 151.00

---
### BFH (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
High volume on the drop last week (RelVol 1.00) offset the previous week's gains. The low CLV (-0.73) suggests that while there was stopping volume previously, supply has re-entered the market.

**Key Levels:** 71.28, 72.37, 79.93

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Stability above 73.00 on low volume
- **Invalidation:** 71.20
---
### BKKT (BEARISH)

- **Entry Trigger:** Short below 9.70
- **Invalidation:** 11.67

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short below 19.00
- **Invalidation:** 22.43
---

- **Invalidation:** 125.18
---
### BRBR (BEARISH)

- **Entry Trigger:** Short on retracement to 71.00
- **Invalidation:** 73.51
---
### BROS (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Volume exploded (RelVol 3.00) as the price crashed through previous support. The lack of recovery at the end of the week suggests sellers are not finished.

**Key Levels:** 49.94, 53.20, 59.83

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short below 49.90
- **Invalidation:** 57.00
---
### BRZE (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
Price is trying to find a floor with high relative volume (2.17), but the close is still quite low. We need to see a high-volume reversal bar or a low-volume test to confirm smart money support.

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Reclaim of 18.00 on high volume
- **Invalidation:** 16.20
---
### BSX (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
Incredible volume (RelVol 3.4 and 1.8) on the massive drop. While the closes are low, volume of this magnitude at the bottom of a move usually signals a massive 'transfer of ownership' from weak hands to smart money.

**Key Levels:** 72.69, 74.73, 76.37

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Successful test of 72.70 on low volume
- **Invalidation:** 72.60
---
### BTI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
After a strong rally, massive volume has appeared (RelVol 1.92) with a very low CLV (-0.68). This is institutional selling into retail demand.

**Key Levels:** 59.06, 59.50, 61.86

#### Action Plan

- **Invalidation:** 61.00

- **Entry Trigger:** Short below 60.00
- **Invalidation:** 70.08

- **Invalidation:** 19.47
---
### BX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
The high volume on the Feb 2nd drop (RelVol 2.44) confirms that the previous rally was a climax. Supply is now in control, and price is making lower highs and lower lows on high volume.

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short on weak retracement to 134.00
- **Invalidation:** 136.50
---
### BXP (NEUTRAL)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Test of 58.00 on low volume
- **Invalidation:** 57.50

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Reversal bar above 25.00
- **Invalidation:** 24.10
---
### CADE (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Extreme volume (RelVol 4.79) on a move down. Smart money is dumping shares at an unprecedented rate. Bearish trend is strongly confirmed.

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short below 41.50
- **Invalidation:** 42.90
---
### CAI (BEARISH)

**Key Levels:** 20.42, 20.62, 23.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short below 20.40
- **Invalidation:** 22.00
---
### CART (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
The volume spike on the latest week (RelVol 2.10) after a series of down bars looks like absorption/stopping volume rather than a climax. CLV moved from -0.77 to neutral, showing a change in behavior.

**Key Levels:** 32.73, 36.30, 39.70

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Higher low above 34.00
- **Invalidation:** 32.70
---
### CBRE (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short below 125.00
- **Invalidation:** 168.96
---
### CBRL (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Weekly volume is declining on a weak recovery. There is a lack of demand. The quarterly context is bullish, but VSA shows a weak short-term picture.

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Volume surge above 34.50
- **Invalidation:** 30.26
---
### CBSH (BEARISH)

- **Entry Trigger:** Short below 52.90
- **Invalidation:** 54.77

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** High volume break of 27.50
- **Invalidation:** 24.30
---
### CDE (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Volume remains very high (RelVol 1.2-2.0) on the sell-side. The market is struggling to absorb the heavy supply entering around the 22-24 area.

**Key Levels:** 20.91, 22.42, 23.71

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short below 20.90
- **Invalidation:** 23.25
---
### CHRW (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
Massive volume (RelVol 3.58) appeared on a very large down bar. This is likely a shakeout given the prior strong trend, but the neutral CLV means we need to see a test to confirm the low.

**Key Levels:** 149.36, 176.01, 203.24

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Low volume test of 160-170
- **Invalidation:** 149.36
---
### CIVI (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
Extreme volume (RelVol 2.71) on a narrow spread weekly bar indicates 'churning'—where supply meets demand. This is often seen at local tops or before major distribution.

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Clear break above 29.20
- **Invalidation:** 26.38
---
### CNXC (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

- **Invalidation:** 37.37

- **Invalidation:** 38.00
---
### CPNG (BEARISH)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short below 16.70
- **Invalidation:** 17.73
---
### CSGP (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

- **Entry Trigger:** Short below 43.80
- **Invalidation:** 49.64
---
### MIR (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
Significant volume spike on the most recent bar suggests professional buying is entering to absorb the bearish trend, but the negative CLV indicates selling pressure is not yet exhausted. Watch for a low-volume test of this range.

---
### MNDY (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

- **Entry Trigger:** Breakdown below 28.80 support.
- **Invalidation:** 33.50

- **Invalidation:** 23.32
