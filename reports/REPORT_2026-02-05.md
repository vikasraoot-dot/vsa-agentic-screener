## 🚀 Ready for Entry
### ABVX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Rally Failure

**Smart Money Logic:**
After the confirmed Buying Climax and subsequent Supply Dominance signaled by the monthly sequence, the price saw a deep sell-off. The most recent bounce (Feb 2) occurred on very low volume, signaling No Demand after a significant drop. This sets up a potential short trade.

**Key Levels:** 107.42 (Support/Spring level), 121.75 (Minor Resistance), 125.00 (Major Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below the most recent low (107.42) on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** 117.00 (Above recent high on low volume bounce)
---
### AIQ (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Weakness Confirmed / Markdown Continuation

**Smart Money Logic:**
Following the Buying Climax warning and bearish quarterly trend, the last bar confirms strong selling. A wide spread bar closing near the low on average volume signals significant supply overcoming demand, pushing the price into a markdown phase.

**Key Levels:** 48.83 (Local Support/New Low), 51.87 (Local Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below 48.83 on strong volume.
- **Invalidation:** 52.72 (High of last weakness bar)
---
### AMBA (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Continuation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stock is under confirmed supply pressure (Bearish Quarterly/Weekly Supply Dominance). The last wide spread bar down, closing poorly (CLV -0.49) on low-average volume confirms that sellers are still in control and buying efforts are failing to sustain price. Markdown phase likely continues.

**Key Levels:** 59.11 (Local Low/Support), 64.04 (Local Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 59.11 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** 65.57
---
### AMH (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Accumulation / No Supply Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
Confirmed Stopping Volume on both monthly and weekly timeframes suggests institutional absorption. The last few weeks have seen decreasing volume within a tight range, specifically testing the lows (30.13) and closing strong (CLV 0.41) on low volume. This low volume confirms reduced selling pressure, indicating 'No Supply' and preparing for a mark-up.

**Key Levels:** 30.13 (Test Support), 32.65 (Accumulation Resistance), 28.85 (SC Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Breakout above 31.55 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** 30.10 (Break below the recent low/Test)
---
### AMKR (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Distribution / Selling Pressure Confirmed

**Smart Money Logic:**
After a peak (55.17), price suffered a massive volatile reversal. The last bar shows a very wide spread down, confirming supply is forcing the price lower, despite the price briefly rallying off the absolute low (CLV -0.55). This sharp drop below the trading range (47.79 support) is a potential markdown signal.

**Key Levels:** 42.14 (Shakeout Low/Support), 48.33 (Recent Support Break)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Confirmed close below 42.14.
- **Invalidation:** 49.99
---
### APH (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Continuation / Confirmed Markdown

**Smart Money Logic:**
The failure of the rally to sustain price above 156.00 and the subsequent heavy selling on Jan 26 (VHV, wide spread, poor close) established supply dominance. The latest bar confirms extreme weakness with a very wide spread closing near the low, resulting in a new low. Smart Money is aggressively selling.

**Key Levels:** 129.39 (New Low/Support), 140.00 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below 129.39.
- **Invalidation:** 144.00 (Previous Open)
---
### ARE (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Accumulation / No Supply Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
The sharp VHV drop on Jan 26 (Shakeout) cleared weak hands. The subsequent low volume recovery (RelVol 0.57, CLV 0.28) is characteristic of No Supply, confirming institutional support remains strong in line with the bullish quarterly trend and Monthly Stopping Volume. Ready for a mark-up.

**Key Levels:** 53.14 (Shakeout Low/Support), 56.52 (Local Resistance), 59.76 (High of Range)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 56.52 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** 53.10 (Close below Shakeout low)
---
### ARES (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Major Weakness Confirmed / Selling Climax Follow-through

**Smart Money Logic:**
Following the Buying Climax warning and sharp supply signal on Jan 19, the market delivered a massive volatile bar (Feb 2). This wide spread, high volume bar closed near its low, confirming strong institutional selling pressure and establishing a new markdown phase. The prior bullish structure has been decisively broken.

**Key Levels:** 125.93 (Support/New Low), 149.02 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Confirmed break below 125.93 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** 150.63
---
### ARWR (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Upthrust After Distribution (UTAD)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stock attempted to rally (reaching 76.11) but was met with heavy supply, resulting in a very wide bar closing near the lows (CLV -0.66) on low volume. This strong reversal from the high confirms supply dominance, overriding the bullish quarterly trend. This VSA signature suggests that the mark-down phase is initiating.

**Key Levels:** 66.45 (Local Support), 76.11 (UTAD High/Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 66.45 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** 76.11
---
### AS (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Demand / Supply Continuation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The price is exhibiting persistent weakness following the monthly supply signal. The latest weekly bar attempts a modest rally but closes poorly on lower volume, signalling that institutional buyers are absent (No Demand). This suggests the markdown phase is likely to continue.

**Key Levels:** 35.18 (Local Support/New Low), 38.21 (No Demand High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 35.18 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** 38.21
---
### ASML (BEARISH (Short Term))
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Major Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
The price action confirms supply dominance has taken over the prior bullish trend (Buying Climax). The latest bar, featuring a massive spread down and a poor close on average volume, suggests strong institutional liquidation. The price is starting a deep correction or potentially a reversal.

**Key Levels:** 1316.06 (Support), 1423.00 (Recent Resistance), 1493.48 (Climax High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Confirmed close below 1316.00.
- **Invalidation:** 1453.16
---
### AVAV (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Distribution / Markdown Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
Following a large Buying Climax event (Jan 12), the stock entered a violent markdown phase, confirmed by high volume, wide spread down bars closing near the lows (Jan 19, 26). The latest weekly bar, despite the wide spread, closed mid-low, indicating strong underlying selling pressure pushing the price towards the next support.

**Key Levels:** 246.02 (New Low/Support), 287.45 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Confirmed close below 246.02 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** 287.45

### AXTA (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Accumulation / No Supply (Test Successful)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stock is in an accumulation phase (Monthly Stopping Volume). The previous supply was met by a strong up bar closing near the high (CLV 0.89) on low volume (RelVol 0.67). This is a strong indication of reduced selling pressure, signaling a favorable entry point for a long trade.

**Key Levels:** 31.45 (Test Support), 34.50 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close above 34.50 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** 31.45 (Close below shakeout low)
---
### AXTI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Upthrust Failure / Supply Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The price action confirms institutional selling (Monthly Buying Climax). The latest weekly bar attempted a significant rally (High 22.69) but was met by strong supply, resulting in a poor close (CLV -0.54) on volume. This represents a failed Upthrust, signalling further markdown is likely.

**Key Levels:** 17.58 (Local Support), 22.69 (UTAD High/Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below 17.58 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** 22.69
---
### BABX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Continuation / Weakness Confirmed

**Smart Money Logic:**
Following the strong supply event on Jan 26, the latest weekly bar maintained its weakness. A wide spread bar closing near the low (CLV -0.64) suggests supply is readily accepted. Although volume is low, the effectiveness of the selling effort confirms continued bearish pressure in line with the quarterly trend.

**Key Levels:** 39.83 (Local Low/Support), 45.70 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below 39.83 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** 46.61
---
### BBWI (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Accumulation / No Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
The price action suggests institutional accumulation is overcoming the initial monthly supply signal. The Jan 26th bar showed strength (absorption), and the latest bar is a clear No Supply Test (very low volume, narrow range, positive close). Smart Money is ready for a mark-up in line with the bullish quarterly trend.

**Key Levels:** 21.54 (Test Support), 23.73 (Resistance), 20.52 (SC Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 23.14 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** 21.54
---
### BE (BEARISH (Short Term))
**VSA Status:** Upthrust After Distribution (UTAD) / Extreme Volatility

**Smart Money Logic:**
The extreme volatility of the last bar, characterized by a massive spread and a poor close (CLV -0.37) after reaching a new local high (176.49), signals aggressive institutional liquidation. This failed rally, likely an Upthrust, dictates immediate bearish pressure, overriding the prior accumulation signal.

**Key Levels:** 134.10 (Support), 176.49 (UTAD High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below 144.00 (previous Open/Support).
- **Invalidation:** 176.49
---
### BFH (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply / Strength Confirmed

**Smart Money Logic:**
After a successful absorption effort (Stopping Volume around 68-72), the price has confirmed strength. The latest wide-spread bar closing strongly (CLV 0.56) on below-average volume indicates low supply, suggesting the path of least resistance is up and institutions are positioning for a breakout.

**Key Levels:** 71.80 (Support), 77.79 (New High/Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close above 77.79 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** 71.80
---
### BKKT (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Demand / Markdown Continuation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The high volume distribution (Buying Climax warning/Jan 19) has led to a sharp markdown. The latest bar closed near the low on extremely low volume (RelVol 0.29). This is textbook No Demand, confirming institutional interest is absent at this level and sellers remain in control.

**Key Levels:** 11.36 (New Low/Support), 13.00 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below 11.36 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** 13.00
---
### BP (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Strength/Absorption Confirmed

**Smart Money Logic:**
The price action demonstrates absorption of prior supply weakness. The last weekly bar closed strongly near the high (CLV 0.72) on average volume, setting a new high. This indicates Smart Money is aggressively buying into the rally, confirming continuation of the bullish quarterly trend.

**Key Levels:** 37.29 (Support), 39.51 (New High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close above 39.51 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** 37.29
---
### BRBR (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Confirmation / Markdown Continuation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The high volume, wide spread bar closing weakly (CLV -0.59) confirms strong institutional selling, overriding the prior Stopping Volume signal and aligning with the bearish quarterly context. The stock is initiating a deep markdown phase.

**Key Levels:** 20.12 (New Low/Support), 25.06 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Confirmed close below 20.12 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** 25.06
---
### BSX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax / Extreme Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
This bar is a textbook example of panic and major institutional liquidation. Very High Volume on an extremely wide down bar, closing almost at the absolute low, signifies overwhelming supply pressure. This confirms the bearish quarterly trend is accelerating into a markdown phase.

**Key Levels:** 75.00 (New Low/SC Low), 93.15 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a low volume bounce (No Demand) below 80.00, then enter short on weakness. Or confirmed close below 75.00.
- **Invalidation:** 94.18
---
### BSY (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Continuation / Weakness Confirmed

**Smart Money Logic:**
The price has broken support and confirmed weakness with the major supply event on Jan 26. The latest volatile bar failed to produce significant upward momentum, closing weakly on average volume. This confirms the bearish markdown phase is continuing, aligned with the quarterly trend.

**Key Levels:** 30.97 (New Low/Support), 35.32 (Local Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below 30.97 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** 35.32
---
### BWIN (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Continuation / Markdown

**Smart Money Logic:**
The confirmed supply dominance led to a sharp markdown (Jan 26). The current bar continues this weakness, closing in the lower half of the wide range on average volume. Institutional sellers are maintaining control, pushing the price toward the quarterly lows.

**Key Levels:** 19.88 (New Low/Support), 22.92 (Local Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below 19.88 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** 22.92
---
### CADE (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result Down / Major Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
The price action peaked after reaching a high (46.74) and subsequently saw an extreme volume bar (RelVol 4.79) with only an average spread and a weak close. This classic 'Effort No Result Down' signals massive institutional selling/distribution, despite the bullish quarterly context. Markdown is confirmed.

**Key Levels:** 41.59 (Local Support/SC Low), 44.50 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Confirmed close below 41.59 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** 43.58
---
### CAI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Weakness Confirmed / Markdown Continuation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The strong bearish trend is confirmed by the sustained weakness across high volume bars (Jan 26) and the latest bar's extremely poor close (CLV -0.89) on average volume. Institutional selling is pushing the price lower, negating the prior Stopping Volume signal.

**Key Levels:** 21.72 (New Low/Support), 23.99 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Confirmed close below 21.72 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** 22.86 (Previous Open)
---
### CALX (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax followed by Strength/Absorption

**Smart Money Logic:**
The aggressive selling on Jan 26 was immediately reversed by a high volume, wide spread up bar closing strongly (CLV 0.88). This strong demand, absorbing the panic selling, confirms institutional interest near 44.00, suggesting the start of a robust rally or accumulation phase, despite the quarterly bearish trend.

**Key Levels:** 44.25 (SC Low/Support), 50.64 (Local Resistance), 55.00 (Previous Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close above 50.64 on high volume.
- **Invalidation:** 44.25
---
### CBSH (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply / Strength

**Smart Money Logic:**
Despite the Monthly Supply Dominance warning, the latest action shows strength. The price closed strongly near the high on below-average volume (No Supply). This confirms prior selling pressure has eased, suggesting the price is preparing to test the range highs (56.06) soon.

**Key Levels:** 52.35 (Support), 54.81 (Immediate Resistance), 56.06 (Range High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close above 54.81 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** 52.35
---
### CIVI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Effort No Result (Down)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence is marked as a BUYING_CLIMAX. The last bar shows extremely high volume (RelVol 2.71) on a wide spread bar that closes weakly near the low (CLV -0.42). This is classic Effort No Result (Down), indicating heavy selling (distribution) occurred on the aggressive upward move. Smart Money is distributing into the strong hands of the public, suggesting a significant reversal is likely.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 29.20 (High of climax bar), Support: 26.64 (Low of climax bar), Major Support: 25.37

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $26.64 (low of the last down move).
- **Invalidation:** $29.20 (Above the high of the climax bar)
---
### CORT (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Upthrust After Climax (Weak Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly and weekly sequences confirm a BUYING_CLIMAX. The last bar is wide spread up, closing in the middle/low (CLV -0.49), indicating supply is active, following a week of massive spread and high volume distribution (2026-01-26). The rally on 2026-02-02 lacks the requisite volume (RelVol 0.74) to sustain the upward movement past the recent distribution zone, signifying a weak re-test of supply. This confirms the CONFIRMED_EARLY status of Stopping Volume (or Selling Climax/Buying Climax transition), favoring a reversal.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 47.06 (Climax High), Immediate Resistance: 42.26, Support: 39.42 (Last Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $39.42 (Last Low) on confirming volume.
- **Invalidation:** $42.26 (Above recent pivot high)
---
### FFIN (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort Up / Markup Continuation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence previously showed SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (2026-01-26, CLV -0.50), but the latest bar negated this. The last bar is a wide spread up bar, closing near the high (CLV 0.80) on average volume (RelVol 0.80). This clear Effort Up result, overcoming recent supply, confirms strong demand absorption and continuation of the quarterly bullish trend. Smart Money is aggressively bidding the price higher.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 34.43 (Last High), Support: 31.69 (Last Low), Immediate Support: 32.75

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Sustained break above $34.43 or pullback to $32.75 showing No Supply.
- **Invalidation:** $31.69 (Below last swing low)
---
### INVH (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
Both Weekly and Monthly sequences confirmed STOPPING_VOLUME (S/V). The last weekly bar is a narrow/average spread down bar, closing in the middle/high (CLV 0.32) on high volume (RelVol 0.92). In the context of S/V, this down bar on high volume, closing well off the lows, often represents a successful Test where Smart Money absorbed remaining supply. The close is far from the low, suggesting demand is immediately protecting the accumulation area.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 26.92 (Last High), Support: 25.58 (Last Low/Accumulation Low), Immediate Support: 26.12

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $26.92 on volume, or confirmed No Supply (narrow spread, low volume up bar).
- **Invalidation:** $25.58 (Below Accumulation Low)
---
### PGY (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Monthly) / Effort No Result (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly sequence shows Supply Dominance, reinforced by persistent bearish movement on the weekly chart. The last two weekly bars show wide spreads down (CLV -0.83, -0.48) on relatively lower volume, suggesting markdown pressure remains effective without immediate signs of absorption. The last bar attempted a relief rally but closed poorly, showing weakness (CLV -0.48). Quarterly context is BEARISH.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 20.52 (Recent High), Support: 17.29 (Recent Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 17.29 (recent low) on increased volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 20.52
---
### RF (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Monthly) / Demand Entry (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Despite the monthly Supply Dominance warning, the latest weekly bar shows strong demand action. It was a wide spread up bar, closing near the high (CLV 0.67), on lower than average volume (RelVol 0.52). This indicates low effort for a high result, suggesting accumulation during the prior weeks has set up a bullish push. The Quarterly trend is BULLISH, supporting this move. The prior weekly bar showed a Test/Effort result (CLV 0.76).

**Key Levels:** Support: 28.36 (Last Week's Low), Resistance: 30.84 (Recent High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 30.84 (recent high).
- **Invalidation:** Close below 29.50 (mid-point of the last up bar)
---
### RGTI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Monthly) / Markdown Continuation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly chart flagged a Buying Climax, suggesting a reversal from the recent high prices. The weekly chart confirms this bearish bias. The last two bars show strong markdown (spreads of 6.15 and 2.14) with low closes (CLV -0.82 and -0.10). Volume dropped significantly on the last bar (RelVol 0.30), indicating markdown is occurring with less effort, consistent with a lack of demand. The quarterly context is BEARISH.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Support: 16.23 (Last Week Low), Resistance: 18.37 (Recent High/Open)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 16.23 on increased volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 18.37
---
### RLI (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Monthly) / Effort For Result (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly chart shows Supply Dominance, but the weekly chart is showing signs of strength. The last weekly bar was a strong UP bar (wide spread, CLV 0.67) on average volume (RelVol 0.61). This 'Effort for Result' upward move suggests demand is overcoming recent supply, pushing the price higher efficiently. This counter-trend move may lead to a test of higher resistance.

**Key Levels:** Support: 58.15 (Last Week Low), Resistance: 61.56 (Recent High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 61.56.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 58.15
---
### RTO (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (WATCH_FOR_TEST)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The prior week (2026-01-26) showed a wide spread down, closing poorly, but the volume (RelVol 1.36) was high, suggesting potential absorption/Stopping Volume, even though the close was weak. The latest bar (2026-02-02) is a medium spread UP bar closing near the high (CLV 0.69) on above-average volume (RelVol 1.47). This is confirmation of demand entering the market and overcoming the recent supply, setting up a bullish reversal (Accumulation). Quarterly trend is BULLISH.

**Key Levels:** Support: 31.28 (Stopping Volume Low), Resistance: 33.45 (Recent High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 32.68 (Last High) or 33.45.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 31.28
---
### RYAAY (NEUTRAL/BULLISH INITIATION)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (CONFIRMED_EARLY) / High Volume Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BEARISH, but a strong counter-trend move might be starting. The week of 2026-01-26 was a strong UP bar on very high volume (RelVol 1.99), closing near the high (CLV 0.61). This signifies high demand overwhelming supply (Stopping Volume). The latest bar (2026-02-02) is a narrow spread bar, closing poorly (CLV -0.18), but volume dropped significantly (RelVol 0.64). This narrow, low-volume bar in the accumulation area is a classic 'Test' for supply, suggesting Smart Money bought the pullback.

**Key Levels:** Support: 70.13 (Test Low), Resistance: 71.36 (High before Test)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 71.36 (Confirmation of demand continuation).
- **Invalidation:** Close below 70.13
---
### SA (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Monthly) / Climactic Supply (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BEARISH, and the monthly confirmed Supply Dominance. The week of 2026-01-26 showed extreme weakness (wide spread down, high volume, CLV -0.97). The last bar (2026-02-02) attempted a relief rally (wide spread up) but closed poorly in the middle (CLV 0.28) on lower volume. This relief effort failed to close strong, suggesting Smart Money is selling into the rally. The underlying structure remains bearish.

**Key Levels:** Support: 27.40 (Last Low), Resistance: 30.75 (Last High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 27.40 on above-average volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 30.75
---
### SARO (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (WATCH_FOR_TEST)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Despite the BULLISH quarterly trend, the weekly chart shows clear distribution. The week of 2026-01-26 was a massive supply bar: wide spread down, high volume (RelVol 4.29), closing near the low (CLV -0.91). This confirms major selling by Smart Money. The last week (2026-02-02) was a narrow spread down bar on lower volume (RelVol 1.25, still high absolute volume), closing poorly (CLV -0.29). This suggests supply is still in control, but the intensity is slightly reduced after the climactic bar.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Resistance: 31.19 (Last High), Supply Zone: 33.45

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 29.19 on increased volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 31.19
---
### SATS (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Monthly) / Climactic Selling (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly chart flagged a Buying Climax, signaling a reversal from the prevailing BULLISH quarterly trend. The week of 2026-01-26 was climactic selling: huge spread down, very high volume (RelVol 1.78), closing near the low (CLV -0.67). This is major distribution. The last weekly bar (2026-02-02) was a wide spread down bar, closing poorly (CLV -0.55), confirming the follow-through of supply, albeit on lower volume (RelVol 0.84).

**Key Levels:** Immediate Support: 107.12 (Last Low), Resistance: 122.98 (Prior High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 107.12 on follow-through volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 115.00
---
### STAA (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (CONFIRMED_STRONG)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BEARISH, but strong accumulation signals are emerging. The last two weekly bars show potential accumulation efforts. The bar prior (2026-01-26) was low volume (RelVol 0.75) narrow spread down (No Demand). The latest bar (2026-02-02) showed a wide spread down, closing near the low (CLV -0.87) on low volume (RelVol 0.62). Despite the poor close, the low volume indicates supply exhaustion in the markdown area, confirming the Stopping Volume status from prior action. This points toward a reversal attempt from Smart Money.

**Key Levels:** Support: 17.44 (Stopping Volume Low), Resistance: 19.00 (Last High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 19.00 on volume, confirming demand takes control.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 17.44
---
### TFX (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (WATCH_FOR_TEST) / Demand Surge

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BEARISH, but strong demand signals are emerging. Following two weeks of strong supply (2026-01-12, 2026-01-26), the last weekly bar (2026-02-02) was a strong wide spread UP bar, closing almost at the high (CLV 0.95) on above-average volume (RelVol 1.06). This signifies a strong demand surge, potentially absorbing the prior supply. This is a counter-trend sign of strength (SOS).

**Key Levels:** Support: 101.65 (Last Low), Resistance: 106.08 (Recent High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 106.08.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 103.00 (Prior weekly close)
---
### TXT (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (WATCH_FOR_TEST) / Demand Entry

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BULLISH. The prior week (2026-01-26) saw significant selling (wide spread down, high volume, low close, CLV -0.34). The latest bar (2026-02-02) was a strong UP bar, closing very high (CLV 0.75) on above-average volume (RelVol 1.00). This strong upward momentum indicates demand has stepped in decisively to absorb the prior week's supply, maintaining the overall bullish trend and suggesting a successful Test/SOS.

**Key Levels:** Support: 86.36 (Last Low), Resistance: 91.34 (Recent High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 91.34.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 86.36
---
### UNH (BEARISH (Extreme Weakness))
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (WATCH_FOR_TEST) / Selling Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BEARISH. The week of 2026-01-26 was extreme capitulation/distribution: massive volume (RelVol 2.97), huge spread down, closing near the low (CLV -0.82). The latest bar (2026-02-02) continues the weakness with a wide spread down bar, closing poorly (CLV -0.77) on lower but still substantial volume (RelVol 0.75). There is no sign of absorption. Supply remains completely dominant.

**Key Levels:** Climactic Low: 274.04, Immediate Resistance: 290.39 (Last High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 274.04.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 286.92 (Prior weekly close)
---
### USIG (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (WATCH_FOR_TEST) / No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly chart has shifted to Supply Dominance (2026-01-12 and 2026-01-26 showing pressure). The last bar (2026-02-02) is a very narrow spread down bar, closing slightly poorly (CLV -0.30) on low volume (RelVol 0.92). Given the general market choppiness, this structure in a high-base consolidation looks like a potential No Demand bar, leaving the price vulnerable to markdown.

**Key Levels:** Support: 51.63 (No Demand Low), Resistance: 51.83 (Recent High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 51.63 on increased volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 51.83
---
### VONG (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (WATCH_FOR_TEST)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BEARISH. The monthly sequence shows Stopping Volume, suggesting potential underlying strength, but the recent weekly action is bearish continuation. The last bar (2026-02-02) was a wide spread down bar, closing poorly (CLV -0.57) on average volume (RelVol 0.94). This confirms supply pressure is driving the price down towards the monthly stopping volume area (115.66 low).

**Key Levels:** Support: 115.66 (Last Low), Resistance: 120.77 (Last High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 115.66.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 120.02 (Previous close)
---
### WGMI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Monthly) / Distribution/Climactic Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly chart flagged a Buying Climax, indicating distribution. This aligns with the weekly action: the last bar (2026-02-02) was a massive wide spread down on moderate volume (RelVol 0.85), closing poorly (CLV -0.53). This strong markdown follows a large distribution bar (2026-01-26, RelVol 1.15). The momentum is clearly bearish, confirming the climax/distribution structure.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Support: 38.36 (Last Low), Resistance: 46.61 (Last High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 38.36 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 45.06 (Previous close)
---
### WHR (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (WATCH_FOR_TEST) / Demand Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BULLISH. The week of 2026-01-26 was climactic selling (wide spread down, high volume, closing mid-range CLV 0.11), suggesting absorption occurred near the lows (72.55). The latest bar (2026-02-02) confirms demand: a wide spread UP bar, closing very strong (CLV 0.80) on average volume (RelVol 0.94). This is a strong Sign of Strength (SOS) following the Stopping Volume, signaling Smart Money has stepped in.

**Key Levels:** Support: 77.61 (Last Low), Resistance: 88.77 (Recent High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 88.77.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 79.98 (Previous close)
---
### WPM (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (WATCH_FOR_TEST) / Demand Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BULLISH. The week of 2026-01-26 was a major distribution/Stopping Volume event: massive spread down, high volume, closing near the low (CLV -0.89). However, the latest bar (2026-02-02) showed a powerful recovery: wide spread up, closing very strong (CLV 0.82) on average volume (RelVol 0.99). This represents strong demand absorption (SOS) immediately reversing the climactic selling, suggesting the markdown was successfully shaken out by Smart Money.

**Key Levels:** Support: 129.11 (Last Low), Resistance: 141.30 (Recent High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 141.30.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 131.86 (Prior close)
---
### WRB (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Monthly) / Demand Entry

**Smart Money Logic:**
Despite the monthly Supply Dominance warning, the weekly chart shows clear demand returning. The last bar (2026-02-02) was a wide spread UP bar, closing very strong (CLV 0.72) on low volume (RelVol 0.44). This is high reward for low effort, indicating absorption has been successful in prior weeks and demand is now easily driving prices higher. Quarterly trend is BULLISH.

**Key Levels:** Support: 67.25 (Last Low), Resistance: 70.65 (Recent High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 70.65.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 68.54 (Last Open)
---
## 👀 Watch/Monitoring
### ABT (NEUTRAL (Bias Bearish))
**VSA Status:** Reaccumulation/Stopping Volume Failure to Rally

**Smart Money Logic:**
The market saw a clear Selling Climax mid-January (VHV, wide spread down, low CLV). Subsequent high volume weeks failed to produce a strong upward rally, indicating continued supply. The current weekly bar shows consolidation near the lows, suggesting Smart Money is taking time, but the underlying bearish quarterly trend suggests any rally might be sold into unless a clear Test appears.

**Key Levels:** 105.27 (Support/SC Low), 111.00 (Local Resistance), 115.00 (Previous Support Zone)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a clear No Demand/Test on low volume failing below 105.27 for short entry, or a successful Test of 105.27 for long confirmation.
- **Invalidation:** 111.00
---
### ACLX (NEUTRAL (Watch for breakdown))
**VSA Status:** No Demand after Supply Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
Despite a bullish quarterly trend, the recent price action confirmed Supply Dominance (Jan 19 high volume, low CLV). The latest low volume, indecisive bar (CLV -0.05) suggests lack of demand to overcome the established selling pressure. Price is likely forming a short-term trading range/minor distribution.

**Key Levels:** 66.55 (Local Support), 70.11 (Resistance), 76.50 (Major Supply Level)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 67.70 (Open/Low) on increasing volume for short entry.
- **Invalidation:** 71.23 (Breakout above recent high on volume)
---
### ACWX (NEUTRAL (Watch for Test or Breakdown))
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax & Follow-through Weakness

**Smart Money Logic:**
The rally encountered a Buying Climax/Upthrust (Jan 26) on high volume that failed to sustain the high close. The current bar is narrow, closing weakly (-0.20 CLV) on average volume, which suggests continued supply pressure in a sensitive area. The bullish quarterly context dictates we wait for confirmation of weakness below the range or a successful high volume Test/Shakeout.

**Key Levels:** 70.49 (Support), 72.33 (Climax High/Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry upon confirmed close below 70.49. Long entry upon a successful low volume Test/Spring near 70.49.
- **Invalidation:** 72.33
---
### AEVA (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Continuation/No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
The price is under strong Supply Dominance. The last two high volume weeks (Jan 19, 26) showed deep declines. The latest bar is a low volume, narrow range bounce, indicating little institutional interest (No Demand). This suggests weakness persists and the downtrend is likely to resume.

**Key Levels:** 12.20 (Local Support), 13.55 (Local Resistance), 15.81 (Immediate Supply/Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below 12.20 on volume, confirming trend resumption.
- **Invalidation:** 13.55 (High of No Demand Bar)
---
### AGIO (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Accumulation Range / Low Volume Consolidation

**Smart Money Logic:**
After the Stopping Volume signaled on the monthly chart, the price entered a tight weekly range (26.25 - 29.93). The latest weekly volume is significantly low (0.41 RelVol), confirming smart money is inactive or consolidating supply absorption before a mark-up. Lack of clear commitment makes the setup NEUTRAL.

**Key Levels:** 26.25 (Accumulation Support), 28.71 (Local Resistance), 29.93 (High of Range)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a low volume Test or Shakeout near 26.50, followed by a breakout above 30.00 on high volume.
- **Invalidation:** 26.25
---
### AHR (BEARISH (Short Term))
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax & Supply Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The massive volume on Jan 26, which produced a wide spread but only a mid-close, indicates significant institutional selling (Selling Climax/Distribution). The subsequent week shows price closing weakly, validating the supply presence. The stock is likely starting a short-term markdown or a prolonged consolidation phase.

**Key Levels:** 46.33 (Local Support), 48.80 (Climax High/Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Confirmed close below 46.33 on above-average volume.
- **Invalidation:** 48.80
---
### AIG (NEUTRAL (Bias Bearish))
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Weak Rally (LPSY)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Following confirmed strong Supply Dominance, the recent bounce lacks the volume conviction of the prior selling phases (RelVol 0.60). The up movement may represent a Last Point of Supply (LPSY) within a larger distribution/markdown phase. Given the bearish context, selling pressure is likely to return soon.

**Key Levels:** 73.50 (Local Support), 77.52 (Local Resistance), 85.69 (Major Supply)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Confirmed close below 73.50, or a clear No Demand signal near 77.52 followed by price falling.
- **Invalidation:** 77.52
---
### ALC (NEUTRAL (Bias Bullish))
**VSA Status:** Potential Test of Stopping Volume Zone

**Smart Money Logic:**
The price is consolidating near the monthly Stopping Volume area (76.74 low). The last weekly bar successfully bounced significantly off the low (CLV 0.31) on average volume, suggesting initial demand entering the market around 77.00. Requires confirmation of strength to overcome resistance.

**Key Levels:** 76.74 (Stopping Volume Support), 82.50 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Breakout above 81.00 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** 76.74
---
### ALL (NEUTRAL (Cautious Bullish))
**VSA Status:** Weak Rally after Selling Climax (Secondary Reaction)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The price hit a potential Selling Climax low at 191.13 (VHV, low close). The subsequent rally shows good CLV, suggesting immediate demand, but the volume is decreasing relative to the selling pressure. This suggests the rally is weak and may turn into a short-term LPSY or upthrust before supply resumes. Immediate strength exists, but bearish background is dominant.

**Key Levels:** 191.13 (SC Low/Support), 208.44 (Local High), 215.00 (Major Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a low volume Test failure below 198.00 for long entry, or confirmation of supply near 215.00 for short entry.
- **Invalidation:** 198.22
---
### APLS (NEUTRAL (Bias Bearish))
**VSA Status:** Distribution / Weak Rally

**Smart Money Logic:**
The price action suggests a trading range established after a Buying Climax, consistent with the bearish quarterly context. The latest low volume rally attempt failed to reach the previous high, indicating lack of sustained institutional demand. This weakness suggests supply remains dominant above 24.00.

**Key Levels:** 21.10 (Local Support), 23.93 (Local Resistance), 19.76 (SC Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Confirmed drop below 21.10 on volume, targeting 19.76.
- **Invalidation:** 23.93
---
### ATO (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Secondary Test of Supply Zone

**Smart Money Logic:**
Following the Buying Climax signal mid-January, price dropped heavily on volume. The latest bar is a strong recovery, showing a wide spread and decent CLV. However, it occurred on only average volume and is entering the prior area of massive distribution. We need to see if this rally confirms absorption or results in a failure (Upthrust).

**Key Levels:** 164.50 (Support), 172.09 (Supply Resistance), 174.54 (New High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 174.54 on high volume for long confirmation, or a reversal bar below 172.00 on high volume for short entry.
- **Invalidation:** 164.50
---
### BAH (NEUTRAL (Bias Bullish))
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax / Potential Spring

**Smart Money Logic:**
Following the confirmed Buying Climax and subsequent high volume markdown (Jan 26), the stock hit a potential Selling Climax low at 81.15. The latest bar (Feb 2) is volatile but managed to close well above the absolute low, indicating absorption. The low volume suggests this bounce is currently a weak test, but the bullish quarterly trend supports accumulation possibility.

**Key Levels:** 81.15 (SC Low/Support), 88.42 (Immediate Resistance), 109.10 (Distribution High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 88.42 on strong volume, or a clear low volume Test near 81.50.
- **Invalidation:** 81.15
---
### BANC (NEUTRAL (Bias Bearish))
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result (Distribution)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The confirmed Monthly Buying Climax suggests distribution. The current week confirms this difficulty: high volume (RelVol 1.42) generated only a narrow, indecisive bar. This 'Effort No Result' signals Smart Money struggling to push price higher due to supply.

**Key Levels:** 19.41 (Local Support), 20.70 (Resistance), 21.61 (Range High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Confirmed close below 19.41 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** 20.70
---
### BBIO (NEUTRAL (Bias Bearish))
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Weak Response

**Smart Money Logic:**
While Stopping Volume was detected, the subsequent price action lacks commitment. The latest week is a wide bar down, closing poorly, and notably occurring on very low volume (RelVol 0.49). This weakness suggests that demand is not aggressively absorbing remaining supply, leaving the bullish setup vulnerable.

**Key Levels:** 74.32 (Local Support), 80.00 (Resistance), 70.95 (SC Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Confirmed close below 74.32 for short or a reversal bar above 77.00 on increasing volume for long.
- **Invalidation:** 70.95
---
### BBT (NEUTRAL (Cautious Bullish))
**VSA Status:** Strength but Low Volume Thrust

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stock showed strong closing action on the last weekly bar (wide spread, high CLV). However, this occurred on slightly below average volume, following a Monthly Buying Climax warning. While currently displaying strength, the lack of heavy volume to validate the push suggests potential vulnerability if supply increases rapidly around the high (30.94).

**Key Levels:** 30.94 (Resistance/New High), 28.18 (Local Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Confirmed high volume continuation above 30.94.
- **Invalidation:** 28.18
---
### BEP (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** No Demand / Consolidation Below Resistance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The low volume, narrow range bar closing slightly weak (CLV -0.35) confirms a lack of aggressive institutional follow-through after the recent rally (Jan 26). This No Demand status, in the context of Monthly Supply Dominance, suggests difficulty penetrating resistance, leading to potential weakness.

**Key Levels:** 29.58 (Local Support), 30.72 (Local Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 29.58 on volume for short, or break above 30.72 on volume for long.
- **Invalidation:** 30.72
---
### BHP (NEUTRAL (Bias Bearish))
**VSA Status:** Secondary Test of Supply / Upthrust Risk

**Smart Money Logic:**
The price is correcting after the Buying Climax signal (Jan 26). The latest up bar occurred on average volume and failed to significantly challenge the high of the supply bar (74.98). This suggests the rally is weak (No Demand Test failure), increasing the risk of an Upthrust or markdown continuation.

**Key Levels:** 68.76 (Local Support), 73.64 (Local Resistance), 74.98 (Climax High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Confirmed close below 68.76 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** 74.98
---
### BKSY (BEARISH (Short Term))
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax / Secondary Upthrust Failure

**Smart Money Logic:**
The large move down on Jan 26 was a probable Selling Climax (or major shakeout). The subsequent bar (Feb 2) showed massive volatility but failed to hold its high, closing near the middle/low, indicating strong supply entering the market again. This suggests distribution is confirmed and the subsequent rally failed.

**Key Levels:** 19.32 (SC Low/Support), 23.82 (Local Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Confirmed close below 19.32 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** 23.82
---
### BNS (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** No Demand / Consolidation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The price action is consolidating after an initial supply signal (Jan 5). The low volume and narrow spread on the last bar, combined with a weak close (CLV -0.43), suggest a lack of aggressive institutional buying (No Demand). The market is in a temporary equilibrium, but vulnerability to supply remains.

**Key Levels:** 74.23 (Local Support), 75.88 (Local Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 75.88 or below 74.23 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** 75.88
---
### BROS (BEARISH (Short Term))
**VSA Status:** Secondary Reaction / Distribution Confirmed

**Smart Money Logic:**
The break below 59.00 on massive volume (Jan 26) confirmed major supply entering the market. The latest bar is attempting a shallow recovery (CLV 0.05) on average volume. This lack of significant demand validation confirms that the high volume distribution event is dictating the short-term direction downwards.

**Key Levels:** 52.15 (SC Low/Support), 56.57 (Local Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Confirmed close below 52.15 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** 56.57
---
### CALM (NEUTRAL (Cautious Bearish))
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result Up (Supply)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The price achieved a new high (89.48) but the resulting weekly bar had a wide spread and only closed slightly above the middle on low volume. This 'Effort No Result Up' indicates that institutional buyers are not aggressively supporting the high, suggesting hidden supply is present near the high. This confirms the Weekly Supply Dominance warning.

**Key Levels:** 83.20 (Local Support), 89.48 (Supply High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Failure and close below 83.20 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** 89.48
---
### CBRL (NEUTRAL (Bias Bearish))
**VSA Status:** Weak Rally into Supply Zone

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly Supply Dominance confirmed that the price peak was met with institutional selling (Jan 19 high CLV -0.87). The latest wide-spread rally occurred on low volume (RelVol 0.60), suggesting this is a weak response and potentially a minor Upthrust setting up for a short trade, especially failing to overcome 34.43 convincingly.

**Key Levels:** 29.70 (Support), 34.43 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Confirmed reversal below 33.00 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** 34.43
---
### CCOI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Test Failure

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly Sequence indicated a BUYING_CLIMAX followed by a WATCH_FOR_TEST. The last weekly bar (2026-02-02) shows a wide spread up, but the close is near the low (CLV -0.30) and volume is high (RelVol 0.48, considering monthly context), suggesting strong supply absorbing the move. While volume isn't exceptionally high, the rejection from the high after a strong upward movement indicates supply overcoming demand, confirming the required test of the prior buying climax area, leading to potential reversal.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 25.55 (Last High), Support: 23.34 (Last Low), Major Support: 19.38 (Monthly Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $23.34 (low of supply bar) on confirming volume.
- **Invalidation:** $25.55 (Above last high)
---
### CDE (NEUTRAL (Leaning Bearish))
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Retest

**Smart Money Logic:**
The previous weeks showed significant SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (2026-01-26: wide spread down, high volume, low CLV -0.89). The latest weekly bar (2026-02-02) is a down bar with high volume (RelVol 0.96) and a weak close (CLV -0.09). This looks like a retest into the previously established supply area, but the close slightly above the open suggests a mild attempt to hold, typical of a consolidation/retest before a potential markdown continuation. Quarterly trend is bullish, but weekly structure is broken.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 22.07 (Last High), Support: 19.66 (Last Low), Supply Zone: 26.50 - 27.77

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $19.66 (Last Low) or failure to hold above $22.07.
- **Invalidation:** $22.60 (Above previous swing high)
---
### CMPO (NEUTRAL (Monitoring Accumulation))
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Failed Attempt)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence shows STOPPING_VOLUME, indicating potential accumulation starting. However, the last two weekly bars are down bars on high volume (RelVol 1.47, 1.09) with low CLV (-0.43, -0.66). The latest bar is a wide spread down, closing near the low, confirming supply is still dominant, potentially overwhelming the stopping volume detected earlier. This looks like a shakeout after initial accumulation signals.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 25.95 (Last confirmed high), Support: 21.60 (Last low), Accumulation Zone: 20.15 - 23.57

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A definitive close above $23.57 on higher volume, or a narrow spread low volume Test in the $21.60 area.
- **Invalidation:** $20.15 (Below previous strong support)
---
### CNXC (NEUTRAL (Potential Accumulation))
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Rejection

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is bearish, but the weekly sequence detected STOPPING_VOLUME. The last weekly bar (2026-02-02) is a wide spread up bar closing in the middle (CLV 0.119) on average volume (RelVol 0.87). While the CLV is weak (indicating supply stepped in at the high $40.00), the overall effect of the STOPPING_VOLUME area is holding (low $35.66). This suggests a struggle between accumulation (Smart Money buying near the low) and overhead supply (selling near $40).

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 40.00 (Last High), Support: 37.07 (Last Low), Major Support (Stopping Volume): 35.66

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close above $40.00 on strong volume, or a confirmed No Supply at $37.07.
- **Invalidation:** $35.66 (Below Stopping Volume low)
---
### CTRA (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Confirmed Strong)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence shows a CONFIRMED_EARLY BUYING_CLIMAX. The latest bar is a wide spread up bar, closing near the high (CLV 0.90) on extremely high volume (RelVol 2.04). While the close is high, the massive volume spike after a prolonged rally (following a previous climax bar on 2026-01-12) suggests a final burst of buying (Climax), where Smart Money is likely distributing heavily into public enthusiasm. The massive volume implies absorption of demand.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 30.63 (Climax High), Support: 27.43 (Last Low), Climax Area: 28.85 - 30.64

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A definitive close below $27.43 (Last Low) or a confirmed Upthrust/Test failure near $30.63.
- **Invalidation:** $30.63 (Above Climax High)
---
### FER (NEUTRAL (Leaning Bearish))
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Weakness on Rally

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly sequence detected SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The last weekly bar is a narrow/average spread up bar, closing near the low (CLV -0.51) on low volume (RelVol 0.41). This low CLV on a rally attempt indicates weakness—supply is present and pushing the close down, suggesting No Demand. This suggests the prior accumulation attempt (if any) failed and price is ready to retreat.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 69.21 (Last High), Support: 67.57 (Last Low), Major Support: 65.10

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $67.57 on confirming volume.
- **Invalidation:** $69.21 (Above last high)
---
### FFIV (NEUTRAL (Leaning Bearish))
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Upthrust After Rally (Weakness)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly sequence confirmed STOPPING_VOLUME, indicating potential accumulation in the low $250s. However, the last weekly bar is an average spread up bar, closing near the low (CLV -0.31) on very low volume (RelVol 0.54). This is a weak attempt to rally following the huge volatility bar (2026-01-26). The low CLV suggests failure at the high, indicating immediate overhead supply is still active, despite the underlying monthly accumulation signal. This is a weak re-test of supply.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 285.09 (Last High), Support: 272.00 (Last Low), Major Resistance: 303.98

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $272.00 on volume, confirming resumed markdown.
- **Invalidation:** $285.09 (Above last high)
---
### GE (NEUTRAL (Monitoring consolidation))
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Failed Test of Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly trend signals CONFIRMED_EARLY SUPPLY_DOMINANCE from the massive down move on 2026-01-19 (RelVol 1.96). The last two weeks saw attempts to rally. The last bar is a narrow/average spread up bar, closing in the middle (CLV 0.28) on average volume (RelVol 0.82). While the close is higher, the CLV suggests supply is still present near the high ($312.42), preventing a strong close. This signals consolidation/trading range after distribution, but the inability to rally decisively suggests supply remains active.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 312.43 (Last High), Immediate Support: 301.02 (Last Low), Supply Zone: 323.88 - 332.79

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $312.43 on high volume for bullish, or break below $301.02 for bearish continuation.
- **Invalidation:** Depends on directional break outside the range.
---
### GKOS (NEUTRAL (Leaning Bearish))
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Test of Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly sequence is marked as BUYING_CLIMAX (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The last bar is a wide spread down bar, closing near the middle/low (CLV -0.28) on low volume (RelVol 0.41). This low volume pullback after a series of high-volume, low-CLV weeks (2026-01-19/26) suggests a Test of Supply. However, given the prior climax and the general weakness, the low CLV on the down bar suggests demand absorption isn't strong enough yet to confirm accumulation. The bearish implications of the climax remain.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 121.74 (Last High), Support: 110.72 (Last Low), Climax High: 130.23

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Confirmed No Supply at $110.72 for bullish reversal; break below $110.72 for bearish continuation.
- **Invalidation:** $121.74 (Above last swing high)
---
### GWRE (NEUTRAL (Potential Reversal))
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Selling Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
The trend is BEARISH, reinforced by recent SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The last weekly bar is a wide spread down bar (20.24 spread), closing near the middle (CLV 0.01) on very high volume (RelVol 1.67). This combination—wide spread, high volume, and a close far off the low (relative to the wick)—suggests a Selling Climax or stopping action. Smart Money is stepping in to absorb supply, indicating potential accumulation beginning near the low $121.94.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 142.18 (Last High), Support: 121.94 (Last Low/Climax Low), Immediate Resistance: 140.76

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Confirmed No Supply at $121.94, or break above $142.18.
- **Invalidation:** $121.94 (Below Selling Climax low)
---
### HPQ (NEUTRAL (Monitoring Accumulation))
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / No Supply (Uncertain)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The trend is bearish with CONFIRMED_EARLY SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (Monthly). The last weekly bar is a wide spread up bar, closing near the middle/high (CLV 0.34) on high volume (RelVol 1.39). This bar covers a wide range, suggesting effort, but the middle close indicates supply is meeting demand (Upthrust). However, volume is not extremely climactic, suggesting absorption. Given the close is significantly higher than the low ($18.32), this might be an initial sign of accumulation, absorbing selling pressure.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 20.55 (Last High), Support: 18.32 (Last Low), Immediate Resistance: 19.66

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Confirmed No Supply test near $19.44, or a definitive break above $20.55.
- **Invalidation:** $18.32 (Below last swing low)
---
### IMAX (NEUTRAL (Monitoring accumulation/distribution))
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Weakness

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly sequence confirmed STOPPING_VOLUME. The last weekly bar is a narrow spread up bar, closing in the middle (CLV 0.17) on very low volume (RelVol 0.44). This is indicative of 'No Demand' after a rally attempt (2026-01-12 high). The inability of the market to rally decisively on low volume suggests supply is still present and effective, possibly marking a minor Upthrust in the accumulation range defined by the prior Stopping Volume.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 36.05 (Last High), Support: 34.60 (Last Low), Accumulation Low: 33.71

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $36.05 on volume, or a confirmed No Supply test near $34.60.
- **Invalidation:** $34.59 (Below last low)
---
### IONX (NEUTRAL (Potential Reversal))
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Selling Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
The trend is BEARISH, confirmed by SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The last bar is a massive spread down bar (5.48 spread), closing near the middle (CLV -0.52) on high volume (RelVol 1.17). This indicates a possible Selling Climax (SC). The wide spread and high volume suggest exhaustive selling, but the close being significantly off the low suggests immediate absorption by Smart Money. This sets up a potential accumulation range.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 16.64 (Last High/Supply Zone), Support: 11.16 (Climax Low), Immediate Support: 15.22

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Confirmed No Supply test near $11.16, or break above $16.64 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** $11.16 (Below Selling Climax low)
---
### ITT (NEUTRAL (Monitoring consolidation))
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Weakness on Rally

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly sequence confirmed SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The last weekly bar is a wide spread up bar, closing in the middle/low (CLV -0.13) on average volume (RelVol 0.90). The wide spread suggests significant effort, but the failure to close strongly (low CLV) indicates heavy overhead supply is meeting the demand. This is a clear sign of weakness in a potentially distributive phase after the strong rally into January.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 190.15 (Last High), Immediate Support: 182.30, Support: 181.32 (Last Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $181.32 on confirming volume, confirming supply dominance.
- **Invalidation:** $190.15 (Above last high)
---
### KVYO (NEUTRAL (Monitoring Accumulation))
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Upthrust After Rally

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence confirmed STOPPING_VOLUME, but the market failed to launch. The last bar is a wide spread down bar, closing near the middle (CLV -0.19) on average volume (RelVol 0.75). The CLV slightly off the low suggests some demand absorption near the bottom, but the wide spread down is concerning for accumulation efforts. This looks like a retest into the accumulation area, but requires confirmation of renewed demand.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 23.43 (Last High), Immediate Resistance: 23.82, Support: 18.92 (Accumulation/Climax Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Confirmed No Supply test near $18.92, or decisive break above $23.43.
- **Invalidation:** $18.92 (Below Accumulation Low)
---
### NYT (NEUTRAL (Potential Reversal))
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Selling Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence detected STOPPING_VOLUME. The last bar is a massive spread down bar (15.17 spread), closing in the middle/low (CLV 0.15) on extremely high volume (RelVol 1.96). This combination of wide spread and high volume strongly suggests a Selling Climax (SC). The close off the low indicates Smart Money stepped in heavily to absorb selling, signaling a potential reversal in the range.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 74.04 (Last High), Immediate Resistance: 73.31 (Previous High), Support: 58.87 (Climax Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Confirmed No Supply Test near $58.87, or decisive break above $74.04.
- **Invalidation:** $58.87 (Below Selling Climax low)
---
### PB (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (WATCH_FOR_TEST)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly chart shows Stopping Volume (high volume, wide spread, close in the upper half) on 2026-01-26, followed by a wide-spread UP bar (2026-02-02) closing strongly near the high on above-average volume (RelVol 1.038). This UP bar confirms the immediate demand presence after the stopping volume, suggesting Smart Money accumulated near the 65.12 low. The quarterly trend is BULLISH, supporting an upward move after accumulation.

**Key Levels:** Support: 65.12 (Stopping Volume Low), Resistance: 73.625 (Recent High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 73.625 or a confirmed No Supply test near 69.50.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 65.12

### PLTU (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (WATCH_FOR_TEST)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly chart is dominated by strong bearish action. The last two weeks saw massive spreads down (8.14 and 20.65) on high volume (RelVol 1.11, 1.88). The last bar (2026-02-02) was a very wide spread down bar with high volume, closing near the low (CLV -0.738). This is climactic selling, indicating intense distribution and markdown. The quarterly trend is BEARISH. We expect follow-through weakness or a test of this massive supply.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Resistance: 51.61 (Previous Open), Critical Resistance: 66.50 (Last major high)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Continuation break below 40.45, or a failed No Demand test toward 50.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 55.00 (mid-point of climactic range)
---
### PSN (NEUTRAL/WEAKENING)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Monthly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the monthly context is strong Supply Dominance. The last week (2026-02-02) showed a narrow spread down bar on very low volume (RelVol 0.47), closing poorly (CLV -0.05). This is a potential No Demand signal, suggesting the market is weak and vulnerable to further markdown within the prevailing monthly distribution context. However, the move is small and volume is minimal, indicating a lack of conviction from either side.

**Key Levels:** Support: 67.19 (No Demand Low), Resistance: 73.26 (Last significant high)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 67.19 on above-average volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 73.26
---
### PTGX (NEUTRAL/TRANSITION)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Monthly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly chart confirmed a Buying Climax, suggesting potential weakness ahead despite the recent choppy weekly action. The weekly price action is sideways (80-86 range) on decreasing volume (RelVol 0.64). The last bar closed midrange (CLV -0.09) suggesting indecision. This sideways action often precedes a mark-down when preceded by a Buying Climax.

**Key Levels:** Support: 81.00 (Weekly Low), Resistance: 86.09 (Recent High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 81.00 on high volume for short, or break above 86.09 for counter-trend long attempt.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 86.09
---
### PYPL (BEARISH (Extreme Weakness))
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (WATCH_FOR_TEST)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BEARISH, and the weekly sequence shows extreme weakness. The last week (2026-02-02) was a capitulation event: massive volume (RelVol 2.64), huge wide spread down, closing near the absolute low (CLV -0.84). This confirms intense selling/distribution. While capitulation sometimes marks a low, the strength of the selling pressure here demands caution and confirms Smart Money is exiting or shorting heavily. This high volume, low close bar is the defining trait of Supply Dominance in this markdown phase.

**Key Levels:** Support: 39.95 (Capitulation Low), Resistance: 52.68 (Previous support, now resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A break below 39.95 or a failed relief rally (No Demand) test toward 45-48.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 53.43
---
### QQQI (NEUTRAL/WEAKENING)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Monthly) / Weak Close (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The overall quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the monthly sequence flags a Buying Climax (indicating potential top formation). The last weekly bar closed poorly (CLV -0.59) on high volume (RelVol 1.05) and a wide spread, suggesting underlying weakness and distribution near the highs. This price action looks like an initial sign of supply overwhelming demand.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Support: 52.27 (Last Weekly Low), Resistance: 54.34 (Recent High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 52.27 on high volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 54.34
---
### RARE (NEUTRAL/BULLISH PULLBACK)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (CONFIRMED_EARLY)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly context is BULLISH, but both weekly and monthly sequences show Supply Dominance, signaling a strong pullback. However, the last weekly bar closed neutral (CLV near zero) on slightly lower volume (RelVol 0.77), indicating that the strong supply surge might be temporarily exhausting itself. The prior wide-spread move up (2026-01-19) on high volume suggested demand was present, but it failed to sustain. The current neutral bar suggests indecision at a potential support zone.

**Key Levels:** Support: 23.55 (Last Two Week's Low), Resistance: 25.81 (Recent High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A Test (No Supply) confirmation near 23.50, or break above 25.81.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 23.26
---
### RGLD (NEUTRAL/WEAKENING)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Monthly) / Test after Supply (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the monthly confirmed Supply Dominance. The week of 2026-01-26 showed a massive wide spread down bar on high volume, closing near the low (CLV -0.80), a major sign of distribution. The latest weekly bar (2026-02-02) is a relatively wide spread, closing midrange (CLV 0.03) on lower volume, acting as a potential test of the supply zone, but failing to show strong demand confirmation. This structure suggests a potential pause before further markdown.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Support: 255.38 (Last Week Low), Resistance: 306.25 (Supply High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 255.38 on high volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 280.00
---
### RKT (NEUTRAL/ACCUMULATION)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Monthly) / Stopping Volume (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly Supply Dominance suggests long-term selling pressure, but the last weekly bar (2026-02-02) shows potential accumulation. Following a massive down bar (2026-01-26, wide spread, high volume, low close), the last bar was a wide spread UP bar closing in the upper half (CLV 0.32), indicating strong underlying demand entered the market near the lows (17.65). Volume was decent (RelVol 0.76). This looks like Stopping Volume attempting to reverse the markdown.

**Key Levels:** Support: 17.65 (Stopping Volume Low), Resistance: 21.19 (Recent High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Confirmed No Supply test near 18.50, or break above 21.19.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 17.65
---
### RVMD (NEUTRAL/WEAKENING)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Monthly) / High Volume Selling

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly sequence indicates a Buying Climax, suggesting potential top formation after an explosive move in January. The week of 2026-01-26 showed high volume (RelVol 1.49) with a wide spread down, closing poorly (CLV -0.05). This is likely distribution. The last week (2026-02-02) was a narrow spread up bar, closing midrange (CLV 0.24) on low volume (RelVol 0.50). This low volume attempt to rally is a likely No Demand bar, confirming weakness following the distribution.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Support: 93.01 (No Demand Low), Resistance: 98.63 (Recent High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 93.01 on increased volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 98.63
---
### RYN (NEUTRAL/WEAKENING)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Monthly) / Stopping Volume (WATCH_FOR_TEST)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly chart flagged a Buying Climax, hinting at a potential top. The prior week (2026-01-26) was an aggressive wide spread down bar on massive volume (RelVol 3.72), closing poorly (CLV -0.20). This is climactic selling/distribution. The latest bar (2026-02-02) is a very narrow spread bar, closing midrange (CLV 0.35) on high volume (RelVol 1.31). This looks like a 'Test' of the supply after the climax, but the volume is still too high for a clean No Supply signal. It suggests continued battle between supply and demand.

**Key Levels:** Support: 21.89 (Climax Low), Resistance: 24.01 (Climax High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 21.89 for bearish continuation, or a strong UP bar on low volume for accumulation confirmation.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 24.01
---
### SONY (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (WATCH_FOR_TEST)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BEARISH, and the weekly chart shows consistent Supply Dominance. For three consecutive weeks, the bar has closed poorly or near the low on above-average volume, indicating persistent selling. The last bar (2026-02-02) was a narrow spread down bar, closing near the low (CLV -0.08) on high volume (RelVol 1.24). This suggests high effort for little result downward, but the close being poor maintains the bearish tone. We lack a clear absorption sign.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Support: 21.52 (Last Low), Resistance: 22.37 (Last High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 21.52 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 22.50
---
### SPOT (BEARISH (Extreme Weakness))
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (WATCH_FOR_TEST) / Selling Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BEARISH. The latest weekly bar (2026-02-02) exhibits extreme weakness: a massive wide spread down bar on above-average volume (RelVol 1.39), closing almost on the low (CLV -0.95). This is a textbook Selling Climax, confirming major panic and distribution. Although climactic action can lead to a reversal, the immediate sign is overpowering supply dominance. We wait for a clean absorption effort.

**Key Levels:** Climactic Low: 438.73, Immediate Resistance: 497.01 (Last Open)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A failed relief rally (No Demand) test toward 470, or a break below 438.73.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 500.35 (Previous close)
---
### SYF (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (CONFIRMED_EARLY) / Demand Reaction

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BEARISH, reinforced by Supply Dominance signals (2026-01-26 was a wide spread down, high volume, low close). However, the last weekly bar (2026-02-02) showed a wide spread up, closing very strong near the high (CLV 0.67) on low volume (RelVol 0.78). This is a strong demand reaction into the supply area, indicating potential absorption or a quick spring-up. If this is a spring, we expect the rally to continue.

**Key Levels:** Support: 72.22 (Spring/Low), Resistance: 75.80 (Last High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 75.80.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 72.22
---
### TRU (NEUTRAL/ACCUMULATION)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Monthly) / Selling Climax (Weekly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BEARISH, confirmed by monthly stopping volume near the low. The latest weekly bar (2026-02-02) was a massive wide spread down bar on high volume (RelVol 1.19). It closed midrange (CLV -0.41), rather than near the low. This indicates climactic selling where Smart Money absorbed supply near the lows. This bar functions as a possible Selling Climax/Stopping Volume, suggesting accumulation is occurring at depressed prices.

**Key Levels:** Climactic Low: 65.23, Immediate Resistance: 79.90 (Last High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Confirmed No Supply test near 70, or break above 79.90.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 65.23
---
### UGI (NEUTRAL/WEAKENING)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (CONFIRMED_EARLY) / High Volume Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence confirmed a Buying Climax, often marking a top or significant pullback, despite the BULLISH quarterly trend. The week of 2026-01-26 was climactic (wide spread up, very high volume, low close CLV -0.02). The last bar (2026-02-02) was a narrow spread bar, closing midrange (CLV 0.04) on low volume (RelVol 0.71). This low volume bar is a 'Test' of the supply, but the fact that it failed to rally strongly or show a clean No Supply suggests supply is still lingering after the climax.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Support: 39.75 (Test Low), Resistance: 41.34 (Climax High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 39.75 on high volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 41.34
---
### ZM (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (WATCH_FOR_TEST)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the weekly sequence flags a potential Buying Climax (2026-01-26: wide spread, high volume, mixed close). The last bar (2026-02-02) was a relatively wide spread, closing flat/midrange (CLV 0.02) on moderate volume (RelVol 1.07). The lack of strong follow-through confirms indecision after the climax. The price is currently rotating within the climax range.

**Key Levels:** Support: 87.19 (Last Low), Resistance: 94.29 (Last High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 94.29 for long continuation, or break below 87.19 for bearish distribution confirmation.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 87.19
---
## Other
### CNQ (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Upthrust

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly trend shows continued strength. The last bar is a wide spread up bar, closing near the high (CLV 0.86) on average volume (RelVol 0.85). This confirms the prior STOPPING_VOLUME signal's bullish intent by pushing through resistance. In the context of the bullish quarterly trend, this suggests continuing accumulation/markup. The previous wide spread up bar (2026-01-26, CLV 0.17) shows supply being met, but the latest bar clearly overcomes it.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 38.72 (Last High), Support: 35.80 (Last Low), Immediate Support: 37.21

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Sustained break above $38.72 or pullback to $37.21 showing No Supply.
- **Invalidation:** $35.79 (Below the last significant swing low)
---
### CPNG (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Continuation

**Smart Money Logic:**
Both Quarterly and Weekly trends are bearish, reinforced by SUPPLY_DOMINANCE signals. The last weekly bar is a down bar, wide spread, closing near the low (CLV -0.38) on average volume (RelVol 0.78). Although volume is lower than the climax bar (2026-01-26, RelVol 2.56), the consistent closure near lows indicates demand is absent, and the markdown phase is likely continuing. Smart Money is liquidating/shorting.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 20.97 (Previous High), Immediate Resistance: 20.34, Support: 19.05 (Last Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $19.05 on confirming volume.
- **Invalidation:** $20.34 (Above last minor high)
---
### CRBG (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Effort Up

**Smart Money Logic:**
Despite a Monthly BUYING_CLIMAX CONFIRMED_EARLY, the immediate weekly action is strongly bullish. The last bar is a wide spread up bar, closing near the high (CLV 0.74) on average volume (RelVol 0.52). The high CLV suggests that the effort put in was rewarded, confirming recent demand absorption. This momentum implies the monthly climax needs a more serious reaction before confirmation.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 31.41 (Last High), Support: 29.88 (Last Low), Major Resistance: 32.63 (Monthly High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $31.41 on volume, or pullback to $30.83 showing No Supply.
- **Invalidation:** $29.88 (Below last low)
---
### CSGP (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Shakeout

**Smart Money Logic:**
The trend is strongly BEARISH, marked by continuous SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The last bar (2026-02-02) is a very wide spread down bar, closing near the low (CLV -0.71) on high volume (RelVol 1.31). This confirms aggressive selling and markdown continuation. This is a severe weakness signal, indicating Smart Money is liquidating positions aggressively.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 62.67 (Last High), Support: 50.59 (Last Low), Supply Zone: 67.80 - 70.57

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $50.59 on confirming volume.
- **Invalidation:** $62.67 (Above last minor high)
---
### CVS (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / No Demand (Failed Bounce)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence is marked by CONFIRMED_EARLY SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (massive down bar on 2026-01-26, RelVol 2.33, CLV -0.42). The last weekly bar is a wide spread up bar, closing near the middle/low (CLV -0.10) on low volume (RelVol 0.74). This small reaction on diminished volume relative to the supply confirms No Demand after the major distribution event. This suggests selling pressure will resume quickly.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 77.52 (Last High), Immediate Resistance: 74.52 (Previous Close), Support: 73.40 (Last Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $73.40 (Last Low) on confirming volume.
- **Invalidation:** $77.52 (Above No Demand high)
---
### DUOL (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Markdown Continuation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is bearish, and the Monthly sequence confirms SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The last bar is a wide spread down bar, closing near the low (CLV -0.62) on high volume (RelVol 1.39). This is strong confirmation of markdown continuation. Each recent week has shown persistent selling pressure with wide spreads and poor closes, indicating Smart Money is aggressively liquidating.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 136.54 (Last High), Support: 112.41 (Last Low), Major Resistance: 155.89

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $112.41 (Last Low) on confirming volume.
- **Invalidation:** $136.54 (Above last high)
---
### ENR (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort Up / Absorption

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is bullish, but Monthly confirmed SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (early). However, the last weekly bar is a wide spread up bar, closing well off the high (CLV 0.32) on average volume (RelVol 0.92). The price pushed significantly higher, absorbing potential supply, suggesting demand is aggressive enough to overcome recent selling (2026-01-12/19). The move overcame the previous accumulation/resistance area around $22.27, suggesting markup continuation.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 24.30 (Last High), Support: 21.56 (Last Low), Key Breakout Level: 22.27

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Sustained consolidation above $22.27 followed by a break above $24.30.
- **Invalidation:** $21.56 (Below last swing low)
---
### FHB (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Failed Test of Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence detected SUPPLY_DOMINANCE on 2026-01-26 (high volume, low CLV -0.55). The latest bar (2026-02-02) is a narrow spread up bar, closing high (CLV 0.60) on average volume (RelVol 0.92). Crucially, this bar successfully closes higher than the open of the prior supply bar ($27.12), demonstrating renewed demand strength and absorption. The quarterly trend is bullish, supporting this demand surge.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 27.39 (Last High), Support: 26.01 (Last Low), Immediate Support: 26.55

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $27.39 on confirming volume.
- **Invalidation:** $26.01 (Below last swing low)
---
### FIBK (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Attempted Markup

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly sequence confirmed a BUYING_CLIMAX, but the reaction has been mixed. The last weekly bar is a wide spread up bar, closing high (CLV 0.63) on average volume (RelVol 0.70). This strong close suggests demand is reasserting itself after recent supply concerns (2026-01-26, CLV -0.94). The move strongly negates the immediate weakness, implying Smart Money is pushing price up, possibly overcoming a minor spring or shakeout.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 38.70 (Last High), Support: 35.60 (Last Low), Immediate Support: 36.66

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $38.70 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** $35.60 (Below last swing low)
---
### FISV (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Markdown Continuation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is bearish, supported by Monthly SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The last bar is a wide spread down bar, closing in the middle/low (CLV -0.35) on average volume (RelVol 0.74). The continued wide spread down, despite lower volume compared to previous weeks, confirms the persistent weakness and markdown continuation. The Smart Money is continuing to drive the price lower after clearing major support.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 63.75 (Last High), Support: 57.79 (Last Low), Major Resistance: 66.30

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $57.79 on confirming volume.
- **Invalidation:** $63.75 (Above last high)
---
### GBCI (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort Up / Markup Continuation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly sequence confirmed SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (due to volatility in prior months, but current price action is bullish). The last weekly bar is a wide spread up bar, closing high (CLV 0.74) on average volume (RelVol 1.00). This is a strong Effort Up result, pushing the price to new highs, indicating demand is fully in control and overcoming the supply detected in previous weeks (2026-01-19 CLV -0.32).

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 53.61 (Last High), Support: 50.33 (Last Low), Breakout Level: 50.68

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Sustained break above $53.61 or pullback to $50.68 showing No Supply.
- **Invalidation:** $50.33 (Below last swing low)
---
### GNTX (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Demand Surge / Markup Continuation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly sequence confirmed SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (early), but the last weekly bar is a wide spread up bar, closing high (CLV 0.76) on average volume (RelVol 0.89). This strong closure suggests immediate demand absorption, overcoming the minor weakness shown in the previous two weeks (low CLV closes). The strong move suggests Smart Money is driving the price up, likely initiating markup despite the monthly bearish context.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 25.14 (Last High), Immediate Support: 24.16 (Previous High), Support: 22.78 (Last Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $25.14 on confirming volume, or pullback to $23.93 showing No Supply.
- **Invalidation:** $22.78 (Below last swing low)
---
### HDB (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Demand Reassertion

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly trend showed SUPPLY_DOMINANCE recently (2026-01-05). The last bar is a wide spread up bar, closing high (CLV 0.57) on high volume (RelVol 1.30). This represents strong demand absorption, successfully rallying away from the low of the range and overcoming the local high. This strength suggests the bearish quarterly trend might be reversing, or at least initiating a significant rally within a broader accumulation phase.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 34.46 (Last High), Immediate Support: 33.59, Support: 32.08 (Last Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $34.46 on confirming volume, or pullback to $32.65 showing No Supply.
- **Invalidation:** $32.08 (Below last swing low)
---
### HPE (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Demand Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly sequence confirmed STOPPING_VOLUME strongly. The last weekly bar is a strong wide spread up bar, closing near the high (CLV 0.94) on average volume (RelVol 0.51). This high CLV indicates clear demand confirmation, successfully overcoming the previous range resistance ($21.52-$22.01). This confirms the success of the prior Stopping Volume and suggests Smart Money is now initiating markup.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 23.29 (Last High), Immediate Support: 21.52 (Breakout level), Support: 21.35 (Last Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Sustained consolidation above $22.00 or break above $23.29.
- **Invalidation:** $21.35 (Below last swing low)
---
### HUM (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Test of Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence confirmed SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (massive down bar on 2026-01-26, RelVol 3.14, CLV -0.90). The last weekly bar is an average spread up bar, closing near the middle/high (CLV 0.17) on high volume (RelVol 0.85). This looks like a weak rally attempt into the previous area of aggressive selling. The low CLV on this up bar suggests strong supply absorption (Upthrust/Test failure). The weakness is compounded by the bearish quarterly trend.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 196.34 (Last High), Support: 186.00 (Last Low/Climax Low), Major Supply Zone: 269.09 - 279.58

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $186.00 on confirming volume.
- **Invalidation:** $196.34 (Above the test bar high)
---
### IONQ (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Markdown Continuation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is bearish, and the Monthly sequence signalled a BUYING_CLIMAX. The last bar is a wide spread down bar, closing near the low (CLV -0.51) on average volume (RelVol 0.59). This confirms aggressive selling pressure following the climax and distribution in the range (2026-01-26). The markdown is clearly underway. Smart Money is aggressively liquidating/shorting.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 40.73 (Last High), Immediate Resistance: 39.98, Support: 33.63 (Last Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $33.63 on confirming volume.
- **Invalidation:** $40.73 (Above last high)
---
### IREN (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Markdown Continuation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly sequence signals SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The last bar is a wide spread down bar (11.81 spread), closing near the low (CLV -0.82) on high volume (RelVol 0.73). This is aggressive markdown continuation, reinforcing the weakness seen in the previous week (2026-01-26, CLV -0.66). Despite the bullish quarterly trend, immediate selling pressure is dominant and Smart Money is liquidating/shorting.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 55.72 (Last High), Immediate Resistance: 53.74, Support: 43.91 (Last Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $43.91 on confirming volume.
- **Invalidation:** $55.72 (Above last high)
---
### JPM (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Demand Reassertion

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence confirmed SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (2026-01-19, CLV -0.83). However, the last bar is a wide spread up bar, closing very high (CLV 0.77) on low volume (RelVol 0.73). This strong reversal and high CLV suggests demand is reasserting control and has successfully absorbed the prior supply push. The low volume on the up bar, following high volume down bars, can signal Markup continuation as supply has been temporarily exhausted.

### KDP (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Markup Continuation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly sequence confirmed a BUYING_CLIMAX (early). However, the last weekly bar is a wide spread up bar, closing very high (CLV 0.78) on very low volume (RelVol 0.38). This suggests a strong push higher with minimal opposition. While low volume can signal lack of conviction, in a tight range this appears to be sustained strength, possibly ignoring the prior climax warning for the short term, driving toward new highs.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 28.60 (Last High), Support: 27.20 (Last Low), Immediate Support: 27.76

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $28.60 on confirming volume.
- **Invalidation:** $27.20 (Below last swing low)

### KYMR (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Demand Surge

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly sequence confirmed a BUYING_CLIMAX, but the last weekly bar is a wide spread up bar, closing high (CLV 0.68) on low volume (RelVol 0.50). Despite the low volume, the strong close indicates easy markup. The price is aggressively moving away from the lower accumulation area (around $69), suggesting that if a distribution occurred, the subsequent shakeout was successfully overcome. The current momentum is strong to the upside.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 78.91 (Last High), Immediate Support: 74.28, Support: 71.18 (Last Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $78.91 on volume, or pullback to $72.69 showing No Supply.
- **Invalidation:** $71.18 (Below last swing low)

### LHX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Test Failure

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence is marked as a BUYING_CLIMAX. The last bar is a wide spread down bar, closing near the low (CLV -0.66) on average volume (RelVol 0.78). This confirms supply dominance. The high CLV in previous weeks (2026-01-05/19) suggests distribution took place near the $360-$370 level. The current bar is a bearish confirmation, showing Smart Money driving the price lower, unable to hold the high ground.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 355.99 (Last High), Immediate Resistance: 346.46, Support: 335.63 (Last Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $335.63 on confirming volume.
- **Invalidation:** $355.99 (Above last high)

### MOD (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Markup Continuation (VSA Climax)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly trend signals STOPPING_VOLUME (2026-01-05). The last bar is a very wide spread up bar (21.74 spread), closing high (CLV 0.42) on high volume (RelVol 1.35). While the spread is massive, the CLV is only moderate, suggesting some supply met demand near the top ($205.74). However, the move is aggressively bullish and confirms the prior Stopping Volume signal. This looks like a continuation of markup, potentially leading to a short-term Buying Climax soon, but bullish momentum is currently strong.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 205.74 (Last High), Immediate Support: 184.66 (Previous Close), Support: 184.00 (Last Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $205.74, or a No Supply pullback to $190.00.
- **Invalidation:** $184.00 (Below last swing low)

### MSFU (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Markdown Continuation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The trend is strongly BEARISH (Quarterly and Monthly SUPPLY_DOMINANCE). The last bar is a wide spread down bar (3.24 spread), closing near the low (CLV -0.50) on extremely high volume (RelVol 2.10, relative to recent volume). This indicates a sharp and aggressive continuation of the markdown phase, confirming massive liquidation by Smart Money.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 32.05 (Last High), Immediate Resistance: 30.43 (Previous Low), Support: 28.81 (Last Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $28.81 on confirming volume.
- **Invalidation:** $32.05 (Above last high)

### NET (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Markdown Continuation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence is marked as a BUYING_CLIMAX (2026-01-26, RelVol 2.78). The last bar is a wide spread down bar (22.99 spread), closing near the low (CLV -0.59) on high volume (RelVol 1.37). This severe markdown immediately following the climax confirms distribution and the successful launch of a bearish reversal. Demand is clearly overwhelmed.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 185.22 (Last High), Immediate Resistance: 177.35 (Previous Close), Support: 162.23 (Last Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $162.23 on confirming volume.
- **Invalidation:** $185.22 (Above last high)

### NFXL (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Markdown Continuation (Failed Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence confirmed STOPPING_VOLUME (S/V), but the bearish quarterly trend is dominating. The last bar is a wide spread down bar (3.43 spread), closing near the low (CLV -0.69) on average volume (RelVol 0.75). The weak close confirms supply is still dominant, likely marking a failed spring/test within the accumulation effort. The markdown is continuing, invalidating the bullish implications of the prior S/V.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 24.97 (Last High), Immediate Resistance: 23.95 (Previous Low), Support: 21.54 (Last Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $21.54 on confirming volume.
- **Invalidation:** $24.97 (Above last high)

### NICE (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Demand Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly sequence confirmed SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (early). However, the last weekly bar is a wide spread up bar, closing very high (CLV 0.88) on average volume (RelVol 0.98). This suggests strong and successful demand entry, absorbing the supply that dominated the previous week's down move (2026-01-26, CLV -0.92). This aggressive upward movement points to Smart Money initiating a significant rally or markup phase, overcoming the bearish quarterly trend resistance.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 112.99 (Last High), Immediate Support: 106.41 (Previous Close), Support: 104.72 (Last Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $112.99 on confirming volume.
- **Invalidation:** $104.72 (Below last swing low)

### OC (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Demand Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly sequence confirmed STOPPING_VOLUME. The last weekly bar is a wide spread up bar (14.12 spread), closing very high (CLV 0.93) on average volume (RelVol 0.86). This is a strong demand confirmation, pushing through recent resistance levels and closing near the high. This move successfully negates the minor supply concern from the previous week (2026-01-26, CLV -0.29) and confirms the continuation of the bullish quarterly trend.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 133.28 (Last High), Immediate Support: 125.30, Support: 119.16 (Last Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $133.28 on confirming volume.

### ONB (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Demand Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly sequence confirmed STRONG SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (early). However, the last weekly bar is an average spread up bar, closing very high (CLV 0.66) on average volume (RelVol 0.56). This strong close suggests demand is overcoming the previous supply influence, driving the price higher. Given the quarterly bullish trend, this high CLV bar suggests markup continuation and absorption of recent selling pressure.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 25.94 (Last High), Immediate Support: 24.53, Support: 24.28 (Last Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $25.94 on confirming volume.
- **Invalidation:** $24.28 (Below last swing low)

### OTIS (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Demand Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence detected SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (2026-01-26, RelVol 2.10, CLV -0.62). The last weekly bar is a wide spread up bar, closing very high (CLV 0.97) on high volume (RelVol 1.10). This is strong demand confirmation, entirely negating the prior supply bar's bearish implications. Smart Money has stepped in aggressively at the low ($84.00) and rapidly driven the price back to the previous highs. This confirms accumulation and reversal within the strong bullish quarterly trend.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 91.65 (Previous High), Immediate Support: 90.44, Support: 85.28 (Last Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $91.65 on confirming volume.
- **Invalidation:** $85.28 (Below last swing low)

### OZK (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Demand Reassertion

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence confirmed SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (2026-01-19, CLV -0.91). The last weekly bar is a wide spread up bar, closing high (CLV 0.65) on low volume (RelVol 0.62). This strong close confirms demand reassertion after the shakeout/test. The low volume on the up bar, following high volume weakness, indicates that supply is exhausted (No Supply/Effort Up). This supports the continuation of the quarterly bullish trend.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 50.66 (Last High), Immediate Support: 47.90, Support: 46.99 (Last Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $50.66 on confirming volume.
- **Invalidation:** $46.99 (Below last swing low)
