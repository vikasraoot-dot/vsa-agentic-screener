## 🚀 Ready for Entry
### AFRM (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Confirmation of Weakness

**Smart Money Logic:**
The BEARISH Quarterly Context is confirmed by the Weekly SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The last two weeks showed severe selling. The week of 2026-01-26 featured a wide spread down on high volume (RelVol 1.08) closing near the low (CLV -0.89), confirming strong supply entry. The most recent week (2026-02-02) saw even higher volume (RelVol 1.93) with a wide spread down, closing poorly (CLV -0.63). This is strong confirmation of supply absorption and mark-down phase acceleration. There is no visible Stopping Volume yet.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 64.62 (Recent High/Supply Shelf), Support: 55.33 (Recent Low), Resistance: 70.00 (Prior Support turned resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Sustained break below $55.33, or failed retest of $60.00.
- **Invalidation:** Sustained close above $70.00

### AIG (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Short-Term Reversal Attempt)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH, confirmed by a CONFIRMED_EARLY Weekly Supply Dominance. The initial two weeks of January saw massive volume and wide spreads down (CLV -0.92, -0.58), confirming heavy supply. The last two weeks, however, have seen significant bullish reversal signs. 2026-01-26 saw average volume (RelVol 0.73) and a strong close (CLV 0.96), suggesting No Supply. The most recent bar (2026-02-02) followed through with higher volume (RelVol 0.88) and a wide spread up, closing high (CLV 0.60). This suggests a strong Accumulation/Mark-Up phase initiation, contradicting the bearish trend and supply dominance signals, indicating a possible change of character (CHoCH).

**Key Levels:** Support: 72.11 (Recent Low/Tested Demand), Resistance: 77.52 (Recent High), Resistance: 83.56 (Prior Distribution Zone)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A close above $77.52 or a shallow retrace/test of $74.80 followed by a move higher.
- **Invalidation:** Close below $72.11

### ALKT (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Downside Continuation

**Smart Money Logic:**
Both the Quarterly trend and Weekly sequence point to BEARISH SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The price has been steadily declining. The last week (2026-02-02) saw a major move down (spread 5.20) on high volume (RelVol 1.93), closing poorly (CLV -0.53). This confirms strong selling pressure and acceleration of the markdown phase. Previous accumulation attempts have failed. The current action suggests supply is active and strong, pushing prices toward new lows.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 21.43 (Immediate Supply), Support: 16.23 (Recent Low), Resistance: 23.50 (Prior Supply Zone)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $16.23.
- **Invalidation:** Close above $21.43
---
### AMZN (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Mark Down Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH, and the Weekly sequence is flagged as SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. After a period of high-volume consolidation near the highs ($236-$248 range), the last bar (2026-02-02) delivered a clear sign of markdown acceleration. Volume was massive (RelVol 1.88), the spread was huge (46.04), and the close was poor (CLV -0.56). This is a strong Effort to Fall bar, indicating that heavy supply has overwhelmed demand and is initiating a new down leg, breaking key support at $236.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 236.74 (Broken Support / Immediate Resistance), Support: 200.31 (Recent Low), Resistance: 248.94 (Supply High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Failed retest of the broken support zone ($236.74) or a clear break below $200.31.
- **Invalidation:** Close above $239.30 (If it re-enters the prior consolidation range)
---
### AMZU (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Mark Down Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
Similar to AMZN, the trend is BEARISH. The last week (2026-02-02) showed extreme volatility with a massive spread (13.67) and exceptionally high volume (RelVol 2.57). The close was poor (CLV -0.58), significantly below the open and near the middle of the bar. This high volume, wide spread, poor close is a strong Effort to Fall, confirming the Supply Dominance identified by the algo. Smart Money is aggressively selling or liquidating positions, driving the price lower and breaking the consolidation pattern established in January.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 36.24 (Immediate Resistance/Broken Support), Support: 25.48 (Recent Low), Resistance: 40.05 (Supply High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Failed retest of $36.24 resistance or sustained move below $25.48.
- **Invalidation:** Close above $37.28
---
### APH (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Mark Down Acceleration

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the weekly sequence flags SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The last two weeks show intense selling pressure. The week of 2026-01-26 saw huge volume (RelVol 2.28) and a wide spread down (27.03), closing poorly (CLV -0.69). This is a significant Sign of Weakness (SOW). The most recent bar (2026-02-02) had high volume (RelVol 1.68) and a massive spread (23.03), closing low (CLV -0.12). This confirms that supply has entered the market aggressively, likely initiating a secondary markdown phase despite the underlying bullish quarterly context. The breakdown below $140 is concerning.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 149.24 (Immediate Supply), Support: 126.21 (Recent Low), Resistance: 167.04 (Supply Climax High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $126.21.
- **Invalidation:** Close above $149.24
---
### ARE (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Accumulation Confirmation)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH, and the Monthly flags CONFIRMED_EARLY Stopping Volume. The price recently broke the uptrend with a Sign of Weakness (SOW) on 2026-01-26 (CLV -0.54) on high volume (RelVol 1.53). This SOW found support near $53.14. The last bar (2026-02-02) showed average volume (RelVol 0.85) and a wide spread up, closing high (CLV 0.63). This confirms institutional demand reasserting control after the shakeout, driving the price back toward the prior high, confirming accumulation dynamics.

**Key Levels:** Support: 53.14 (Shakeout Low/Demand), Resistance: 59.76 (Supply High), Support: 54.64 (Immediate Demand)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close above $59.76 (Jumping the creek) or a low-volume test of $54.50 (No Supply).
- **Invalidation:** Close below $53.14
---
### ARES (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Mark Down Acceleration

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH, and the Weekly sequence confirms SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. Both the weekly and monthly charts show aggressive selling. The week of 2026-01-19 was a strong Sign of Weakness (SOW) with a wide spread down closing at the low (CLV -0.97). The last bar (2026-02-02) saw extremely high volume (RelVol 2.64) and a massive spread (31.23). Although the close was slightly off the low (CLV -0.29), this is still an Effort to Fall bar, confirming that supply is overwhelming any latent demand, leading to an acceleration of the markdown phase. The prior SOW is confirmed.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 149.67 (Immediate Supply), Support: 119.40 (Recent Low), Resistance: 177.72 (Distribution High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $119.40, or failure on a retest of $136.58.
- **Invalidation:** Close above $149.67
---
### ARWR (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Downside Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH, and the Weekly flags SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. After a weak attempt at recovery (2026-01-19/26), the price fell sharply in the final week (2026-02-02) on very high volume (RelVol 2.64). The spread was wide (12.65), and the close was poor (CLV -0.83). This is a strong signal of renewed supply pressure and a confirmed Effort to Fall, initiating another leg down. The bullish moves in the middle of January appear to be merely retracements within a broader markdown.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 76.11 (Supply High), Support: 63.46 (Recent Low/Demand Zone), Resistance: 68.51 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $63.46.
- **Invalidation:** Close above $68.51
---
### AVAV (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Confirmed Distribution

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the Monthly flags WATCH_FOR_TEST Buying Climax, suggesting a reversal. The weekly chart confirms this: the aggressive rally ended with massive volume and wide spreads in early January. The 2026-01-19 bar was a Sign of Weakness (SOW) with a huge spread down and poor close (CLV -0.82) on high volume (RelVol 1.44). This was followed by more high volume selling. The last bar (2026-02-02) saw high volume (RelVol 1.26) and a wide spread down, closing poorly (CLV -0.13), confirming the markdown phase. The bullish quarterly context is highly challenged by this pronounced weakness.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 321.04 (Immediate Supply), Support: 234.00 (Recent Low), Resistance: 408.25 (Distribution High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $234.00.
- **Invalidation:** Close above $321.04
---
### AXON (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Mark Down Acceleration

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH, and the Weekly flags SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. After a strong rally in early January that failed to hold above $636, the price entered a severe markdown phase. The 2026-01-26 bar was a Sign of Weakness (SOW) with massive spread and close near the low (CLV -0.96) on high volume (RelVol 1.31). The final bar (2026-02-02) saw extremely high volume (RelVol 2.03) and an even wider spread down, closing poorly (CLV -0.62). This confirms aggressive distribution and markdown acceleration, targeting lower price levels.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 483.58 (Immediate Resistance/Broken Support), Support: 396.41 (Recent Low), Resistance: 649.89 (Distribution High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Failed retest of $483.58 or a break below $396.41.
- **Invalidation:** Sustained close above $570.00 (Prior demand zone)
---
### AXTA (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Accumulation Confirmation)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH, and the Monthly flags CONFIRMED_EARLY Stopping Volume. Price action over the last two weeks has been positive. The 2026-01-26 bar showed high volume (RelVol 0.65) and a narrow spread, closing low (CLV -0.57), suggesting a minor shakeout. The last bar (2026-02-02) saw average volume (RelVol 0.99) and a wide spread up, closing strongly near the high (CLV 0.52). This price action indicates demand reassertion, confirming the accumulation narrative suggested by the monthly Stopping Volume signal. The low established at $31.45 appears to be defended by Smart Money.

**Key Levels:** Support: 31.45 (Demand Zone/Shakeout Low), Resistance: 34.50 (Swing High), Support: 33.33 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close above $34.55 on confirming volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close below $31.45
---
### AXTI (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Demand Reassertion (Spring Action)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH, though recent activity flagged Supply Dominance and a Buying Climax Watch. The price saw aggressive selling (CLV -0.86) on 2026-01-19, followed by high volume (RelVol 1.49) consolidation. The final bar (2026-02-02) was extremely bullish: high volume (RelVol 1.61), wide spread up, closing almost at the absolute high (CLV 0.97). This action strongly overcomes the prior supply (CLV -0.86 bar) and appears to be a Spring or Shakeout event followed by strong Mark-Up initiation. This reversal suggests Smart Money has completed accumulation and is now initiating a sustained move higher.

**Key Levels:** Support: 16.50 (Spring/Accumulation Low), Resistance: 26.66 (Prior High), Support: 22.69 (Immediate Demand)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Sustained close above $24.15 or a low volume pullback to test $20.00 (No Supply).
- **Invalidation:** Close below $17.01
---
### BAH (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Strong Rebound

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the Monthly flags CONFIRMED_EARLY Buying Climax. The strong move up culminated in a high-volume Sign of Weakness (SOW) on 2026-01-26 (RelVol 1.72, CLV -0.84), confirming distribution occurred near $103. This SOW was immediately met by a strong bullish reaction. The final bar (2026-02-02) saw average volume (RelVol 0.93) but a huge spread up, closing near the high (CLV 0.89). This strong rebound suggests the selling pressure was quickly absorbed (Stopping Volume reaction) and demand is back in control, confirming the low at $81.15 as potential accumulation support.

**Key Levels:** Support: 81.15 (Demand Zone/Shakeout Low), Resistance: 103.00 (Distribution High), Support: 87.20 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Sustained close above $98.19 (Clearing the prior swing high) or a shallow low-volume retest of $88.00.
- **Invalidation:** Close below $81.15
---
### BBT (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Demand Confirmation (Mark-Up Initiation)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the Monthly flags WATCH_FOR_TEST Buying Climax. However, the latest weekly action is strongly bullish. The price consolidated in January. The final bar (2026-02-02) saw high volume (RelVol 1.24) and a very wide spread up, closing almost at the high (CLV 0.87). This is a strong Effort to Rise bar, confirming demand reassertion and initiating a mark-up phase, potentially targeting the prior high of the monthly climax or even surpassing it. The volume confirms commitment from Smart Money.

**Key Levels:** Support: 28.18 (Immediate Demand/Base), Resistance: 31.80 (Swing High/Supply), Support: 27.71 (Prior Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry on a slight pullback to $30.00 or sustained break above $31.80.
- **Invalidation:** Close below $28.18
---
### BBWI (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Demand Confirmation (Mark-Up Continuation)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the Monthly flags CONFIRMED_EARLY Supply Dominance (based on the prior month's poor close on high volume). However, the weekly action shows renewed strength. The last two bars show demand reasserting itself. The 2026-01-26 bar saw high volume (RelVol 0.67) and a strong close (CLV 0.61). The final bar (2026-02-02) saw average volume (RelVol 0.60) and a wide spread up, closing high (CLV 0.64). This is a continuation signal, suggesting the supply observed previously has been absorbed, and the price is resuming its mark-up phase.

**Key Levels:** Support: 21.54 (Demand Zone), Resistance: 23.73 (Swing High), Support: 22.02 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Sustained close above $23.73.
- **Invalidation:** Close below $21.54
---
### BCE (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Strong Reversal

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the Weekly flags SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. Price had been steadily climbing (CLV 0.97, 0.93). The last bar (2026-02-02) shows a severe reversal, featuring extremely high volume (RelVol 1.84), a wide spread down, and a close near the absolute low (CLV -0.85). This is a textbook Sign of Weakness (SOW) or Effort No Result/Selling Climax, confirming institutional selling and overwhelming supply, especially given the preceding strong rallies. This likely initiates a markdown phase or a significant correction within the bullish quarterly trend.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 25.86 (Broken Support/Immediate Supply), Support: 24.97 (Recent Low), Resistance: 26.49 (Supply High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $24.97, or a failed retest of $25.86.
- **Invalidation:** Close above $26.49
---
### BEP (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Demand Confirmation (Mark-Up Continuation)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the Monthly flags CONFIRMED_EARLY Supply Dominance. Recent weekly action contradicts the monthly weakness. The last two weeks saw high volume and strong closes. The final bar (2026-02-02) had average volume (RelVol 0.78) and a wide spread up, closing high (CLV 0.64). This is a strong continuation bar, indicating that the supply from earlier in January has been absorbed, and demand is currently in control, driving prices higher. The structure suggests a potential resumption of the mark-up phase.

**Key Levels:** Support: 29.33 (Immediate Demand), Resistance: 30.72 (Swing High), Support: 28.21 (Prior Demand Zone)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Sustained close above $30.72 on confirming volume.

---
### BFH (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Demand Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH, and the Weekly flags WATCH_FOR_TEST Stopping Volume. The price experienced a sharp shakeout in January (CLV -0.91 on 2026-01-19, followed by an aggressive test on 2026-01-26). The final bar (2026-02-02) saw average volume (RelVol 1.32) and a very wide spread up (8.12), closing near the absolute high (CLV 0.90). This is a powerful Effort to Rise bar, confirming that the earlier selling pressure was successfully absorbed and demand has reasserted full control, likely initiating a mark-up phase.

#### Action Plan

---
### BKSY (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Demand Reassertion (Spring Action)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the Monthly flags CONFIRMED_EARLY Buying Climax. The price experienced strong selling pressure on 2026-01-26 (CLV -0.91) on high volume (RelVol 0.89), followed by a swift rebound. The final bar (2026-02-02) saw high volume (RelVol 1.11) and a wide spread up, closing in the middle/high (CLV 0.54). This movement, rebounding strongly from the low of $19.32, suggests a Spring or Shakeout event, indicating that supply was successfully absorbed and accumulation completed, setting up a bullish run.

**Key Levels:** Support: 19.32 (Spring Low/Demand Zone), Resistance: 28.30 (Immediate Supply), Resistance: 29.79 (Climax High)

#### Action Plan

---
### BNS (NEUTRAL to BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Demand Reassertion

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the Weekly flags SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. After a period of consolidation (CLV swinging between -0.60 and 0.89), the price attempted to break higher. The 2026-01-26 bar showed high volume and a poor close (CLV -0.58), indicating supply intrusion. However, the final bar (2026-02-02) saw average volume (RelVol 1.10) and a wide spread up, closing almost at the high (CLV 0.93). This is a strong Effort to Rise bar, suggesting demand has cleared the recent supply and is initiating a mark-up phase. The $73.72 low appears to be strongly defended.

**Key Levels:** Support: 73.72 (Demand Zone), Resistance: 76.56 (Swing High), Resistance: 74.98 (Prior Supply Zone)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Sustained break and close above $76.56.

---
### BP (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Demand Confirmation (Mark-Up Continuation)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH, despite the CONFIRMED_EARLY Weekly Supply Dominance (which now appears to be accumulation/absorption). Price action is strongly bullish. The last four weeks show increasing conviction and rising closes. The final bar (2026-02-02) had high volume (RelVol 1.36) and a wide spread up, closing high (CLV 0.54). This is a strong continuation bar, suggesting that the initial selling pressure in early January (CLV -0.37) was absorbed and Smart Money is continuing the mark-up phase, clearing previous resistance.

**Key Levels:** Support: 37.29 (Immediate Demand), Resistance: 39.51 (Swing High), Support: 36.46 (Prior Demand Zone)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Sustained close above $39.51.
- **Invalidation:** Close below $37.29
---
### CALM (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Upthrust/Supply Check

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar (2026-02-02) shows a wide spread up/down on High Volume (RelVol 1.02), closing near the low (CLV -0.933). This is a potential Upthrust or significant supply dumping at the top of the rally, reversing the gains from the high (89.48) dramatically. Despite the Quarterly Context being BULLISH, this severe rejection suggests supply dominance is taking hold, matching the 'SUPPLY_DOMINANCE' Algo Detection.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 89.48 (Upthrust High), Support: 82.29 (Weekly Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below the previous weekly low of 82.29 on strength.
- **Invalidation:** 89.48
---
### CALX (BULLISH)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar (2026-02-02) features a wide spread up bar on Ultra-High Volume (RelVol 2.18), closing very high (CLV 0.827). This powerful move immediately follows the prior week's wide-spread down bar on Ultra-High Volume (2026-01-26, RelVol 2.84), which was a Selling Climax. The current bar confirms strong institutional buying (absorption) after the sell-off, overriding the prior bearish action.

**Key Levels:** Support: 44.70 (Absorption/Climax Low), Resistance: 55.00 (Previous Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry above 53.98 (Weekly High) or a low-volume test near 45.15.
- **Invalidation:** 44.70
---
### CBRL (BULLISH)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar (2026-02-02) shows a wide spread up on high volume (RelVol 0.89), closing very high (CLV 0.737). This indicates strong demand stepping in, overriding the weakness shown in the previous two weeks, and confirming the BULLISH Quarterly Context. The prior monthly bar confirmed SUPPLY_DOMINANCE, suggesting current demand is overcoming that weakness.

**Key Levels:** Support: 29.70 (Weekly Low), Resistance: 34.43 (Weekly High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 34.43 on continuing high volume.
- **Invalidation:** 29.70

This massive volume coupled with a strong close confirms absorption by smart money, marking a Change of Behavior (CoB) and potentially ending the distribution phase initiated by the Monthly BUYING_CLIMAX.

**Key Levels:** Support: 19.07 (Absorption Low), Resistance: 22.60 (Previous consolidation high)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 22.12 (Weekly High) on strength.

**VSA Status:** Demand Confirmed (Sign of Strength)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry on a shallow, low-volume pullback (Test) to the breakout level around $185.00 - $190.00.

---
### KYMR (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax/Sign of Strength

**Smart Money Logic:**
KYMR confirmed an Early Buying Climax on the monthly chart, but the latest weekly bar suggests potential bullish continuation or a re-test of highs. High volume (RelVol 0.969) on a wide spread closing near the high (CLV 0.907) is a strong Sign of Strength (SOS). Since the quarterly trend is Bullish, this SOS is generally positive, suggesting the stock might be entering a final phase of mark-up, pushing past previous resistance levels. The previous weekly bar showed accumulation near the middle/high (CLV 0.469).

**Key Levels:** $80.00 (New High/Immediate Resistance), $71.18 (Support Base), $77.92 (Prior High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A low-volume Test (No Supply) back towards the $75.00 - $77.00 breakout level.

The last two weekly bars show escalating volume (RelVol 1.781 and 2.053) on wide spreads, both closing near the high (CLV 0.781 and 0.742). This confirms massive aggressive demand and a successful breakout into new territory. Smart Money is actively marking price up.

Volume (RelVol 1.421) is high on a wide spread, closing strongly near the high (CLV 0.563). This is a strong positive sign (SOS), suggesting the absorption from the previous week's low-volume Test ($106.00) was successful. Smart Money is now marking the price up aggressively, challenging the bearish quarterly context.

**Key Levels:** $104.73 (Support/Base Low), $113.85 (Recent High/Resistance), $106.00 (Prior Support)

#### Action Plan

### ONB (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Sign of Strength (SOS)

This is a strong Sign of Strength (SOS) that overrides the prior monthly warning, particularly within a Bullish Quarterly Trend. The previous three bars showed consistent positive closes, indicating accumulation and continuation of the mark-up phase.

**Key Levels:** $26.16 (New High), $24.28 (Support Base), $24.78 (Prior Resistance)

#### Action Plan

---
### OTIS (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Sign of Strength / Test of Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
OTIS is in a Bullish Quarterly Trend. The latest weekly bar shows high volume (RelVol 1.689) on a wide spread, closing strongly near the high (CLV 0.350, suggesting a reversal off the low). This bar successfully tested the supply introduced by the previous week's Supply Dominance bar (RelVol 2.101, CLV -0.629). The bounce from the low on high volume suggests Smart Money absorbed the selling and marked the price back up. This is a successful Test of Supply/Spring action.

**Key Levels:** $85.28 (Spring/Test Low), $91.65 (Prior High/Resistance), $92.05 (Recent High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry upon a break and close above $90.50, targeting the prior high.
- **Invalidation:** $85.28 (Break below the low of the spring bar)

**Smart Money Logic:**
OZK, despite a recent Supply Dominance warning, shows a strong bullish continuation. The latest weekly bar has average volume (RelVol 1.013) on a wide spread, closing almost at the high (CLV 0.986). This is an exceptionally strong close, indicating complete demand dominance and confirming the continuation of the Bullish Quarterly Trend. The recent supply event (Week 3, CLV -0.913) was successfully reversed and overcome, suggesting it was likely a shakeout.

**Key Levels:** $51.43 (New High), $46.99 (Support Base), $48.04 (Prior Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A low-volume Test (No Supply) back towards the $49.00 - $50.00 breakout zone.

---
### PB (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Sign of Strength

**Smart Money Logic:**
PB, within a Bullish Quarterly Trend, experienced a sharp shakeout last week (RelVol 2.380, close near low). The latest weekly bar shows high volume (RelVol 1.786) on a wide spread, closing near the high (CLV 0.916). This strong bullish action, immediately following the heavy selling, confirms that Smart Money successfully absorbed the supply near $68.07. This bar acts both as Stopping Volume and a subsequent Sign of Strength (SOS), reversing the prior weakness.

**Key Levels:** $74.79 (New High), $68.07 (Spring/Support Low), $72.00 (Prior Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry upon a break and close above $74.80, or a shallow, low-volume Test of $72.00.

### PSN (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Test of Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
PSN is showing resilience within a Bullish Quarterly Trend. The latest bar has average volume (RelVol 0.739) and a narrow spread, closing near the high (CLV 0.618). This action follows a previous Supply Dominance bar (Week 4, RelVol 0.863, CLV -0.570), suggesting Smart Money is successfully testing the supply that emerged during the recent pullback. The high close and moderate volume indicate demand is reasserting control.

**Key Levels:** $67.11 (Immediate Support), $70.06 (Prior Close/Resistance), $73.26 (Recent High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry upon a break and close above $70.00.

This is a follow-through move from the strong close the previous week (CLV 0.760), confirming demand dominance.

**Key Levels:** $31.17 (New High), $28.36 (Support Base), $28.67 (Prior Resistance)

---
### RLI (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Sign of Strength (SOS)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Despite the Monthly Supply Dominance alert, the weekly chart shows strong short-term bullish action. The latest bar has average volume (RelVol 0.933) and a moderate spread, closing in the upper half (CLV 0.542). This SOS builds on the prior week's accumulation (CLV 0.196) and pushes the price strongly upward, suggesting the supply was successfully absorbed. This is a strong bullish reversal after the recent downtrend in January.

**Key Levels:** $62.78 (Recent High), $58.15 (Support Base), $59.45 (Prior Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A low-volume Test (No Supply) back towards the $59.50 - $60.50 level.
- **Invalidation:** $58.15 (Below the low of the SOS bar)
---
### SATS (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax/Supply Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly sequence confirms a Buying Climax. The recent weekly bars show volatility indicative of a distribution phase. The 1/26 bar had an extremely wide spread (22.37) on high volume (1.78 RelVol) and closed near the low (CLV -0.67), signaling heavy institutional selling (Supply Dominance). The latest week (2/2) had another wide spread down bar on high volume (1.17 RelVol), confirming supply pressure, despite the close being off the absolute low (CLV -0.38). Smart Money is unloading shares.

**Key Levels:** 123.00 (Immediate Resistance), 106.60 (Swing Low Support), 132.25 (Previous High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Failure to hold 110.00 or break below 106.60 on increased volume.
- **Invalidation:** 125.00 (Above prior week's high 122.99)
---
### TFX (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply/High Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
TFX has been heavily supplied (bearish quarterly context). However, the last weekly bar (2/2) stands out. It's a very wide spread up bar (7.29 points) closing extremely high (CLV 0.85) on significantly high relative volume (1.54). This high effort for high result indicates strong demand overcoming previous supply. The close at 108.42 is a significant recovery, potentially marking a secondary Selling Climax/Major Reversal.

**Key Levels:** 101.65 (Recent Low/Support), 110.00 (Immediate Target), 112.90 (High Supply Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry on strength above 109.00, or if price dips back to 104.00 for a low volume test.
- **Invalidation:** 101.00 (Below recent low)
---
### TXT (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Demand Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
Despite the prior week's Supply Dominance (1/26: High volume, wide spread down, CLV -0.34), the most recent week (2/2) shows powerful demand entry. It was a wide spread up bar closing near the high (CLV 0.90) on high relative volume (1.58). This VSA signature is 'Effort for Result' and indicates Smart Money absorbing the previous supply and driving the price back up toward the recent highs, contradicting the bearish quarterly context for the short term.

**Key Levels:** 86.36 (Recent Low/Support), 95.87 (Immediate Resistance/High), 97.00 (Overhead Supply)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 96.00 signaling continuation of demand absorption.
- **Invalidation:** 87.00 (Below recent low)
---
### UGI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence indicates a Buying Climax. The week of 1/26 saw high volume (2.19 RelVol) on a wide bar, but closed near the midpoint/low (CLV -0.02), indicating selling absorption or supply entry. The latest week (2/2) confirmed supply: a wide spread down bar on high volume (1.16 RelVol), closing on the absolute low (CLV -1.0). This strong effort for negative result confirms Smart Money distribution is underway, signaling a reversal from the quarterly bullish trend.

**Key Levels:** 37.09 (Current Low/Support), 38.95 (Breakdown Point/Resistance), 41.34 (Climax High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 37.00 on volume, or a bounce that fails to recapture 39.00.
- **Invalidation:** 40.20 (Above recent congestion)
---
### USIG (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply (High Close)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Despite the 'Supply Dominance' detection, this is ETF behavior (usually tighter ranges). The last weekly bar (2/2) showed high volume (1.26 RelVol) but closed extremely high (CLV 0.96) on a narrow spread, maintaining the upward momentum within the bullish quarterly trend. The recent high volume bars are not resulting in deep sell-offs, suggesting demand is actively absorbing any pressure (Absorption/No Supply in context of the monthly CLV 0.31). The high close confirms strength.

**Key Levels:** 51.63 (Recent Low Support), 51.92 (New High/Resistance), 52.00 (Psychological Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 51.93 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** 51.50 (Below recent accumulation zone)
---
### WHR (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Confirmed)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is bullish. The stock experienced a major shakeout/Stopping Volume in the week of 1/26 (2.14 RelVol, wide spread, CLV 0.11), suggesting heavy selling was absorbed near 72.55. The latest week (2/2) provided a clear follow-through: high volume (1.29 RelVol) on a wide up bar, closing firmly near the high (CLV 0.58). This VSA pattern confirms aggressive buying absorption and a recovery attempt by Smart Money, confirming the Stopping Volume effectiveness.

**Key Levels:** 77.60 (Immediate Support), 85.80 (Recent Congestion), 88.85 (High/Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 88.85 on increasing volume for continuation of the quarterly bullish trend.
- **Invalidation:** 76.00 (Below accumulation zone)
---
### WRB (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply/Demand Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
Despite the monthly Supply Dominance context, the weekly action is consolidating high. The last bar (2/2) saw decreased volume (0.69 RelVol) on a narrow to medium spread up bar, closing near the high (CLV 0.35). The decreased volume confirms 'No Supply' following the high volume/wide spread down bars in early January. This lack of selling pressure, combined with the stock holding consolidation levels near 68.00, suggests accumulation is occurring under the radar, preparing for a potential breakout within the bullish quarterly trend.

**Key Levels:** 67.25 (Support/No Supply Zone), 71.08 (Immediate Resistance), 71.90 (Recent High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 71.90 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** 67.00 (Below recent support)
---
## 👀 Watch/Monitoring
### ABT (NEUTRAL to BULLISH (Short-Term Rebound))
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Attempted)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last two weekly candles show high volume (RelVol > 2.0 and > 1.5) but narrowing spreads and closes near the middle/high (CLV -0.80 -> 0.57 -> 0.90). The massive volume in the 2026-01-19 weekly bar (RelVol 2.57) coupled with a wide spread down and a close near the low (-0.80 CLV) confirms significant supply. However, the subsequent two weeks show recovery attempts. The most recent week (2026-02-02) has high volume and a narrow spread closing near the high (CLV 0.90), suggesting Stopping Volume absorbing supply around $106-$111 after the major drop. The Quarterly Context is BEARISH, so this is likely a short-term rebound/reaction.

**Key Levels:** Support: 105.78 (Recent Low/Stopping Volume Area), Resistance: 121.88 (Prior Low Spread/Supply line), Resistance: 125.76 (Breakdown Point)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Sustained close above $111 on decreasing volume (Test for No Supply).
- **Invalidation:** Close below $105.78
---
### ABVX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Effort No Result (Downside Reaction)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence is marked by a confirmed strong Buying Climax. The recent action shows extreme volatility and poor closes. The 2026-01-05 bar had a huge spread down and a poor close (CLV -0.54), followed by another wide spread down the next week (CLV -0.55). Although the most recent week (2026-02-02) closed high (CLV 0.91), the volume (RelVol 0.52) is significantly low compared to the volatility peaks, indicating that the supply absorbed previously is not yet tested, or the bounce is weak (low effort). Monthly context confirms SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. This is still highly volatile and prone to downside continuation given the large prior selling.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 130.13 (Initial Climax High), Support: 107.42 (Recent Low/Demand Zone), Resistance: 118.11 (Recent bounce high)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $107.42 or failure to sustain above $118.11 on low volume.
- **Invalidation:** Sustained close above $130.13
---
### ACLX (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result (Supply/Demand Battle)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the Monthly sequence shows WATCH_FOR_TEST Supply Dominance. The last three weeks show wide volatility (large spreads) but decreasing conviction (CLV swinging wildly). The 2026-01-19 bar was a wide spread up on high volume (RelVol 1.51) but closed near the low (CLV -0.67), a clear sign of Effort No Result / Supply overwhelming demand near $76. The latest bar (2026-02-02) closed mid-to-low (CLV -0.33) on average volume, suggesting indecision and continued absorption or accumulation in the $66-$71 range. A test of the $66 support is anticipated.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 76.50 (Supply High), Support: 66.00 (Recent Key Support), Resistance: 70.11 (Prior high area)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Bounce and close above $69.00 on increasing volume, or break below $66.00.
- **Invalidation:** Break above $76.50 (Bullish confirmation) or sustained close below $66.00 (Bearish confirmation).
---
### ACWX (NEUTRAL to BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Potential Reversal in Progress)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the weekly sequence flags a WATCH_FOR_TEST Buying Climax. The last four weeks show persistent high volume (RelVol > 1.9), with narrow spreads for the first three, and then a slightly wider spread on the last bar. The 2026-01-26 bar showed high volume, wide spread, but a poor close (CLV -0.68), indicating supply intrusion at the high ($72.33). The most recent bar (2026-02-02) bounced and closed strong (CLV 0.97) on lower but still elevated volume (RelVol 1.44). This strong bounce needs to be tested for confirmation of demand strength. If the previous high cannot be cleared, supply remains dominant.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 72.33 (Climax High/Supply), Support: 70.30 (Immediate Support), Support: 68.30 (Previous swing low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Sustained break and close above $72.33 (Bullish continuation) or failure near $72.33 followed by a break below $70.30 (Bearish reversal).
- **Invalidation:** Close above $72.33 (Bullish confirmation) or breakdown below $69.00.
---
### AEVA (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Downside Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly and Monthly contexts are BEARISH, confirmed by the Weekly sequence (WATCH_FOR_TEST Supply Dominance). The trend is clearly down. The week of 2026-01-19 saw high volume and a wide spread down closing at the low (CLV -0.98), confirming massive selling pressure (Selling Climax/Effort to Fall). The subsequent week continued the move down with high volume and a low close (CLV -0.83). The final bar (2026-02-02) saw slightly lower volume (RelVol 0.84) but closed neutral (CLV 0.02) after a wide spread down, suggesting a possible temporary halt, but the overwhelming supply has pushed the price significantly lower. The overall trend remains extremely weak.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 15.81 (Immediate Supply/Prior Low), Support: 11.18 (Recent Low), Resistance: 19.87 (Prior Breakdown Zone)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $11.18 or failure/weak test near $13.56.
- **Invalidation:** Sustained close above $15.81

### AGIO (NEUTRAL to BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort to Fall / Monthly Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH, but the Monthly sequence flags CONFIRMED_EARLY Stopping Volume. Weekly action is mixed. The final two weeks show high volume selling pressure: 2026-01-26 had a wide spread down closing low (CLV -0.67), and 2026-02-02 had average volume and a wide spread down closing near the absolute low (CLV -0.92). The selling pressure is confirming the bearish quarterly trend. However, the monthly perspective identifies this area as potential accumulation/stopping volume after a large drop (Dec CLV 0.04, Jan CLV -0.35, Feb CLV -0.92, on decreasing volume), meaning the market is reaching a crucial decision point. Bears currently have the short-term edge.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 28.70 (Immediate Supply), Support: 26.25 (Key Short-term Support), Resistance: 29.93 (Swing High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and hold below $26.25, or a low volume test of $26.45 followed by a strong bullish bar.
- **Invalidation:** Close above $29.93
---
### AHR (NEUTRAL to BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Effort No Result (Potential Distribution)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the Weekly flags a WATCH_FOR_TEST Buying Climax. The 2026-01-26 week saw extremely high volume (RelVol 3.99) but the close was neutral (CLV 0.15), indicating massive supply absorption during a wide spread move. This high volume, mid-close bar often marks a Selling Climax or a major sign of weakness (SOW). The final week (2026-02-02) saw high volume (RelVol 1.39) and a wide spread up, closing high (CLV 0.56). This last bar is a recovery effort, potentially confirming a successful test of demand after the prior week's shakeout, or a final push into resistance before distribution takes hold. Given the previous climax signal and high volume SOW, caution is warranted.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 49.52 (High of Climax/Supply), Support: 45.37 (Shakeout Low), Support: 46.07 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Failure to hold above $49.00 or a break below $46.07.
- **Invalidation:** Sustained close above $49.52 (Bullish continuation)
---
### AIQ (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Effort No Result (Downside Confirmation)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH. Monthly flags WATCH_FOR_TEST Buying Climax. The recent price action shows signs of distribution. The 2026-01-26 bar had high volume (RelVol 0.72) and a wide spread down, closing near the low (CLV -0.80), indicating supply entry. The latest bar (2026-02-02) was extremely volatile (wide spread 4.44) on high volume (RelVol 1.05) and closed in the middle/low (CLV -0.19). This wide spread, poor close on high volume is a textbook Effort No Result, suggesting supply is active and keeping the price from recovering. The recent low ($48.27) is a critical test area.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 53.94 (Supply High), Support: 48.28 (Recent Low/Potential Stopping Volume), Resistance: 51.97 (Prior Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $48.28.
- **Invalidation:** Close above $52.72
---
### ALC (NEUTRAL to BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Accumulation Confirmation)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly context is BULLISH. The Monthly flags CONFIRMED_EARLY Stopping Volume, suggesting accumulation at lower levels. The last three weeks have seen prices consolidate in the $77-$82 range. The most recent bar (2026-02-02) saw significantly high volume (RelVol 1.31) with a wide spread down, but the close was near the middle/high (CLV 0.17). This bar could be interpreted as Stopping Volume absorbing sellers, successfully holding the $76.95 low. This action supports the monthly accumulation narrative and suggests institutional interest defending the support zone.

**Key Levels:** Support: 76.95 (Stopping Volume Low), Resistance: 80.98 (Immediate Resistance), Resistance: 82.50 (Swing High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close above $80.15 on high volume, confirming demand continuation.
- **Invalidation:** Sustained close below $76.95
---
### ALL (NEUTRAL to BULLISH (Short-Term))
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Stopping Volume (Reaction Phase)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the weekly sequence shows CONFIRMED_EARLY Supply Dominance due to the massive selling on 2026-01-12 (RelVol 2.04, CLV -0.94). This was a clear sign of weakness (SOW). However, the price held the low around $191 and consolidated. The most recent bar (2026-02-02) saw high volume (RelVol 1.44) and a very wide spread, but closed near the high (CLV 0.007, essentially middle of the high-low range, but closing much higher than the open). This highly volatile bar is indicative of Stopping Volume or a professional effort to drive the price higher, absorbing supply from the $198-$216 range. This suggests accumulation/reaction after the SOW.

**Key Levels:** Support: 191.13 (Spring/Stopping Volume Low), Resistance: 216.75 (Recent High/Supply Line), Support: 198.22 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Sustained close above $208 (Clearing the high of the stopping volume bar close) or a low volume test back to $198.
- **Invalidation:** Close below $191.13
---
### AMBA (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Demand Reassertion

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH, and the Weekly is flagged as SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The selling pressure was intense in early January (2026-01-05 CLV -0.88). Subsequent action saw consolidation. The last bar (2026-02-02) showed a wide spread (6.98) on high volume (RelVol 0.99) but managed to close well off the lows (CLV 0.44). This is a potential reaction bar or Stopping Volume absorbing selling below $60. The price action suggests a potential temporary change of character (CHoCH) against the bearish trend, likely leading to a relief rally.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 65.57 (Immediate Supply), Support: 58.58 (Stopping Volume Low), Resistance: 70.77 (Prior Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Sustained close above $65.57, or a low volume test back toward $60.00 (No Supply).
- **Invalidation:** Close below $58.58
---
### AMKR (NEUTRAL to BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Potential Reversal)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the Monthly flags WATCH_FOR_TEST Buying Climax, suggesting potential distribution. The weekly trend shows significant volatility and price swings. The last two weeks saw high volume (RelVol 0.87, 1.30). The 2026-01-26 bar was a wide spread down, closing near the low (CLV -0.77), indicating supply. The most recent bar (2026-02-02) was extremely volatile (spread 7.85) on high volume (RelVol 1.30) but closed strongly near the high (CLV 0.83). This looks like a shakeout (Spring action or a Test of Demand) absorbing the recent weakness, followed by strong demand reassertion. However, given the monthly climax warning, this move needs confirmation above prior supply levels.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 55.17 (Climax High), Support: 42.14 (Spring/Shakeout Low), Resistance: 48.33 (Prior Support/Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Sustained close above $49.99 on strong follow-through volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close below $46.77 (Failure of the reaction high)
---
### AMSC (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Downside Reaction

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH, and the Weekly flags WATCH_FOR_TEST Stopping Volume. The price had a sharp correction, bottoming out at $24.87 on the last bar (2026-02-02). This bar had extremely high volume (RelVol 1.93) and a wide spread, but the close was neutral/low (CLV -0.05). This suggests Stopping Volume, where Smart Money stepped in, but they did not achieve a strong close, meaning supply remains significant. The price is currently reacting negatively to the high volume bar, indicating weakness in the accumulation attempt. The low close in the monthly candle also reinforces the bearish outlook despite the stopping volume sign.

**Key Levels:** Support: 24.87 (Stopping Volume Low), Resistance: 31.85 (Immediate Supply), Resistance: 34.50 (Swing High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $24.87.
- **Invalidation:** Sustained close above $31.85
---
### APLS (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Selling Climax Reaction

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH, but the Weekly flags WATCH_FOR_TEST Buying Climax (which often precede downside). The price saw aggressive selling (Sign of Weakness) on 2026-01-12 (CLV -0.94) on high volume (RelVol 1.54). This marked a potential selling climax. The subsequent action has been choppy, with the latest bar (2026-02-02) showing good relative volume (RelVol 0.91) and a wide spread up, closing high (CLV 0.51). This suggests demand is reasserting itself after the shakeout towards $19.76-$21.10. The setup implies a reaction rally or accumulation is underway, challenging the bearish quarterly context.

**Key Levels:** Support: 21.10 (Immediate Demand), Resistance: 24.10 (Immediate Supply), Support: 19.26 (Spring Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Sustained close above $24.10, or a low volume test back toward $21.50.
- **Invalidation:** Close below $21.10
---
### APO (NEUTRAL to BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Accumulation Confirmation)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH, but the Weekly flags WATCH_FOR_TEST Stopping Volume. The last bar (2026-02-02) saw very high volume (RelVol 1.84) and a massive spread (14.52), yet closed strongly at the mid-to-high point (CLV 0.51). This high volume, off-the-low close is a strong indication of Stopping Volume, where Smart Money absorbed supply near the $122 low. This action contradicts the BEARISH quarterly trend and suggests institutional accumulation is likely occurring at these lower levels.

**Key Levels:** Support: 122.06 (Stopping Volume Low), Resistance: 137.00 (Immediate Supply), Resistance: 145.89 (Prior Consolidation Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Sustained rally above $137.00, or a shallow retest of $128.88 on low volume (No Supply).
- **Invalidation:** Close below $122.06
---
### ARCC (NEUTRAL to BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Weak Reaction)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH, and the Weekly flags WATCH_FOR_TEST Stopping Volume. The 2026-01-26 bar saw high volume (RelVol 1.16) and a tight spread down, closing near the low (CLV -0.95), suggesting supply entry. The final bar (2026-02-02) saw extreme volume (RelVol 2.07) and a wide spread down, but the close was near the middle/low (CLV -0.02). This high volume/wide spread bar suggests Stopping Volume absorbing the massive selling near $18.76. However, the lack of a strong close indicates Smart Money didn't completely reverse the trend, leaving the area vulnerable to further testing or breakdown. The bearish context dictates caution.

**Key Levels:** Support: 18.76 (Stopping Volume Low), Resistance: 19.89 (Immediate Resistance), Resistance: 20.75 (Prior Range High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close above $19.89, confirming demand, or break below $18.76, confirming weakness.
- **Invalidation:** Close below $18.76
---
### AS (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Demand Reaction

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the Monthly confirms SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The week of 2026-01-26 showed strong supply intrusion (CLV -0.78). The final bar (2026-02-02) saw average volume (RelVol 1.08) and a wide spread, but managed to close strongly off the lows (CLV 0.58). This suggests the aggressive selling was met by demand, resulting in a Stopping Volume reaction. Price is now back near the midpoint of the recent range ($34.8-$38.2), indicating a balance between aggressive supply and responsive demand.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 38.21 (Immediate Supply), Support: 34.82 (Demand Zone/Spring Low), Resistance: 38.91 (Swing High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Sustained close above $38.21 (Confirming rally), or a low volume test back toward $35.00 (No Supply).
- **Invalidation:** Close below $34.82
---
### ASML (NEUTRAL to BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Effort No Result (Potential Distribution)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the Weekly flags WATCH_FOR_TEST Buying Climax. The strong uptrend saw massive volume (RelVol 1.96) on 2026-01-26, coupled with a huge spread, but the bar closed weakly at the middle (CLV -0.30). This is a textbook Effort No Result, indicating heavy supply intrusion (Selling Climax) at $1493. The latest bar (2026-02-02) saw high volume (RelVol 1.28) and a huge spread down, yet the close was slightly higher (CLV 0.41), suggesting demand absorption, but the previous week's supply remains a dominant factor. The volatility suggests a reversal is imminent.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 1493.48 (Climax High/Supply), Support: 1316.06 (Demand Zone/Stopping Volume Low), Resistance: 1453.16 (Immediate Supply)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Failure to hold above $1400 or break and close below $1385.16 (Sustained move below recent support).
- **Invalidation:** Sustained close above $1493.48 (Bullish continuation)
---
### ATO (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Potential Distribution)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH, and the Weekly flags WATCH_FOR_TEST Buying Climax. The price has been consolidating at high levels with high relative volume in the last four weeks (RelVol 1.25, 1.77, 2.27, 1.53). The 2026-01-26 bar showed extremely high volume and a tight range, closing low (CLV -0.22), which is potentially weakness. The final bar (2026-02-02) saw high volume and a wide spread up, closing high (CLV 0.36), confirming demand is still present, pushing to a new swing high ($174.57). This suggests a continuation, but the prior high volume/low close bar suggests supply is still active and needs to be cleared or tested.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 174.57 (Swing High/Supply), Support: 164.50 (Demand Zone), Resistance: 170.67 (Prior Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Sustained close above $174.57 (Bullish continuation) or reversal and close below $168.00 on high volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close below $164.50
---
### BABX (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Indecision

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH, and the Monthly flags WATCH_FOR_TEST Supply Dominance. Price action has been highly volatile. After a rally towards $53, selling pressure reasserted itself (2026-01-26, CLV -0.88). The last bar (2026-02-02) saw low volume (RelVol 0.70) and a wide spread, but the close was near the middle (CLV -0.12). This signifies indecision (churning), holding the recent low of $39.71. The low volume suggests Smart Money might be pausing, waiting for the overall market direction, or that the previous supply intrusion is cooling off.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 46.61 (Immediate Supply), Support: 39.71 (Recent Low/Demand Zone), Resistance: 53.35 (Supply High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close above $46.61, or break and close below $39.71.
- **Invalidation:** Close below $39.71
---
### BAM (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Accumulation Confirmation)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH, but the Weekly flags WATCH_FOR_TEST Stopping Volume. The price had a sharp drop (SOW on 2026-01-26, CLV -0.79). The final bar (2026-02-02) saw extremely high volume (RelVol 2.09) and a wide spread, closing in the middle/high (CLV 0.38). This is a strong Stopping Volume bar, successfully absorbing the supply around the $46.76 low. This heavy volume at the low suggests Smart Money is accumulating, setting the stage for a reversal/reaction rally, contradicting the BEARISH quarterly context in the short term.

**Key Levels:** Support: 46.76 (Stopping Volume Low), Resistance: 52.21 (Immediate Supply), Resistance: 54.52 (Prior High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Sustained close above $50.87 (Clearing the high of the Stopping Volume bar) or a low volume test of $48.22 (No Supply).
- **Invalidation:** Close below $46.76
---
### BANC (NEUTRAL to BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Potential Reversal)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the Monthly flags CONFIRMED_STRONG Buying Climax. Price has been choppy at the high end of the range. The 2026-01-19 bar was a high-volume reversal, closing near the low (CLV -0.96), a strong Sign of Weakness (SOW). The final bar (2026-02-02) saw extremely high volume (RelVol 1.97) and a wide spread up, closing very strong (CLV 0.88). This massive volume move, closing strong, appears to be a successful spring/shakeout, absorbing the previous supply and initiating a mark-up. However, given the long-term climax warning, this could be the final phase of the climb.

**Key Levels:** Support: 19.41 (Shakeout Low), Resistance: 21.61 (Climax High), Support: 19.67 (Immediate Demand)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Sustained close above $21.09 (Confirming strength) or rejection near $21.61 followed by a break below $19.98.
- **Invalidation:** Close below $19.41
---
### BBIO (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Absorption)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH, and the Weekly flags WATCH_FOR_TEST Stopping Volume. The final bar (2026-02-02) saw extremely high volume (RelVol 1.62) and a wide spread down (17.15), but closed poorly (CLV -0.39). While volume is high, suggesting institutional buying (Stopping Volume) near the low of $62.84, the poor close indicates that supply still has the edge, preventing a decisive reversal. The price is currently reacting negatively to the low volume bar, indicating weakness in the accumulation attempt.

**Key Levels:** Support: 62.84 (Stopping Volume Low), Resistance: 80.00 (Immediate Supply), Resistance: 77.27 (Prior Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Sustained close above $77.27 on high volume, or a break below $62.84.
- **Invalidation:** Close below $62.84
---
### BBVA (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Distribution Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the Weekly flags SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. After a clear Sign of Weakness (SOW) on the last bar (2026-02-02), the market confirms distribution. This bar had extremely high volume (RelVol 2.21), a wide spread down (3.05), and closed poorly (CLV -0.38). Although the close was not at the absolute low, the sheer volume coupled with the wide spread and the break of the recent consolidation zone ($24.88-$26.14) suggests aggressive institutional selling and a change of character in the price action.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 25.42 (Broken Support/Immediate Supply), Support: 23.15 (Recent Low/Demand Zone), Resistance: 26.20 (Supply High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $23.15.
- **Invalidation:** Sustained close above $25.42
---
### BE (NEUTRAL to BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Upthrust Reaction

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH, and the Monthly flags CONFIRMED_EARLY Stopping Volume, suggesting accumulation occurred. However, the price has seen massive volatility and whipsaw at high levels. The last bar (2026-02-02) saw extremely high volume (RelVol 1.10) and a massive spread (44.83), closing poorly (CLV -0.49). This is a potential Upthrust After Distribution (UTAD) or a severe SOW, suggesting that the previous accumulation attempts (if any) have been negated by a new influx of supply. The high volatility and high volume bearish close are significant warning signs.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 167.57 (Distribution High), Support: 131.66 (Recent Low), Resistance: 151.00 (Immediate Supply)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $131.66.
- **Invalidation:** Close above $167.57
---
### BHP (NEUTRAL to BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Effort No Result

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the Weekly flags WATCH_FOR_TEST Buying Climax. Price hit a high of $74.98, followed by extreme volume (RelVol 1.84) on 2026-01-26, coupled with a wide spread and a poor close (CLV -0.67). This is a strong Effort No Result/Sign of Weakness, indicating heavy supply intrusion. The final bar (2026-02-02) saw high volume (RelVol 1.33) and a wide spread, but closed poorly (CLV -0.61). This confirms that supply remains active and prevents any significant follow-through, making distribution highly likely at these high levels.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 74.98 (Climax High/Supply), Support: 68.69 (Immediate Demand), Support: 67.51 (Prior Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $68.69.
- **Invalidation:** Close above $73.64
---
### BKKT (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Demand Reassertion (Potential Spring)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the Monthly flags WATCH_FOR_TEST Buying Climax. The price saw extreme volatility in January, characterized by a massive shakeout bar (2026-01-19, CLV -0.72). The final bar (2026-02-02) saw average volume (RelVol 0.55) and a wide spread, but closed strongly near the high (CLV 0.29). Given the low established at $9.89, this action suggests a Spring event, absorbing trapped sellers and initiating a mark-up. The close, though not exceptional (CLV 0.29), confirms demand dominance over the last candle's range.

**Key Levels:** Support: 9.89 (Spring Low/Accumulation Zone), Resistance: 15.61 (Immediate Supply), Resistance: 22.11 (Climax High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Sustained close above $13.39 (Clearing the prior high close) on strong volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close below $9.89
---
### BRBR (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax/Climactic Action

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar (2026-02-02) shows a very wide spread down, closing near the low, on Ultra-High Volume (RelVol 1.82). This is Climactic Selling. The previous monthly bar (2026-01-01) already indicated Stopping Volume (high volume, wide spread, mixed CLV). This climactic action suggests heavy supply absorption or exhaustion after a significant drop (Quarterly Context BEARISH_TREND). Smart money is likely stepping in, but confirmation (Test/No Supply) is needed. The monthly sequence is STOPPING_VOLUME (CONFIRMED_EARLY), supporting the potential reversal.

**Key Levels:** Support: 19.35 (Weekly Low), Resistance: 24.87 (Previous consolidation low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close above 20.50 on reduced volume, confirming absorption.
- **Invalidation:** 19.35 (Weekly Low)
---
### BROS (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Absorption)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly bar (2026-02-02) shows a wide spread down/up, closing very high (CLV 0.968) on High Volume (RelVol 1.44). This is significant Stopping Volume/Absorption after the major selling climax bar the week prior (2026-01-26, Ultra-High Volume, wide spread, very low CLV). This sequence suggests that strong buying interest entered the market at lower prices (around 51.76).

**Key Levels:** Support: 51.76 (Absorption Low), Resistance: 60.97 (Previous consolidation level)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 57.12 high of the Stopping Volume bar, ideally on strength, or a subsequent test on low volume near 54.00.
- **Invalidation:** 51.76
---
### BRZE (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Climactic Selling Continuation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar (2026-02-02) shows a wide spread down on Ultra-High Volume (RelVol 2.23), closing near the low (CLV -0.789). Although volume is climactic, the lack of positive reaction (closing near the low) indicates the selling pressure is still overwhelming. This is a continuation of the selling seen in the prior two weeks. The Quarterly Context is BEARISH_TREND, favoring continuation.

**Key Levels:** Support: 17.28 (Weekly Low), Resistance: 20.82 (Previous Open/Support turn resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A definitive No Demand/Upthrust confirmation, or a break below 17.28.
- **Invalidation:** 22.12 (High of current bearish bar)
---
### BSX (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar (2026-02-02) shows a massive wide spread down on Ultra-High Volume (RelVol 3.33), closing near the low (CLV -0.854). This is classic climactic selling, indicating massive liquidation. However, such extreme volume often marks exhaustion. Given the Quarterly Context is BEARISH_TREND, this bar sets the stage for a potential short-term reversal, but the selling pressure is profound.

**Key Levels:** Support: 74.86 (Climax Low), Resistance: 91.45 (Previous consolidation support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A subsequent tight spread bar closing mid-to-high, or a test of 74.86 on low volume.
- **Invalidation:** 74.86
---
### BSY (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Change of Behavior (Potential Stopping Volume)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar (2026-02-02) is a wide spread bar (Spread 4.35) with Ultra-High Volume (RelVol 1.467), closing mid-range (CLV 0.012). This action follows significant weakness in the previous week (wide spread down, low CLV). The combination of high volume and a mid-close suggests absorption/stopping volume, interrupting the downward momentum in a BEARISH_TREND. The monthly sequence also shows SUPPLY_DOMINANCE, suggesting we are hunting for a reversal.

**Key Levels:** Support: 30.96 (Weekly Low/Stopping Volume Level), Resistance: 35.31 (Weekly High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A subsequent No Supply bar closing strong, or a break above 35.31.
- **Invalidation:** 30.96
---
### BWIN (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax/Change of Behavior

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar (2026-02-02) shows a wide spread down on Ultra-High Volume (RelVol 1.70), closing mid-low (CLV -0.56). This action is slightly climactic, interrupting the downtrend, but the close is weak. However, the sheer volume spike suggests smart money activity. Given the BEARISH_TREND context, this high volume is likely absorption preceding a potential reversal.

**Key Levels:** Support: 18.62 (Weekly Low), Resistance: 21.86 (Previous support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A rally above 21.92, or a tight test of 18.62 on low volume.
- **Invalidation:** 18.62
---
### BX (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax/Wide Spread Down

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar (2026-02-02) is a very wide spread down bar on Ultra-High Volume (RelVol 2.44), closing mid-low (CLV -0.50). This volume confirms massive selling, suggesting a final flush (Selling Climax). The mid-range close, despite the massive spread, suggests some initial absorption by smart money, but the overall bearish pressure remains strong. The current trend is BEARISH.

**Key Levels:** Support: 125.26 (Climax Low), Resistance: 141.76 (Previous Open)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A subsequent weekly bar closing high above 135 on reduced volume (successful Test).
- **Invalidation:** 125.26
---
### CADE (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax (Follow-through)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The bar for 2026-01-26 showed climactic selling (RelVol 4.79), indicating massive supply dumped into the market, pushing the price down. The last weekly bar (2026-02-02) is a tight spread up/down on high volume (RelVol 1.51), closing mid-low (CLV -0.48). This is not a strong bullish reversal signal, but rather a lack of immediate follow-through selling, typical after a major climax. The Quarterly Context is BULLISH, but the recent monthly buying climax suggests major distribution.

**Key Levels:** Support: 41.59 (Climax Low), Resistance: 43.58 (Weekly High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 43.58 on strength, or a strong push above 45.00.
- **Invalidation:** 41.59
---
### CAI (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Weak Close)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar (2026-02-02) is designated as STOPPING_VOLUME. It shows a wide spread down on Ultra-High Volume (RelVol 1.55), closing mid-low (CLV -0.41). While the high volume suggests smart money interest (absorption), the weak close indicates that sellers still controlled the close, preventing a strong bullish reversal. This suggests the absorption process might take longer.

**Key Levels:** Support: 21.18 (Weekly Low), Resistance: 23.99 (Weekly High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A definitive push above 24.00 on increasing volume, confirming smart money commitment.
- **Invalidation:** 21.18
---
### CCI (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Climactic Action)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar (2026-02-02) is a wide spread down bar on Ultra-High Volume (RelVol 2.12), closing mid-low (CLV -0.24). This is climactic selling. Despite the weak close, the massive volume spike suggests a probable selling exhaustion (Stopping Volume), initiating the reversal process after a significant drop. The Quarterly Context is BEARISH, but this bar suggests a potential short-term bounce.

**Key Levels:** Support: 77.01 (Climax Low), Resistance: 84.68 (Previous consolidation low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A subsequent bar closing strong above 82.00 on reduced volume.
- **Invalidation:** 77.01
---
### CCOI (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Distribution/Upthrust Attempt

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar (2026-02-02) shows a wide spread up/down on High Volume (RelVol 0.82), closing mid-range (CLV 0.22). This volume is high considering the tight recent range, suggesting institutional selling/distribution at the highs (around 25.54). The Monthly BUYING_CLIMAX supports the idea of supply entering the market, despite the BULLISH Quarterly Context.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 25.54 (Distribution High), Support: 22.30 (Weekly Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A break and close below 23.85 (previous week's close) on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** 25.54
---
### CDNS (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax/Absorption

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar (2026-02-02) is a very wide spread bar on Ultra-High Volume (RelVol 2.22). It closes mid-range (CLV 0.23), indicating significant absorption by smart money at the lows (262.75). This is classic Stopping Volume action, particularly after a wide spread down bar the previous week. This suggests the end of the markdown phase in this BEARISH_TREND.

**Key Levels:** Support: 262.75 (Climax Low), Resistance: 296.33 (Weekly High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A subsequent strong close above 296.33, or a low-volume test near 270.00.
- **Invalidation:** 262.75
---
### CIVI (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Potential Distribution)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The bar for 2026-01-26 is a wide spread bar on Ultra-High Volume (RelVol 2.71), closing mid-low (CLV -0.42). This immense volume spike, especially following strong upward movement, suggests heavy institutional distribution (Buying Climax or Upthrust action) near the highs (29.20). The high close in the prior week (2026-01-05) was countered by this large supply entry.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 29.20 (Climax High), Support: 26.63 (Weekly Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A low volume No Demand bar followed by a break below 27.00.
- **Invalidation:** 29.20
---
### CNXC (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume/Absorption

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar (2026-02-02) is a wide spread up bar on High Volume (RelVol 1.32), closing extremely high (CLV 0.946). This action strongly suggests smart money absorption and a successful move away from the recent lows (36.31), interrupting the BEARISH Quarterly Context. This is a clear Change of Behavior (CoB) following significant selling (2026-01-26 wide spread down, low CLV).

**Key Levels:** Support: 36.31 (Absorption Low), Resistance: 43.03 (Previous high)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A low-volume test back to 37.50-38.00, or a break above 40.02.
- **Invalidation:** 36.31
---
### CORT (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Demand Test (Weak Close)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar (2026-02-02) shows a medium spread bar on High Volume (RelVol 1.07), closing mid-range (CLV 0.312). This follows a previous week of high-volume volatility near highs (2026-01-26). Given the Monthly BUYING_CLIMAX, the high volume without a decisive close suggests supply is still present (Effort vs. Result), potentially confirming distribution. The current bar is an ambiguous test of demand.

**Key Levels:** Support: 38.10 (Weekly Low), Resistance: 42.26 (Weekly High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 38.00 on increasing volume (Short), or rally above 42.26 (Long).
- **Invalidation:** 42.26 (If Short setup is considered)
---
### CPNG (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax Continuation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar (2026-02-02) is a wide spread down bar on Ultra-High Volume (RelVol 2.04), closing mid-low (CLV -0.456). Although the spread is wide and volume high (suggesting climactic action), the weak close confirms sellers remain in control, continuing the BEARISH Quarterly/Monthly trend. This is a further sign of weakness (SoW).

**Key Levels:** Support: 16.73 (Weekly Low), Resistance: 20.34 (Weekly High/Previous consolidation resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 16.73 (Continuation Short).
- **Invalidation:** 20.34
---
### CSGP (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax/Change of Behavior

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar (2026-02-02) shows a very wide spread down on Ultra-High Volume (RelVol 1.90), closing mid-low (CLV -0.78). This is classic Selling Climax action, signaling a probable final shakeout and transfer of shares from weak hands to smart money at the lows (48.75). The Quarterly and Monthly contexts are BEARISH, making this climax a key reversal signal.

**Key Levels:** Support: 48.75 (Climax Low), Resistance: 61.46 (Previous Open)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A subsequent tight-spread bar closing high, or a break above 52.00 on demand.
- **Invalidation:** 48.75
---
### DOCU (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax Continuation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar (2026-02-02) is a wide spread down on Ultra-High Volume (RelVol 1.85), closing mid-low (CLV -0.48). This aggressive selling volume suggests supply dominance remains firmly in control, extending the BEARISH Quarterly Trend. Although volume is climactic, the lack of a strong close indicates absorption is either absent or insufficient to reverse the trend yet.

**Key Levels:** Support: 45.00 (Weekly Low), Resistance: 53.28 (Weekly High/Previous open)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 45.00 (Continuation Short).
- **Invalidation:** 53.28
---
### DUOL (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax Continuation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar (2026-02-02) is a very wide spread down bar on Ultra-High Volume (RelVol 2.00), closing mid-low (CLV -0.42). This action confirms continued massive selling and liquidation. Although the volume spike suggests a climax may be near, the weak close indicates supply is still dominant, confirming the strong BEARISH Quarterly/Monthly Trend.

**Key Levels:** Support: 112.41 (Weekly Low), Resistance: 133.88 (Previous Open)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 112.41 (Continuation Short).
- **Invalidation:** 136.54
---
### EGO (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Weak Close)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar (2026-02-02) is a wide spread down on Ultra-High Volume (RelVol 2.08), closing mid-low (CLV -0.04). This bar represents potential Stopping Volume after a sharp decline. The massive volume indicates absorption, but the failure to close strongly suggests supply is still fighting the accumulation effort. The Quarterly Context is BULLISH, suggesting a reversal is probable.

**Key Levels:** Support: 36.40 (Climax Low), Resistance: 41.86 (Weekly High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A subsequent close above 40.00 on reduced volume (Test), or a strong break above 41.86.
- **Invalidation:** 36.40
---
### ENR (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Demand Confirmed (Weak Close)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar (2026-02-02) shows a wide spread up on High Volume (RelVol 1.71), closing mid-range (CLV 0.23). While the high volume suggests demand, the mid-range close indicates selling pressure entered at the highs (24.54). Given the BULLISH Quarterly Context, this is likely a temporary profit-taking/supply check before continuation. The strong monthly context (SUPPLY_DOMINANCE confirmed) suggests this buying is overcoming the prior distribution.

**Key Levels:** Support: 21.56 (Weekly Low), Resistance: 24.54 (Weekly High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 24.54 on renewed strength.
- **Invalidation:** 21.56
---
### ETHA (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax/Absorption

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar (2026-02-02) is a massive wide spread down on Ultra-High Volume (RelVol 1.90), closing mid-range (CLV -0.198). This extreme volume spike confirms a Selling Climax, where smart money is actively absorbing the dumped shares near the 13.77 low. The subsequent market movement should be up (CoB) despite the BEARISH Quarterly Trend.

**Key Levels:** Support: 13.77 (Climax Low), Resistance: 18.11 (Weekly High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A subsequent tight-spread bar closing high on low volume (No Supply Test).
- **Invalidation:** 13.77
---
### EXPE (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar (2026-02-02) shows a huge wide spread down bar on Ultra-High Volume (RelVol 1.97), closing mid-low (CLV -0.49). This massive volume indicates climactic selling, likely signaling exhaustion of supply near the 221.92 low. This is a critical reversal signal against the BEARISH Quarterly Trend. The low close means immediate entry is risky, but the context is bullish reversal.

**Key Levels:** Support: 221.92 (Climax Low), Resistance: 269.47 (Previous Open)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A successful Test bar on low volume, or a break above 240.00.
- **Invalidation:** 221.92
---
### FFIV (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Demand Test (Weak Close)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar (2026-02-02) shows a wide spread bar on lower volume (RelVol 0.73), closing slightly mid-low (CLV -0.064). This follows a huge spread bar up on high volume (2026-01-26). The current bar is essentially a low-volume test after the rally, but the close is not convincing. Given the Monthly STOPPING_VOLUME confirmation, the general bias is bullish, but needs more convincing demand confirmation.

**Key Levels:** Support: 269.07 (Weekly Low), Resistance: 285.08 (Weekly High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A subsequent No Supply bar closing strong, or a break above 285.08.
- **Invalidation:** 269.07
---
### FISV (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume/Absorption

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar (2026-02-02) is a wide spread down bar on High Volume (RelVol 1.11), closing mid-low (CLV -0.258). This marks Stopping Volume/Absorption, as the high volume suggests a significant transfer of shares at the low (57.79). This action halts the sharp decline from the previous week and occurs in a context of monthly SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (suggesting distribution exhaustion).

**Key Levels:** Support: 57.79 (Climax Low), Resistance: 63.75 (Weekly High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A subsequent strong close above 61.00 on demand.
- **Invalidation:** 57.79
---
### GKOS (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Demand Test (Weak Close)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar (2026-02-02) is a wide spread bar on low volume (RelVol 0.74), closing near the low (CLV -0.66). This is a test of demand/supply that failed to attract significant buying interest, showing inherent weakness despite the recent rally. The monthly context is BUYING_CLIMAX, suggesting distribution is active. This weak test supports the bearish potential.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 121.74 (Weekly High), Support: 110.65 (Weekly Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 110.65 on increasing volume (Short).
- **Invalidation:** 121.74
---
### GNTX (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Demand Resumes (Weak Close)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar (2026-02-02) is a wide spread up bar on High Volume (RelVol 1.42), closing mid-range (CLV 0.135). The high volume suggests strong demand, but the failure to close high indicates supply entering at the upper half of the bar (around 25.13). Given the Monthly SUPPLY_DOMINANCE confirmation, this is a crucial bar confirming demand is present, but it needs stronger follow-through.

**Key Levels:** Support: 22.78 (Weekly Low), Resistance: 25.14 (Weekly High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close above 25.14 on strength.
- **Invalidation:** 22.78
---
### GWRE (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax Continuation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar (2026-02-02) is a wide spread down bar on Ultra-High Volume (RelVol 2.22), closing mid-low (CLV -0.378). This confirms continued heavy selling, extending the bear move and overwhelming the market. The high volume suggests a climax is in process, but the weak close means supply is dominant. BEARISH Quarterly Trend favors downside continuation.

**Key Levels:** Support: 121.87 (Weekly Low), Resistance: 140.01 (Previous Open/Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 121.87 (Continuation Short).
- **Invalidation:** 142.18
---
### HPQ (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Weak Close)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar (2026-02-02) is a wide spread bar on Ultra-High Volume (RelVol 1.90), closing mid-range (CLV 0.192). The massive volume spike suggests stopping volume/absorption at the lows (18.31). However, the weak close indicates persistent supply pressure. The Monthly SUPPLY_DOMINANCE confirms institutional weakness, so any bounce might be short-lived unless confirmed by a strong subsequent bar.

**Key Levels:** Support: 18.31 (Climax Low), Resistance: 20.55 (Weekly High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A subsequent tight spread bar closing high on low volume (No Supply Test).
- **Invalidation:** 18.31
---
### ING (NEUTRAL/CAUTIOUS BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Upthrust/Supply Check

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar (2026-02-02) shows a wide spread up/down on Ultra-High Volume (RelVol 1.94), closing mid-low (CLV -0.28). This volume spike near the highs (31.18) suggests a significant influx of supply (potential Upthrust or distribution), halting the upward momentum despite the BULLISH Quarterly Context. The prior 'BUYING_CLIMAX' detection supports the notion of institutional selling.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 31.18 (Upthrust High), Support: 29.44 (Weekly Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 29.44 on increasing volume (Short).
- **Invalidation:** 31.18
---
### INVH (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
The latest weekly bar shows high relative volume (1.31), a wide spread, and the close is near the middle/high (CLV 0.134), slightly rejecting the low of $25.58. This occurs after a huge Stopping Volume bar (Week 1, RelVol 2.568) and subsequent attempts to drive the price down on average volume. The presence of Stopping Volume on both weekly and monthly charts, following a Bearish Quarterly trend, indicates Smart Money accumulating at lower prices, specifically near the $25.29 support area. The latest weekly bar suggests absorption near the lows, setting up for a test.

**Key Levels:** $25.29 (Major Support/Stopping Volume Low), $26.73 (Recent Resistance), $28.34 (Previous High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A low-volume Test of the $25.50 - $26.00 area, followed by a confirmed bullish bar.
- **Invalidation:** $25.29 (Break below the low of the Stopping Volume bar)
---
### IOT (NEUTRAL/EARLY BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
IOT is in a Quarterly Bearish Trend, but the weekly chart shows Stopping Volume behavior (Algo Detection confirmed). The latest bar shows ultra-high volume (RelVol 2.293) on a wide spread, with the close slightly off the absolute low (CLV -0.099), suggesting Smart Money stepped in to absorb supply near the $23.38 level. This is a potential preliminary sign of support (PS) following aggressive downward movement (previous week showed high volume/wide spread closing near the low, CLV -0.917). We must now wait for a subsequent Test to confirm absorption.

**Key Levels:** $23.38 (Stopping Volume Low/Initial Support), $27.84 (Immediate Resistance), $32.79 (Prior Consolidation Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A low-volume Test of the $24.00 - $25.00 zone, failing to break the $23.38 low.
- **Invalidation:** $23.38 (Break below the low of the Stopping Volume bar)
---
### JPM (NEUTRAL/MIXED)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Effort Result

**Smart Money Logic:**
JPM shows complex action within a Bullish Quarterly Trend. The previous three weeks showed Supply Dominance and heavy selling (RelVol 1.998, 1.005), but the latest weekly bar exhibits high volume (RelVol 1.150), a wide spread, and a strong close near the high (CLV 0.838). This suggests aggressive buying interest stepped in, reversing the recent supply. This is a successful Sign of Strength (SOS) following distribution. However, the Monthly data shows the previous bar closed near the low, keeping the monthly Supply Dominance alert active. This weekly rally needs confirmation.

**Key Levels:** $301.37 (Key Support/Stop Loss area), $308.00 (Minor Resistance), $324.24 (Current High/Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a low-volume Test of the recent breakout level, ideally around $315-$318.
- **Invalidation:** $301.37 (Break below the low of the latest SOS bar)
---
### KDP (NEUTRAL/WATCH FOR WEAKNESS)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly chart flagged a Confirmed Early Buying Climax. While the weekly volume (RelVol 0.615) is average, the latest bar is a wide up-bar closing strongly (CLV 0.613), pushing price toward the previous high ($28.70). In the context of a Buying Climax, this bullish effort without strong corresponding volume amplification often suggests dwindling demand or 'Effort without Corresponding Result,' especially if the monthly structure points to distribution.

**Key Levels:** $28.70 (Resistance/Climax High), $27.20 (Immediate Support), $26.40 (Stronger Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A No Demand bar failure near $28.70 resistance, or a low-volume break below $27.20.
- **Invalidation:** $28.70 (New high followed by weak close)
---
### LHX (NEUTRAL/WATCH FOR WEAKNESS)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Effort No Result

**Smart Money Logic:**
LHX is in a Bullish Quarterly Trend but signaled a weekly Buying Climax. The recent weekly bar shows high volume (RelVol 1.127) but a moderate spread, closing slightly above the middle (CLV 0.378). Compared to the previous high-volume bars, this is diminished bullish response (Effort but diminishing Result). The prior two weeks exhibited volatility (wide spreads, negative CLVs) indicating distribution. The latest bar suggests a hesitation or lack of follow-through after the initial climax.

**Key Levels:** $369.59 (Climax High/Resistance), $335.63 (Immediate Support), $342.85 (Prior Close/Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A break below $335.63 on increased volume, confirming weakness.
- **Invalidation:** $369.59 (Break and close significantly above the climax high)
---
### MTCH (NEUTRAL/WATCH FOR WEAKNESS)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly chart flagged a Buying Climax. The latest bar shows high volume (RelVol 2.193) on a wide spread, with the close in the upper half (CLV 0.228). This suggests significant buying effort, but the wide spread indicates volatility and the close is only moderate, hinting at underlying weakness or selling pressure countering the effort. Given the Bearish Quarterly trend, this may be a secondary Buying Climax or accumulation after a shakeout low ($28.81). We need a clear Test to confirm direction.

**Key Levels:** $33.40 (Climax High/Resistance), $28.81 (Immediate Support/Shakeout Low), $31.00 (Breakout Point)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A low-volume Test (No Supply) of the $30.00 - $31.00 level.
- **Invalidation:** $28.81 (Break below the low of the bar)
---
### NET (NEUTRAL/EARLY BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly chart flagged Stopping Volume (SV). The latest bar shows extreme volume (RelVol 2.048) on a wide spread, with the close near the middle/high (CLV 0.034). This volume confirms institutional absorption of selling pressure, specifically around the $160.35 low. This SV follows a previous week of extreme Supply Dominance (RelVol 2.789, CLV -0.894), suggesting Smart Money is establishing Preliminary Support (PS) and potentially building a base in this Bearish Quarterly context.

**Key Levels:** $160.35 (Stopping Volume Low/Support), $185.22 (Immediate Resistance), $177.35 (Previous Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A low-volume Test of the $165.00 - $170.00 area.
- **Invalidation:** $160.35 (Break below the SV low)
---
### NFXL (NEUTRAL/EARLY BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly chart signaled Stopping Volume. The latest bar shows volume (RelVol 1.304) on a wide spread, closing near the middle/low (CLV -0.053). This action follows significant selling and is attempting to hold support. The volume is high enough to indicate smart money stepping in, absorbing supply around $21.53. The previous extreme volume bar (RelVol 3.336) closing near the middle suggests earlier strong absorption. The current bar is likely a continuation of Preliminary Support (PS) in a developing accumulation zone.

**Key Levels:** $21.53 (Stopping Volume Low/Support), $23.95 (Prior Low/Resistance), $25.00 (Recent High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A clear Test (No Supply) on reduced volume that holds the $21.53 support.
- **Invalidation:** $21.53 (Break below the low of the bar)
---
### NXPI (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
Within a Bullish Quarterly Trend, NXPI experienced a sharp pullback but showed immediate absorption. The latest weekly bar displays ultra-high volume (RelVol 1.889) on a wide spread, closing well off the low (CLV 0.278), confirming Stopping Volume activity near $207.01. This action suggests that the professional operators defended the prior accumulation levels and absorbed the panic selling.

**Key Levels:** $207.01 (Stopping Volume Low/Support), $234.09 (Immediate Resistance), $224.55 (Breakout Point)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A subsequent low-volume Test (No Supply) of the $215.00 - $220.00 level.
- **Invalidation:** $207.01 (Break below the SV low)
---
### NYT (NEUTRAL/EARLY BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly bar shows massive volume (RelVol 2.895) on an extremely wide spread, signaling climactic selling. However, the close is significantly off the absolute low (CLV 0.218), indicating that Smart Money stepped in aggressively to absorb the supply, marking this as Stopping Volume (SV) near $58.87. This SV is powerful given the Quarterly Bearish Trend and suggests a potential change of character after this sharp decline.

**Key Levels:** $58.87 (Stopping Volume Low/Support), $71.96 (Prior Resistance), $74.04 (Recent High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A low-volume Test of the $60.00 - $63.00 range, confirming absorption.
- **Invalidation:** $58.87 (Break below the SV low)
---
### PAGP (NEUTRAL/WATCH FOR WEAKNESS)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
PAGP is in a Bullish Quarterly Trend but shows characteristics of a Buying Climax (BC). The latest weekly bar has high volume (RelVol 1.860) on a wide spread, but the close is only slightly above the middle (CLV 0.063). This is 'Effort without Corresponding Result' on the high volume, suggesting heavy supply is entering the market, neutralizing the upward momentum near the high ($21.23). The previous weeks also show inconsistent closes despite high volume.

**Key Levels:** $21.23 (Climax High/Resistance), $20.12 (Immediate Support), $19.68 (Stronger Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A low-volume Test (No Demand) failing near $21.00 or a break below $20.12 on increased volume.
- **Invalidation:** $21.23 (New high followed by weak close)
---
### PGY (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
PGY is confirming the Monthly Supply Dominance signal. The latest weekly bar shows high volume (RelVol 1.339) on a wide spread, closing slightly above the middle (CLV 0.052). While the moderate close suggests a partial rejection of the extreme low ($16.55), the high volume and wide spread confirm that distribution is aggressive. The overall structure indicates persistent supply dominance in the Quarterly Bearish Trend.

**Key Levels:** $19.12 (Immediate Resistance), $16.55 (Low of the Bar/Support), $20.52 (Recent High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A rally failure (No Demand) near $19.50, or a break below $16.55.
- **Invalidation:** $20.52 (Above the high of the latest supply bar)
---
### PPL (NEUTRAL/EARLY BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
PPL, within a Bullish Quarterly Trend, shows a potential absorption pattern. The latest weekly bar has ultra-high volume (RelVol 1.862) and a moderate spread, closing slightly above the middle (CLV 0.123). This volume, after several weeks of lower closes, suggests Smart Money absorbed sellers near the $35.10 low. This is a preliminary indication of support (PS) following a downward thrust.

**Key Levels:** $35.10 (Support/Stopping Volume Low), $36.56 (Immediate Resistance), $37.07 (Prior High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A low-volume Test (No Supply) of the $35.50 - $35.70 area.
- **Invalidation:** $35.10 (Break below the SV low)
---
### PTC (NEUTRAL/EARLY BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
PTC, in a Bearish Quarterly Trend, showed heavy selling but strong absorption in the latest bar. Volume is very high (RelVol 2.201) on a wide spread, with the close significantly off the low (CLV 0.412). This confirms Stopping Volume activity, indicating Smart Money absorbed supply near the $146.72 low. This action interrupts the consistent bearish sequence seen in the preceding bars.

**Key Levels:** $146.72 (Stopping Volume Low/Support), $159.46 (Immediate Resistance), $165.94 (Prior High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A low-volume Test (No Supply) of the $150.00 - $152.00 area.
- **Invalidation:** $146.72 (Break below the SV low)
---
### PTGX (NEUTRAL/WATCH FOR WEAKNESS)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
PTGX confirmed an Early Buying Climax on the monthly chart. The latest weekly bar shows average volume (RelVol 0.894) on a moderate spread, closing in the upper half (CLV 0.455). Although the Quarterly Trend is Bearish, the price is holding up near the highs established in the prior month. The buying effort is evident, but the lack of follow-through strength or break of recent resistance ($86.10) suggests selling pressure is neutralizing demand, confirming the climax structure.

**Key Levels:** $86.10 (Resistance/Climax High), $80.20 (Immediate Support), $77.69 (Stronger Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A clear No Demand signal near $86.00 resistance, or a low-volume break below $80.20.
- **Invalidation:** $86.10 (New high followed by weak close)
---
### QQQI (NEUTRAL/WATCH FOR WEAKNESS)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Effort No Result

**Smart Money Logic:**
QQQI confirmed a Buying Climax on the monthly chart. The latest weekly bar has high volume (RelVol 1.731) and a wide spread, but the close is near the low (CLV -0.032), indicating 'Effort without Corresponding Result'. Despite significant effort, buying failed to sustain the price move, suggesting heavy supply entered the market near the $54.35 high. This distribution aligns with the monthly Buying Climax warning, despite the Bullish Quarterly Trend.

**Key Levels:** $54.35 (Climax High/Resistance), $51.83 (Immediate Support), $53.56 (Prior Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A break and close below $51.83 on increased volume, confirming distribution.
- **Invalidation:** $54.35 (New high followed by weak close)
---
### RARE (NEUTRAL/WATCH FOR WEAKNESS)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
RARE is struggling despite a Bullish Quarterly Trend and a recent Sign of Strength. The latest weekly bar has high volume (RelVol 1.197) and a moderate spread, closing near the open/middle (CLV 0.008). This ambiguity, following a prior Supply Dominance bar (CLV -0.068), suggests that demand is unable to push the price higher effectively. The monthly chart confirmed an Early Supply Dominance signal, making the current action suspect, likely indicating a trading range or consolidation where distribution is ongoing.

**Key Levels:** $25.82 (Recent High/Resistance), $23.56 (Immediate Support), $22.00 (Stronger Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A low-volume Test (No Supply) failing to break $23.56, or a strong push above $25.82.
- **Invalidation:** $23.56 (Break below the low of the bar)
---
### RGLD (NEUTRAL/WATCH FOR WEAKNESS)
**VSA Status:** Test of Supply / Weakness

**Smart Money Logic:**
RGLD, within a Bullish Quarterly Trend, shows signs of distribution after a sharp rally. The latest weekly bar has average volume (RelVol 1.053) and a moderate spread, closing slightly above the middle (CLV 0.119). This follows a major Supply Dominance bar (Week 4, RelVol 1.126, CLV -0.801). The current bar is essentially a low-volume test of the supply that entered last week, but the close is not convincing enough to confirm bullish control. Given the Monthly Supply Dominance signal, caution is advised.

**Key Levels:** $275.66 (Resistance), $253.20 (Support/Test Low), $299.01 (Prior High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $276.00 on high volume for bullish continuation, or a break below $253.20 for weakness.
- **Invalidation:** $253.20 (Break below the low of the test bar)
---
### RGTI (NEUTRAL/EARLY BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Reversal

**Smart Money Logic:**
RGTI confirmed a Buying Climax on the monthly chart, but the latest weekly bar shows a sharp reversal attempt following extreme selling. Volume is high (RelVol 0.551) on a moderate spread, closing strongly near the high (CLV 0.622). This suggests strong demand stepped in to absorb supply near the $14.83 low, acting as Stopping Volume (SV) after significant liquidation. Given the bearish quarterly trend, this is a positive 'Change of Character' (ChOC).

**Key Levels:** $14.83 (Support/Stopping Volume Low), $18.38 (Immediate Resistance/Recent High), $23.43 (Prior Breakdown Level)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A low-volume Test (No Supply) of the $16.00 - $17.00 area.
- **Invalidation:** $14.83 (Break below the SV low)
---
### RTO (NEUTRAL/WATCH FOR WEAKNESS)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
RTO is operating within a Bullish Quarterly Trend but shows climax characteristics. The latest weekly bar features ultra-high volume (RelVol 2.856) on a moderate spread, closing near the middle (CLV 0.203). This high volume with only moderate upward progress suggests 'Effort without Corresponding Result,' indicating aggressive institutional selling (distribution) has entered the market near the highs ($32.69), neutralizing the demand. This validates the weekly Buying Climax alert.

**Key Levels:** $33.46 (Climax High/Resistance), $31.36 (Immediate Support), $32.69 (Recent High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A low-volume Test (No Demand) failing near $32.50, or a break below $31.36 on increased volume.
- **Invalidation:** $33.46 (New high followed by weak close)
---
### RVMD (NEUTRAL/WATCH FOR WEAKNESS)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
RVMD confirmed a Buying Climax on the monthly chart following an initial extreme run-up (Week 1, RelVol 4.206). The latest weekly bar has average volume (RelVol 0.795) and a moderate spread, closing in the upper half (CLV 0.362). This bar represents a Test of the supply introduced during the recent shakeout low (Week 4, low $92.50). While the high close is positive, the low volume on this Test suggests Smart Money might be allowing a minor rally before continuing distribution in line with the Buying Climax structure.

**Key Levels:** $99.58 (Immediate Resistance), $93.02 (Support/Test Low), $101.93 (Prior High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A failure (No Demand) near $100.00, or a break above $99.58 on high volume.
- **Invalidation:** $93.02 (Break below the low of the test bar)
---
### RYAAY (NEUTRAL/EARLY BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
RYAAY, in a Bearish Quarterly Trend, shows potential absorption. The latest weekly bar has high volume (RelVol 1.134) on a wide spread, closing near the middle/low (CLV -0.484). This volume surge follows sustained selling, indicating Smart Money has stepped in to absorb supply near the $67.24 low, marking Stopping Volume. This provides a clear area of Preliminary Support (PS).

**Key Levels:** $67.24 (Stopping Volume Low/Support), $72.56 (Immediate Resistance), $71.36 (Prior High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A low-volume Test (No Supply) of the $68.00 - $69.00 area.
- **Invalidation:** $67.24 (Break below the SV low)
---
### RYN (NEUTRAL/WATCH FOR WEAKNESS)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
RYN is alerted for both weekly Supply Dominance and monthly Buying Climax, suggesting distribution is active despite the Bullish Quarterly Trend. The latest bar has very high volume (RelVol 2.012) but a narrow spread, closing near the low (CLV -0.600). This is 'Effort without Corresponding Result' or a failed Test of Supply. The high volume confirms that sellers are aggressively neutralizing any demand near the current support level, putting pressure on the recent base ($22.33).

**Key Levels:** $22.98 (Immediate Resistance), $22.33 (Support/Test Low), $24.01 (Prior High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A decisive break and close below $22.33 on increased volume, confirming liquidation.
- **Invalidation:** $22.98 (Above the high of the latest bar)
---
### SA (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Reversal Attempt/Spring in Support Area

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stock experienced a wide spread down (Wider spread, CLV -0.97) on high relative volume (1.46) in the week of 1/26, confirming monthly supply dominance. However, the next week (2/2) saw an aggressive reversal bar (Up bar, CLV 0.55) with high relative volume (1.03) that pushed the close significantly off the low (Low: 27.41, Close: 30.00). This suggests stopping volume/buying absorption at the quarterly bullish support area, potentially signaling a spring action below 28.13.

**Key Levels:** 28.00 (Immediate Support/Spring Zone), 32.50 (Recent Resistance), 37.99 (High/Previous Supply)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 31.00 or a successful Test of the 28.00 level on very low volume (No Supply).
- **Invalidation:** 27.00 (Below recent low 27.41)
---
### SARO (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Confirmed)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The week of 1/26 showed extreme volume (4.29 RelVol) on a wide down bar (CLV -0.91), indicating potential Buying Climax exhaustion followed by Supply Dominance. However, the subsequent bar (2/2) was an up bar with a wide spread and very high volume (1.84 RelVol, CLV 0.51), closing near the middle. This massive volume absorption (Stopping Volume) after a steep decline (post-1/19 rally) suggests strong accumulation by Smart Money near the 30.00 support zone. The weekly sequence confirms a WATCH_FOR_TEST stage.

**Key Levels:** 28.60 (Swing Low Support), 30.70 (Recent Bounce Level), 32.50 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Test of 29.50-30.00 area on ultra-low volume (No Demand/Supply) or breakout above 32.50.
- **Invalidation:** 28.50 (Below Stopping Volume low)
---
### SONY (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance/Churning

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly context is Bearish. The last two weeks (1/26 and 2/2) saw very high volume (1.83 and 2.19 RelVol) suggesting Smart Money activity. The 1/26 bar closed near the low (CLV -0.54) confirming strong selling. The 2/2 bar, however, saw the highest volume yet, but closed well off the low (CLV 0.30) with a wide spread. This indicates churning—intense battle between supply and aggressive counter-buying near the 21.80 area. While Supply Dominance is detected, the massive volume absorption suggests a possible short-term effort to halt the decline, though the quarterly trend remains bearish.

**Key Levels:** 21.80 (Low Support/Churning Zone), 23.10 (Immediate Resistance), 25.00 (Key Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 23.10 (Demand) or break below 21.80 (Supply continuation).
- **Invalidation:** 21.00 (For short bias)/24.00 (For long confirmation)
---
### SPOT (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance/Final Shakeout

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is bearish. The week of 2/2 showed extreme volume (2.51 RelVol) and an extremely wide spread down (107.28 points), closing near the low (CLV -0.67). This is a massive shakeout, confirming intense Supply Dominance and potential capitulation. The volatility suggests Smart Money is driving price violently lower, likely clearing out weak hands before any potential major reversal, but currently, supply controls the market.

**Key Levels:** 500.00 (Psychological/Recent Support), 405.00 (Capitulation Low), 520.00 (Overhead Supply)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** If short, wait for a bounce and retest of 500. If long, require a strong Test on ultra-low volume near 405.
- **Invalidation:** 517.00 (Immediate reversal sign)
---
### SSNC (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Confirmed)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stock is in a bearish quarterly trend, but the last weekly bar (2/2) delivered a clear Stopping Volume signal. Volume spiked dramatically (2.80 RelVol) on a wide spread, but the price closed well off the absolute low of 70.89 (CLV 0.09). This huge influx of volume below the 80.00 level signals aggressive absorption by Smart Money, attempting to halt the sustained downtrend and likely initiating a preliminary accumulation phase.

**Key Levels:** 70.90 (Stopping Volume Low), 78.00 (Immediate Resistance), 81.50 (Prior Support/Current Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Successful Test of the 70.90-72.00 area on ultra-low volume (No Supply).
- **Invalidation:** 70.00 (Break below Stopping Volume low)
---
### STAA (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Confirmed Early)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The sequence is clearly bearish, leading into the recent low. The last weekly bar (2/2) saw high volume (1.17 RelVol) and a wide spread, but the close was near the middle/low (CLV -0.37). While the CLV is negative, the bar immediately follows several weeks of sharp selling, and the volume is elevated around the 17.00 zone. Since the weekly sequence confirms Stopping Volume (CONFIRMED_EARLY), Smart Money is likely absorbing supply, despite the negative CLV. This bar functions as Preliminary Support/Stopping Volume. Need a clear follow-through of demand.

**Key Levels:** 16.94 (Stopping Volume Low), 19.00 (Immediate Resistance), 20.50 (Breakout Level)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 19.00 on strong volume or a successful No Supply test of 17.00.
- **Invalidation:** 16.50 (Below the Stopping Volume low)
---
### SYF (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance/Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is bearish. The week of 1/26 showed high volume (2.13 RelVol) and a wide spread down, closing near the low (CLV -0.72), confirming Supply Dominance. The subsequent week (2/2), however, saw high volume (1.16 RelVol) on an up-bar with a narrow spread (3.6 points) but closing near the high (CLV 0.62). This suggests that Smart Money stepped in aggressively to absorb selling and initiate a potential relief rally, indicating Preliminary Support near 72.22.

**Key Levels:** 72.22 (Preliminary Support), 77.00 (Immediate Resistance), 80.00 (Major Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 77.00 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** 71.50 (Below Preliminary Support)
---
### TROW (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance/Churning

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is bearish. The last week (2/2) showed massive volume (2.12 RelVol) on an extremely wide down bar (15.51 spread). Despite the size, the close was well off the low (CLV -0.62), suggesting intense selling pressure (Supply) met with aggressive counter-buying (Stopping Volume/Churning). While Smart Money may be accumulating, the extreme volume and the wide spread down indicate that the selling climax is painful and requires confirmation of demand absorption.

**Key Levels:** 91.70 (Capitulation Low), 95.00 (Immediate Resistance), 103.50 (Overhead Supply)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Requires a subsequent low volume Test (No Supply) near 91.70, or sustained break above 100.00.
- **Invalidation:** 91.00 (Below recent low)
---
### TRU (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Confirmed Strong)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly sequence confirms a strong Stopping Volume. The last weekly bar (2/2) saw extremely high volume (1.70 RelVol) on a wide spread down, but the CLV was positive (0.12), indicating a close above the midpoint and well off the absolute low of 65.23. This is a classic Preliminary Support/Stopping Volume bar, signaling that Smart Money aggressively bought into the heavy selling, halting the previous decline from 89.00.

**Key Levels:** 65.23 (Stopping Volume Low), 75.00 (Immediate Resistance), 79.00 (Previous Support/Current Supply)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A low volume Test of the 67.00-70.00 area (No Supply) or a break above 75.00.
- **Invalidation:** 65.00 (Below Stopping Volume low)
---
### UBER (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance/Churning

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stock is in a confirmed bearish quarterly trend. The last bar (2/2) showed extremely high volume (1.86 RelVol) on a very wide spread down (10.01 points). The close was negative (CLV -0.42), but significantly off the low of 71.88. This indicates intense selling pressure (Supply Dominance) combined with active accumulation (Churning) near 72.00. While accumulation may be starting, the immediate Supply Dominance detected suggests bears still control the price action.

**Key Levels:** 71.88 (Preliminary Support), 80.00 (Immediate Supply Zone), 86.00 (Overhead Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Requires a decisive No Supply Test near 72.00, or a clear failure below 71.88 for short continuation.
- **Invalidation:** 71.00 (If short) / 81.00 (If seeking reversal)
---
### UNH (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance/Capitulation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is bearish. The week of 1/26 was an extreme capitulation bar: massive volume (2.97 RelVol), widest spread in 5 weeks (74.39 points), closing near the low (CLV -0.82). The latest bar (2/2) continued this bearish move, seeing high volume (1.31 RelVol) on a wide down spread, closing near the middle/low (CLV -0.14). The sheer magnitude of supply suggests the downtrend is violent and likely requires a period of stabilization/accumulation before recovery. Currently, supply is overwhelming.

**Key Levels:** 266.30 (Capitulation Low), 290.00 (Immediate Resistance), 330.00 (Major Supply Zone)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Requires a low volume Test below 270.00 (No Supply) for a long position. Short setup triggered below 266.30.
- **Invalidation:** 295.00 (If short) / 265.00 (If long)
---
### VLTO (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance/Capitulation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is bearish. The last weekly bar (2/2) showed massive volume (2.18 RelVol) on a wide spread down (13.10 points), closing near the low (CLV -0.66). This is a strong Supply Dominance signal, indicating capitulation and intense selling pressure by Smart Money. Price broke key support levels (below 97.00) on devastating volume. The market remains firmly in distribution/markdown.

**Key Levels:** 88.40 (Capitulation Low), 97.00 (Key Resistance), 100.00 (Psychological Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Requires a low volume Test (No Supply) near 88.40 for a long reversal setup, or short continuation upon break of 88.40.
- **Invalidation:** 95.00 (If short) / 87.00 (If long)
---
### VONG (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance/Churning

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is bearish, but the monthly sequence points to early Stopping Volume. The last weekly bar (2/2) saw high volume (1.52 RelVol) on a wide spread, but the close was near the low (CLV -0.04). This confirms ongoing distribution or churning around the 117.50 level. Volume is elevated, yet the price struggle suggests a battle between bears driving the price down and bulls absorbing supply. No clear immediate direction is established.

**Key Levels:** 114.50 (Recent Low/Churning Support), 120.00 (Psychological Resistance), 123.60 (Overhead Supply)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 120.50 (Demand) or break below 114.50 (Supply continuation).
- **Invalidation:** 114.00 (If long) / 121.00 (If short)
---
### WGMI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax/Supply Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly sequence confirms a Buying Climax. The week of 1/26 showed high volume (1.15 RelVol) on a wide spread down, closing near the low (CLV -0.82), confirming heavy supply. The subsequent bar (2/2) was a massive down bar (11.63 spread) on extremely high volume (1.63 RelVol), confirming the supply impulse. Although the CLV (-0.06) is near the middle, the sheer force and volume on the drop from 52.00 suggest a major distribution phase is complete, and the markdown is in progress.

**Key Levels:** 34.99 (Low/Capitulation Zone), 44.00 (Immediate Resistance), 52.00 (Climax High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Requires a low volume Test (No Supply) near 35.00 for reversal, or short continuation below 34.99.
- **Invalidation:** 46.00 (If short) / 34.50 (If long)
---
### WMG (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Confirmed)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The bearish quarterly trend led to a strong stopping action in the last week (2/2). Volume spiked dramatically (2.34 RelVol) on a very wide spread down (3.98 points). Crucially, the close was significantly off the low of 26.42 (CLV 0.32), indicating aggressive absorption of supply by Smart Money. This is a clear Preliminary Support/Stopping Volume bar, suggesting the decline is being arrested near the 26.42 level.

**Key Levels:** 26.42 (Stopping Volume Low), 30.00 (Immediate Resistance), 31.62 (Overhead Supply)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Low volume Test of the 27.00-28.00 zone (No Supply) or break above 30.00.
- **Invalidation:** 26.00 (Below Stopping Volume low)
---
### WPM (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance/Churning

**Smart Money Logic:**
The bullish quarterly trend was interrupted by a Buying Climax. The week of 1/26 showed extreme Supply Dominance (1.92 RelVol, wide spread, CLV -0.89). The latest week (2/2) saw continued high volume (1.45 RelVol) but the bar was an up-bar closing slightly above the midpoint (CLV 0.12). This indicates intense churning—Smart Money is buying into the sharp sell-off, creating a temporary halt. The market is consolidating after major distribution.

**Key Levels:** 129.12 (Churning Support), 136.00 (Immediate Resistance), 152.00 (Breakdown Level)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Decisive Test of 130.00 on low volume, or a break above 138.00 (Demand confirmation).
- **Invalidation:** 128.00 (Below churning support)
---
### Z (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance/Capitulation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is bearish. The week of 1/26 showed Supply Dominance (CLV -0.90). The latest weekly bar (2/2) confirmed capitulation with extremely high volume (2.09 RelVol) on a wide spread down, closing very poorly (CLV -0.74). This is overwhelming supply, driving the price from 63.00 to 54.97, confirming that Smart Money is aggressively liquidating or initiating a strong markdown phase.

**Key Levels:** 53.61 (Capitulation Low), 63.00 (Immediate Resistance/Breakdown), 68.00 (Overhead Supply)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short continuation below 53.60. Long setup requires a significant low volume Test (No Supply) near 54.00.
- **Invalidation:** 60.00 (If short) / 53.00 (If long)
---
### ZM (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax/Churning

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence shows a Buying Climax. The week of 1/26 saw high volume (2.00 RelVol) on a wide bar, closing slightly off the high (CLV 0.019), indicating aggressive supply entering the market following the rally. The latest bar (2/2) also saw high volume (1.68 RelVol) on a wide bar, closing near the midpoint/high (CLV 0.41). This indicates intense churning and absorption near the recent high, suggesting distribution is taking place, but demand is still fighting hard to maintain levels above 90.00.

**Key Levels:** 87.20 (Churning Support), 94.30 (Immediate Resistance), 97.58 (Climax High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 94.50 (Demand confirmation) or break below 87.00 (Distribution confirmation).
- **Invalidation:** 98.00 (If long) / 86.00 (If short)

## Other
### AMH (NEUTRAL to BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Absorption)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH, but both the Weekly and Monthly sequences signal WATCH_FOR_TEST/CONFIRMED_EARLY Stopping Volume. Price volatility has narrowed significantly over the last three weeks around $31. The latest bar (2026-02-02) saw high volume (RelVol 1.14) but a narrow spread and a close near the middle (CLV 0.014). This action, specifically testing the prior low of $30.13, suggests absorption of sellers (Stopping Volume confirmed). The overall selling momentum has stalled at this level. This confirms the market is likely setting up for an accumulation phase.

**Key Levels:** Support: 30.13 (Stopping Volume Low), Resistance: 32.45 (Supply Line), Resistance: 31.53 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Sustained low volume rally above $31.53 (No Supply Test).
- **Invalidation:** Close below $30.13
---
### IONQ (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax Followed by Down-Move

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly chart flagged a Buying Climax, and the subsequent weekly action confirms aggressive weakness. The past two weeks show ultra-high volume (RelVol 1.027 and 1.137) with wide spreads closing near the low (CLV -0.817 and -0.068), indicating heavy supply saturation and liquidation. The recent sharp down bar on high volume confirms the aggressive distribution noted in the monthly Buying Climax. The close of the latest weekly bar ($34.99) is near the middle of its wide spread, suggesting some minor absorption, but the overall context remains overwhelmingly bearish.

**Key Levels:** $45.69 (Breakdown Level), $38.91 (Recent Low/Resistance), $29.99 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A low-volume rally (Test) back towards $38.90 resistance/breakdown level.
- **Invalidation:** $40.73 (Above the high of the latest weekly bar)
---
### IONX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Climactic Selling

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence shows aggressive selling amplification. Volume has been accelerating significantly (RelVol up to 2.421) across the last three weeks, accompanied by wide spreads closing at or near the lows, confirming relentless Supply Dominance. The latest bar is a climactic selling event (high volume, wide spread, CLV -0.258, suggesting marginal close off the absolute low), which might indicate an exhaustion point, but the immediate bearish trend is confirmed. The monthly context is also extremely bearish.

### IQV (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Climactic Selling

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stock has been under persistent pressure, culminating in a huge capitulation bar this week. Volume spiked dramatically (RelVol 2.279), accompanied by an ultra-wide spread, confirming climactic supply. The close is near the middle-low (CLV -0.602), showing strong selling pressure overcame any immediate absorption. The previous bar was already marked as Supply Dominance. While the volume surge suggests potential exhaustion, the severity of the price drop (down ~$43 from open) confirms institutional liquidation. The quarterly context is bearish.

**Key Levels:** $176.07 (Climactic Low), $227.99 (Prior Support/Current Resistance), $233.48 (Recent High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for clear accumulation patterns (e.g., No Supply Test on lower timeframes) around the $176-$180 zone.
- **Invalidation:** N/A (Too volatile; need stable base first)

### IREN (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Climactic Selling

**Smart Money Logic:**

The price dropped significantly from $55.72 to $36.52. This massive liquidation confirms the Monthly Supply Dominance signal. This is a potential blow-off top scenario following the run-up in January.

**Key Levels:** $51.78 (Key Breakdown/Resistance), $36.52 (Climactic Low/Support), $63.59 (All-time High/Major Resistance)
