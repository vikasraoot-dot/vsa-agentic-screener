## 🚀 Ready for Entry
### ABVX (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
After a period of supply dominance in January, price has stabilized. The most recent weekly bar shows a narrow spread and the lowest volume in the sequence (RelVol 0.28), indicating that professional selling has dried up. This successful test suggests a move higher.

**Key Levels:** 110.98, 133.42

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 132.92
- **Invalidation:** 124.04
---
### ACWI (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Test in a Rising Market

**Smart Money Logic:**
Price is trending higher while volume is decreasing. The low volume on the last week (RelVol 0.62) while holding near highs suggests a lack of selling pressure. Professional money is comfortable holding positions.

**Key Levels:** 144.39, 148.41

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 147.73

### ADSK (BULLISH)

**Key Levels:** 215.01, 225.65

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 225.65
- **Invalidation:** 215.01
---
### AGIO (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Test of Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly sequence shows stopping volume followed by a successful low-volume test on the weekly. Volume has decreased as price moves up, but the high CLV (0.74 monthly) suggests accumulation.

**Key Levels:** 26.04, 31.02

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 31.02
- **Invalidation:** 29.13
---
### ALC (BULLISH)

- **Invalidation:** 28.84
---
### AMSC (BULLISH)

### ARE (BULLISH)

## 👀 Watch/Monitoring
### ACLX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result

**Smart Money Logic:**
Massive volume spike (RelVol 7.85) on the most recent weekly bar failed to move the price significantly (Spread 0.59), closing mid-range with a negative CLV. This indicates a transfer of bags from smart money to retail (distribution) at a peak.

**Key Levels:** 114.26, 113.66

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 113.66
- **Invalidation:** 114.27
---
### ACM (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** No Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
Large supply was seen on the Feb 9th week. The current week shows significantly lower volume (RelVol 0.48) as price drifts. This is a test of the supply bar, but without a strong bullish response, it remains vulnerable.

**Key Levels:** 87.56, 101.03

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close above 98.14
- **Invalidation:** 92.73
---
### ACWX (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
Similar to ACWI but with a weaker relative close. Volume is significantly lower (RelVol 0.49) on an up-week, indicating a lack of professional participation in the rally.

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 74.27
- **Invalidation:** 73.43
---
### ADP (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stock is under heavy distribution. Major supply bars on high volume (Feb 9) haven't been challenged. Last week's lower volume close near the lows suggests that even low-level selling is pushing the price down.

**Key Levels:** 203.26, 214.20

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 203.26
- **Invalidation:** 214.20
---
### AEHR (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
Strong bullish spread on rising monthly volume with a very high CLV (0.91). While it's in a 'climax' stage, the close at the high indicates smart money is still aggressively absorbing any supply.

**Key Levels:** 33.19, 40.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Consolidation break at 40.00
- **Invalidation:** 33.19
---
### AEVA (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** No Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
Price is idling on extremely low relative volume (0.18). This indicates a complete lack of interest from institutional players. In a bearish trend, this often leads to a further drift down.

**Key Levels:** 11.18, 14.30

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Volume surge above 14.30
- **Invalidation:** 12.05
---
### AFRM (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The dominant bars are all high-volume down moves. Last week's low volume retracement failed to reclaim any significant levels, indicating that the path of least resistance remains down.

**Key Levels:** 46.56, 52.89

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 46.56
- **Invalidation:** 50.62
---
### AHR (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
Strong price action but volume is declining significantly (RelVol 0.38) as it reaches new highs. This is typical of an exhaustive run. Bullish for now but watch for an upthrust.

**Key Levels:** 51.69, 53.10

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Hold above 52.50
- **Invalidation:** 51.69
---
### AIQ (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
A very narrow spread week on low volume following a period of weakness. Professional money is not buying this dip, and the lack of spread suggests total apathy.

**Key Levels:** 48.27, 53.94

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Volume breakout above 50.15
- **Invalidation:** 48.34
---
### AJG (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
A massive supply bar occurred on Feb 9th. The subsequent low volume 'bounce' is merely a lack of aggressive selling rather than presence of buying. Expect further downside after this weak test.

**Key Levels:** 195.00, 221.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 209.43
- **Invalidation:** 218.34
---
### AKAM (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Churning/Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
Extreme volatility on high volume indicates massive profit-taking followed by tentative support. Last week saw an attempt to recover on lower volume. This is an unstable equilibrium.

**Key Levels:** 90.88, 113.50

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Clearance of 104.00
- **Invalidation:** 92.68
---
### ALAB (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
A devastating high-volume sell bar (Feb 9) has changed the market character. Last week's volume was non-existent (RelVol 0.22), showing that no professional money is stepping in to support the stock.

**Key Levels:** 117.41, 135.20

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 123.45
- **Invalidation:** 131.48

- **Invalidation:** 16.62
---
### AMKR (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Huge supply on the Feb 9 bar (RelVol 2.24). The minor bounce since has been on very low volume, indicating a lack of conviction from buyers. Likely to retest the Feb lows.

**Key Levels:** 42.14, 57.09

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 45.91
- **Invalidation:** 49.01
---
### AMTM (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Massive supply entering on the monthly close (CLV -0.77). Weekly volume is drying up as price moves lower, but without a wide-spread up-bar, the trend remains bearish.

**Key Levels:** 29.16, 38.11

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 29.16
- **Invalidation:** 30.84
---
### AMZN (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Huge distribution volume on the Feb 2 week (RelVol 1.88). The price is now struggling in a low-volume recovery attempt. This 'weak rally' is prone to failure.

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 203.11
- **Invalidation:** 210.36
---
### AMZU (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Tracking AMZN with high correlation. Massive volume on the down-move indicates smart money exiting. The current low-volume sideways move is a redistribution signature.

**Key Levels:** 24.54, 40.40

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 26.23
- **Invalidation:** 28.10
---
### AON (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
High volume on Feb 9 suggests a climax/stopping event. Last week's narrow spread on low volume is a sign that selling pressure has diminished. If price holds 313, a reversal is likely.

**Key Levels:** 304.59, 358.04

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 326.44
- **Invalidation:** 312.89
---
### APLS (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** No Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
Volume has dried up significantly over the last three weeks. While this prevents further selling, the lack of a strong demand response suggests a choppy sideways period ahead.

**Key Levels:** 19.26, 27.46

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Volume surge above 22.81
- **Invalidation:** 20.10
---
### APO (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**

**Key Levels:** 111.34, 152.67

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 111.34
- **Invalidation:** 118.24
---
### APP (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

- **Invalidation:** 404.00

- **Invalidation:** 18.96
---
### ARES (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Significant supply in Feb (RelVol 2.65). Price is making lower highs and lower lows. Last week's weak close (CLV 0.07) on lower volume indicates a lack of buying interest.

**Key Levels:** 112.69, 155.10

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 112.69
- **Invalidation:** 121.03
---

Strong bullish run but the most recent weekly volume is very low (RelVol 0.31). This lack of participation at new highs suggests a need for a pullback or a test of the 40.00 level.

- **Entry Trigger:** Successful test of 40.00
- **Invalidation:** 38.85

### ARWR (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 62.39
- **Invalidation:** 64.89
---
### AS (BEARISH)

- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 38.00
- **Invalidation:** 42.09
---
### ASML (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
Parabolic movement on the monthly. While the trend is strong, the narrowing spreads and lower volume on the last week (RelVol 0.38) suggest the move is becoming exhausted.

**Key Levels:** 1316.06, 1507.17

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 1507.17
- **Invalidation:** 1462.00
---
### ATO (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
Price is vertical. Volume is declining on the way up (RelVol 0.28 last week), which is often a warning sign. However, the closing strength remains high. Look for an upthrust soon.

**Key Levels:** 164.50, 182.69

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Hold above 181.00
- **Invalidation:** 180.19
---
### AVAV (NEUTRAL)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Huge volatility in January has subsided into a very low volume test (RelVol 0.25). Professional interest is currently absent as the market digests the recent big moves.

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Volume surge above 285.77
- **Invalidation:** 246.15
---
### AVDL (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result

**Smart Money Logic:**
Extreme volume surge last week (RelVol 3.07) on an incredibly tiny spread (0.14) with a negative CLV. This indicates a massive battle where selling pressure absorbed all buying effort.

**Key Levels:** 21.54, 21.76

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 21.62
- **Invalidation:** 21.76
---
### AXON (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Major distribution on high volume in late January. The recent low volume recovery (RelVol 0.53) has a high CLV, but it lacks the volume required to overcome previous institutional selling.

**Key Levels:** 396.41, 649.89

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 410.54
- **Invalidation:** 444.25
---

---
### BAH (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 73.93
- **Invalidation:** 76.96
---
### BANC (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Test of Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
Price is pulling back into the previous monthly range on very low volume (RelVol 0.33), suggesting this is a healthy retest of a breakout rather than a reversal.

**Key Levels:** 18.76, 21.61

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 20.13
- **Invalidation:** 18.76
---
### BBVA (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

- **Invalidation:** 23.99
---

- **Invalidation:** 22.23
---
### BEP (BEARISH)

- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 31.59
- **Invalidation:** 32.78
---
### BFAM (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
Significant selling climax on 2/09 (RelVol 2.40) followed by a narrow spread 'Test' bar. While support is being found, the quarterly context remains bearish, requiring a successful secondary test before entry.

- **Invalidation:** 63.68
---
### BHP (BEARISH)

- **Invalidation:** 80.19

- **Invalidation:** 11.25
---
### BKSY (BEARISH)

- **Invalidation:** 21.48
---
### BL (BEARISH)

- **Invalidation:** 70.49
---

- **Invalidation:** 23.31
---
### CADE (BEARISH)

- **Invalidation:** 96.47
---
### CBRE (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

- **Invalidation:** 150.06

### CUZ (BEARISH)

- **Invalidation:** 33.45
---

- **Invalidation:** 37.55
---
### FIGR (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
Price has been in a steep markdown phase. The most recent week shows a significantly narrow spread and very low relative volume (0.57), indicating a lack of selling pressure at these lows. However, without a demand response, this is merely a pause in a dominant bearish trend.

**Key Levels:** 30.39, 28.37, 38.45

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** High volume bullish reversal bar closing above 30.50
- **Invalidation:** 28.30
---
### FISV (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
Consistent decline on decreasing volume. Last week's extremely low relative volume (0.26) suggests that professional interest in selling has dried up, but the quarterly bearish context and monthly supply dominance suggest lower prices until a stopping volume event occurs.

**Key Levels:** 57.91, 61.43, 64.40

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Breakout above 61.50 on high volume
- **Invalidation:** 57.80
---
### FOXA (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stock is currently testing the lows of a sharp drop. The narrowing spread and low volume (RelVol 0.34) indicate no active supply, but the lack of CLV strength shows smart money is not yet aggressively buying the dip.

**Key Levels:** 55.09, 57.83, 64.11

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Spring or Shakeout followed by a close above 58.00
- **Invalidation:** 55.00
---
### FTV (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result

**Smart Money Logic:**
A massive volume spike occurred two weeks ago with a wide spread, but subsequent bars failed to follow through higher. The high relative volume (2.03) on the pullback suggests supply is still present despite the quarterly bullish trend.

**Key Levels:** 54.97, 62.41, 56.49

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Successful test of the 55.00 level on low volume
- **Invalidation:** 54.90
---
### GWRE (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
Severe markdown phase. While the volume is declining at the lows, indicating a potential bottom, the overall sequence remains under supply dominance. Smart money is not yet supporting the price aggressively.

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Stopping volume bar (Ultra high volume, narrow spread, down bar)
- **Invalidation:** 120.00
---
### HIMS (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
Ultra-high volume on the recent sell-off suggests a panic flush. Last week's volume remains high while the spread narrowed, showing absorption (Stopping Volume). However, the trend is too strong to call a reversal yet.

**Key Levels:** 13.74, 16.92, 21.12

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Daily close above the high of the stopping volume bar (16.06)
- **Invalidation:** 13.70
---
### HPE (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stock attempted a bounce which failed on declining volume. Last week's low RelVol (0.21) on a down-close bar suggests a lack of buying interest rather than a lack of supply. Smart money is staying away.

**Key Levels:** 19.84, 21.37, 24.37

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** New low on high volume or breakout above 22.00
- **Invalidation:** 21.50
---
### HPQ (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
Price is drifting lower on low volume. This is a weak market where neither buyers nor sellers are aggressive, but the prevailing monthly supply dominance keeps the verdict bearish.

**Key Levels:** 18.00, 19.37, 20.54

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Volume expansion on a down bar
- **Invalidation:** 19.50
---
### HRMY (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
A massive increase in volume (RelVol 2.35) on a wide spread down move suggests smart money absorption near 25-28. Last week confirmed this absorption with high volume and a recovery from the lows.

**Key Levels:** 25.90, 29.30, 38.20

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Successful test of 26.00 on low volume
- **Invalidation:** 25.80
---
### HSBC (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
After a high-volume sell-off bar, the price held and recovered on lower volume. This indicates that supply has been withdrawn. The quarterly bullish context supports an eventual move higher.

**Key Levels:** 83.93, 89.06, 90.80

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Breakout above 89.10
- **Invalidation:** 86.60
---
### IMAX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
Price is moving sideways to lower on very low volume. This lack of interest from big players during a market up-day (SPY move) indicates underlying weakness.

**Key Levels:** 34.59, 37.95, 39.13

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** High volume break below 34.50
- **Invalidation:** 37.00
---
### INVH (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
Consistent weak closes and a lack of demand. While volume is low, suggesting a lack of supply, there is zero professional effort to push the price higher in a bearish quarterly context.

**Key Levels:** 25.20, 25.75, 27.47

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** High volume rejection at 26.00
- **Invalidation:** 26.50

### IONQ (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
Following a monthly buying climax, the price is retracing. The volume is drying up on the attempt to move higher, showing a lack of professional demand (No Demand bar).

**Key Levels:** 29.98, 31.95, 36.56

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 30.00 on high volume
- **Invalidation:** 32.00
---
### IONX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stock is in a low-volume drift. RelVol 0.52 suggests sellers are exhausted, but without a significant demand bar (Effort), the stock will likely continue to sag.

**Key Levels:** 8.39, 9.39, 12.68

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** High volume reversal bar
- **Invalidation:** 8.30
---
### IQV (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
Despite the 'No Supply' look of the volume, the price is failing to react to market strength. The quarterly bearish context is the primary driver here.

**Key Levels:** 156.66, 166.43, 194.83

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** High volume breakdown below 160.00
- **Invalidation:** 171.13
---
### KKR (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
Bearish trend with declining volume. The 'No Supply' here is likely a result of buyers being absent, causing a lack of liquidity rather than a bullish setup.

**Key Levels:** 91.05, 99.90, 116.08

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** High volume break below 91.00
- **Invalidation:** 100.00
---
### KLAR (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
Extreme high volume (RelVol 4.94) at the recent lows followed by a low volume bounce. While there is absorption, the sheer amount of supply indicates a long basing process is needed.

**Key Levels:** 12.50, 14.03, 20.08

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Test of 12.50 on low volume
- **Invalidation:** 12.00
---
### KVYO (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
Bounce off lows on low relative volume. The lack of effort from buyers suggests this is a 'dead cat bounce' within a supply-dominant environment.

**Key Levels:** 15.52, 17.52, 22.09

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** New daily lows
- **Invalidation:** 18.22
---
### LSCC (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
A massive surge in volume (RelVol 2.01) accompanied by a very wide spread, but the price closed well off the highs. This suggests significant supply was introduced (Selling into Strength).

**Key Levels:** 84.76, 97.62, 108.08

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close above 108.00 on ultra high volume
- **Invalidation:** 92.00
---
### MAN (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
Price is falling towards the low of the range on low volume. Without a high-volume stopping action, the price will likely continue to drift lower.

**Key Levels:** 25.64, 28.37, 36.40

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Volume spike at the 25.00 support
- **Invalidation:** 28.60
---
### MAT (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
Massive supply bar (RelVol 4.07) followed by narrow spread low volume action. The professionals have halted the fall for now, but the trend remains heavily bearish.

**Key Levels:** 14.75, 17.55, 22.47

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 18.25
- **Invalidation:** 16.40
---
### MNDY (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
Huge volume on the sell-off followed by signs of professional absorption at lower levels. However, the high volume of supply encountered suggests a long period of re-accumulation is needed.

**Key Levels:** 68.68, 76.41, 92.73

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Test of the 70.00 area on low volume
- **Invalidation:** 68.60
---
### MSFU (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
The price is bleeding lower with no support from smart money. Low volume here represents a 'No Demand' environment rather than a bullish reversal setup.

**Key Levels:** 24.97, 26.81, 30.79

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Aggressive volume increase on a bullish bar
- **Invalidation:** 27.00
---
### MTCH (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
Price is flat on low volume. In VSA terms, if the price cannot rise when supply is low, it indicates a lack of professional interest.

**Key Levels:** 28.80, 31.88, 33.40

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close below 30.50
- **Invalidation:** 31.90
---
### NET (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
High volume at the lows with narrowing spreads. Smart money is clearly active here, but the lack of follow-through and high volatility makes this a high-risk area.

**Key Levels:** 158.83, 176.73, 203.61

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Stable basing above 165.00 on low volume
- **Invalidation:** 158.00
---
### OMF (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stock is sliding into support on low volume. While supply is drying up, the heavy bearish trend suggests waiting for a high-volume stopping bar before considering a bottom.

**Key Levels:** 53.59, 56.91, 62.26

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Climactic volume spike at support
- **Invalidation:** 53.50
---
### PAGP (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
Price is rising but volume is contracting significantly (RelVol 0.31). While the trend is bullish, the lack of volume at the highs suggests a pause or minor pullback is likely before further gains.

**Key Levels:** 21.87, 22.43, 20.12

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** New high on expanded volume
- **Invalidation:** 21.50
---
### PGY (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
Price is drifting lower with very little professional activity. Low volume in this context is indicative of a lack of buyers rather than a bottoming signal.

**Key Levels:** 10.51, 11.69, 12.72

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Daily reversal candle on high volume
- **Invalidation:** 10.50
---
### PRU (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Heavy selling volume on Feb 02 (RelVol 2.41) was not met with demand. Recent bars show negative CLV and declining volume, suggesting price is falling due to lack of interest rather than absorption.

**Key Levels:** 98.80, 104.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 98.80
- **Invalidation:** 104.00
---
### PSN (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result

**Smart Money Logic:**
High volume on Feb 09 (RelVol 1.74) resulted in a wide down-bar that the subsequent two weeks of low volume could not recover. Monthly context shows supply dominance.

**Key Levels:** 59.13, 67.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break of 63.90
- **Invalidation:** 67.00
---
### QQQI (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for wide spread expansion
- **Invalidation:** 51.11
---
### QTWO (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Aggressive selling on high volume throughout February. Low volume on the latest bar with a low close (CLV -0.79) indicates the path of least resistance remains down.

**Key Levels:** 46.92, 50.55

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 46.92
- **Invalidation:** 50.55
---
### RARE (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Test of Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
After heavy selling in early Feb, price attempted a recovery. The latest bar shows a very low volume 'Test' (RelVol 0.35). If demand returns, this is a bottom.

**Key Levels:** 19.60, 23.79

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 23.79
- **Invalidation:** 22.38
---
### RF (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
Price is rolling over on declining volume. The most recent week shows a negative CLV (-0.82) on very low volume, indicating that buyers are absent at these levels.

**Key Levels:** 28.28, 31.53

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break of 28.28
- **Invalidation:** 30.16
---
### RKT (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
High volume on the drop in late January suggests stopping volume, but the recovery is weak with low CLV and low relative volume. Needs to prove demand.

**Key Levels:** 16.58, 18.89

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 18.04
- **Invalidation:** 16.58
---
### RLI (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
Strong monthly trend, but weekly volume is dropping significantly (RelVol 0.39) on the highs. This is a 'No Demand' bar in an uptrend, suggesting a pullback is likely.

**Key Levels:** 58.15, 63.61

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Pullback to 59.00 and test
- **Invalidation:** 58.15
---
### RTO (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Upthrust After Climax

- **Invalidation:** 31.60
---
### RYN (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 21.29
- **Invalidation:** 22.65
---
### SATS (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
Massive volume at the highs in Jan/Feb with subsequent price failure and negative CLVs suggests smart money distribution into retail demand.

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 104.77
- **Invalidation:** 110.23
---
### SONY (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break of 21.18
- **Invalidation:** 21.95
---
### SPOT (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for breakout of 454-490 range
- **Invalidation:** 454.01
---
### SSNC (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**

- **Invalidation:** 71.22
---

- **Invalidation:** 73.25
