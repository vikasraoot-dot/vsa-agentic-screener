## 🚀 Ready for Entry
### AMH (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Confirmed Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
The high volume down bar on 01/05 (RelVol 2.53) closed off its lows (CLV 0.14), marking Stopping Volume/Absorption. This was followed immediately by a strong bullish bar on 01/12 (RelVol 1.55, CLV 0.91), confirming aggressive demand follow-through. Strong bullish reversal structure in a bullish quarterly context.

**Key Levels:** $32.65 (Resistance), $30.51 (SV Low Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $32.45 (01/12 high) on volume.
- **Invalidation:** $30.51 (Violation of accumulation low)
---
### AXTA (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Demand Continuation / Low Resistance Climb

**Smart Money Logic:**
Demand is strong, confirmed by the 01/12 bar which saw high volume (1.35) and closed near the high (CLV 0.90), showing effort matching result. This bullish structure suggests the accumulation phase signaled by the Monthly SV is successfully leading to continuation.

**Key Levels:** $33.63 (Recent High), $32.80 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $33.63 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** $32.79 (Loss of recent momentum)
---
### BRBR (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Accumulation Phase

**Smart Money Logic:**
The sharp down bar on 12/29 (CLV -0.99) likely marked a Selling Climax/Shakeout. This was followed by high volume bars closing higher (01/05, 01/12, 01/19 bounce). This structure suggests accumulation is taking place, overriding the bearish quarterly trend and Monthly SD signal.

**Key Levels:** $21.67 (Accumulation Low), $26.79 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $26.79 on confirmation volume.
- **Invalidation:** $21.67 (Violation of accumulation low)
---
### CALM (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax / Automatic Rally

**Smart Money Logic:**
The 01/05 bar marked a massive Selling Climax (RelVol 2.25, wide spread, CLV -0.77). This panic selling was immediately reversed by the 01/12 bar (RelVol 1.76), which closed on its high (CLV 0.98), confirming a strong Automatic Rally and professional accumulation starting, likely signaling a reversal of the bearish quarterly trend.

**Key Levels:** $77.99 (Immediate Resistance), $71.92 (Accumulation Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $77.99 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** $71.92 (Violation of accumulation low)
---
### CPNG (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
W4 showed extreme high volume (RelVol 2.07) on a wide spread down, closing poorly, confirming institutional distribution and selling pressure, aligning with the bearish trend. Demand is weak.

**Key Levels:** 23.37 (Resistance), 20.72 (Recent Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close below 20.70 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 22.87
---
### CTRA (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Effort No Result Down

**Smart Money Logic:**
W3 confirmed a Buying Climax. W4 saw extreme volume, but the price closed poorly (-0.45 CLV) despite touching the high, indicating supply dominating the effort and trapping buyers. Bearish momentum is strong.

**Key Levels:** 28.48 (Climax High/Resistance), 24.68 (W4 Low/Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close below 24.68 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 26.70
---
### DUOL (BEARISH)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close below 147.70 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 153.28
---
### FFIV (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Distribution

**Smart Money Logic:**
W4 is a classic high-volume distribution bar (RelVol 1.22, wide spread, poor close) at recent highs, signaling Smart Money exiting. The bullish quarterly context is severely compromised by this supply injection.

**Key Levels:** 280.75 (Distribution Peak/Resistance), 254.21 (W4 Low/Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close below 254.20 on high volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 280.75
---
### FISV (BEARISH)

**Key Levels:** 69.53 (Resistance), 64.18 (Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close below 64.18 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 69.53
---
### FRPT (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Strong Demand/Breakout Attempt

**Smart Money Logic:**
Strong demand bars in W3 and W4, characterized by high CLV and increasing volume, confirm a bullish commitment. W5 continues this strength, pushing towards new highs. The monthly Stopping Volume context suggests a healthy market reversing earlier supply.

**Key Levels:** 68.21 (Recent High/Target), 64.00 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close above 68.21 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 64.00
---
### GWRE (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax / Extreme Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
W4 was an extreme Selling Climax (RelVol 1.94, massive spread down, low CLV), confirming heavy capitulation. The subsequent weak close in W5 suggests the price is hovering near the low, indicating demand is not yet strong enough to initiate a sustained rebound.

**Key Levels:** 185.07 (Resistance), 158.80 (SC Low/Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close below 158.80 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 185.07
---
### HDB (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance followed by weak test

**Smart Money Logic:**
W3 was a clear Supply Dominance bar (RelVol 2.88, low CLV). W4's test was immediately rejected, and W5 shows persistent weakness. The bearish quarterly trend is firmly intact, driven by institutional selling.

**Key Levels:** 33.59 (W4 High/Resistance), 31.98 (W5 Low/Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close below 31.95 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 33.59
---
### HPE (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close below 20.07 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 22.71
---
### IMAX (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Strong Demand/Absorption

**Smart Money Logic:**
The decline in W3 was immediately absorbed by strong buying in W4 (high volume, high CLV), confirmed by the high close in W5. This successful absorption (Stopping Volume Test) suggests demand is preparing for upward continuation.

**Key Levels:** 37.80 (W5 High/Resistance), 33.62 (W4 Low/Strong Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close above 37.80 on volume, confirming breakout.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 33.60
---
### IOT (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
W3 and W5 confirm strong supply dominance (high volume, poor closes). The attempted demand rally in W4 was quickly overwhelmed, suggesting aggressive distribution continuing the bearish quarterly trend.

**Key Levels:** 35.87 (W4 High/Resistance), 31.91 (W5 Low/Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close below 31.90 on increasing volume.

---
### JPM (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Confirmed Distribution)

---
### KVYO (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax (Failed Stopping Volume)

W3 attempted accumulation (Stopping Volume), but W4 was a massive follow-through failure (Selling Climax), confirming overwhelming supply (RelVol 1.02, extreme low close). The path of least resistance is down.

**Key Levels:** 28.65 (W4 High/Resistance), 23.74 (W4 Low/Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close below 23.70 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 28.65
---
### KYMR (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Confirmed Weakness (Supply returns)

**Smart Money Logic:**
W4 confirmed that demand absorption (W3) failed, as aggressive supply returned (low volume down, extreme low CLV). This strong bearish action aligns with the distribution suggested by the monthly Buying Climax.

**Key Levels:** 77.92 (W3 High/Resistance), 69.08 (W3 Low/Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close below 69.00 on increasing volume.

---
### LHX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result Up (Major Distribution)

**Smart Money Logic:**

**Key Levels:** 361.59 (Distribution Peak/Resistance), 332.88 (W4 Low/Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close below 332.88 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 361.59
---
### MSFU (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close below 35.50 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 40.85
---
### NFXL (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Consistent high volume selling (W2, W3, W4) with low CLVs confirms aggressive institutional distribution and weakness. The bearish quarterly trend is strongly reinforced.

High volume spike on 01/05 followed by a failure to hold gains and high volume sell-off on 01/12 suggests a massive distribution event or blow-off top around $24. The Monthly CLV of 0.09 reinforces strong supply overhead, confirming the reversal potential.

**Key Levels:** 24.36 (Distribution High), 22.40 (Initial Support Break), 19.80 (Re-accumulation zone)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 22.00 or Test of 23.00 on low volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 24.50
---
### RTO (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Confirmed Re-accumulation)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The volume surge on 01/12 (1.91 RelVol) with a moderate spread and a mid-range close signaled significant absorption of supply (Stopping Volume). This is a strong indication of Smart Money accumulating before a further markup phase in the Bullish Quarterly Trend.

**Key Levels:** 30.60 (Stopping Volume Low/Support), 32.20 (Recent High/Initial Target), 31.70 (Breakout Point)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 31.70 on increasing volume, confirming absorption.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 30.50
---
### SA (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Successful Test/Breakout

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly candle finished near the high (CLV 0.94), invalidating prior supply concerns. Weekly action saw selling pressure (01/12) quickly absorbed, followed by a strong close on 01/19. This suggests Smart Money is supporting the markup phase and breaking out above $32.

**Key Levels:** 33.15 (Recent High/Target), 31.76 (Support after breakout), 30.04 (Key Accumulation Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 33.20 or entry on a low volume pullback to 32.00.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 30.80
---
### TFX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
Relentless selling confirmed by consecutive wide spreads, high volume, and extremely poor CLVs (01/12 CLV -0.93). The monthly bar also closed at its absolute low. The subsequent narrow bar shows no demand entering the market, pointing toward markdown acceleration below $100.

**Key Levels:** 108.38 (Immediate Resistance), 100.20 (Current Low), 95.00 (Projected Downside Target)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 100.00 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 104.00
---
### TRU (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result Down / Failed Rally

**Smart Money Logic:**
The rally following the prior monthly stopping volume failed to maintain momentum, finding strong supply near $89. The recent weak closing bar (01/19 CLV -0.68) confirms that supply has reasserted control, suggesting a distribution phase or failed accumulation structure.

**Key Levels:** 89.12 (Supply Zone/Resistance), 81.08 (Primary Support), 86.00 (Failure Level)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 81.50 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 87.00
---
### USIG (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / High Volume Upthrust

**Smart Money Logic:**
The extreme volume spike (2.36 RelVol) on 01/12 occurred within a tight range near the highs, but resulted in a neutral/weak close. Given the bearish quarterly trend and severely weak monthly close, this is interpreted as significant distribution or rejection of higher prices by Smart Money.

**Key Levels:** 52.12 (High Resistance), 51.80 (Mid-range resistance), 51.61 (Key Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 51.60 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 52.15
---
### WRB (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Selling Persistence / Weak Rally

**Smart Money Logic:**
Consecutive weeks of strong supply pressure (01/05, 01/12) confirmed the Supply Dominance context. The recent bar (01/19) is a narrow, low-volume bounce, interpreted as 'No Demand.' This setup strongly favors a continuation of the markdown in line with the Quarterly Bearish trend.

**Key Levels:** 66.65 (Support Low), 68.31 (Immediate Resistance), 69.77 (Previous High Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 66.50 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 68.50
---
## 👀 Watch/Monitoring
### ACLX (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Strong Demand Continuation/Test Watch

**Smart Money Logic:**
Despite the monthly Supply Dominance warning, the weekly bars 01/05 (High Volume, CLV 0.83) and 01/12 (Moderate Volume, CLV 0.65) show strong consecutive demand bars, pushing the price higher. This indicates potential absorption of earlier supply and continuation of the bullish quarterly trend.

**Key Levels:** $70.11 (Recent High), $63.33 (Recent Low Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $76.50 (01/19 high) on volume.
- **Invalidation:** $63.33 (Loss of recent strong support)
---
### ACN (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result Down (Weakness)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly Stopping Volume (SV) suggests accumulation underway. The weekly bar 01/12 saw high volume (1.19) but failed to hold gains, suggesting supply entering the market near $291. The subsequent 01/19 pullback closes very weak (CLV -0.93). This looks like a deep test of demand after the rally.

**Key Levels:** $258.00 (SV Low), $291.09 (Recent High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Bullish reversal candle from $273-$275 zone on low volume (No Supply Test).
- **Invalidation:** $258.00 (Violation of SV low)
---
### AEO (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result Up (Supply)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly Buying Climax suggests maturity of the trend. The bar 01/12 saw high relative volume (0.77) but closed flat (CLV -0.02), indicating selling pressure absorbed the demand effort near the highs. Price is consolidating below the $28 high, indicating a pause or early distribution.

**Key Levels:** $28.33 (Resistance), $23.88 (Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $28.33 on high volume.
- **Invalidation:** $23.88 (Violation of 01/12 low)
---
### AGIO (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Test of Stopping Volume Low

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly Stopping Volume suggests accumulation. However, the subsequent rally attempt (01/05) was quickly rejected by selling pressure, leading to a down bar on 01/12 closing very low (CLV -0.91). This is a test of the recent demand area ($27.11). Failure to hold this level suggests renewed bearish continuation, but current stabilization is neutral.

**Key Levels:** $27.11 (Test Support), $24.16 (Prior SV Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Low volume reversal/spring from $26.50 area.
- **Invalidation:** $24.16 (Violation of SV low)
---
### AIQ (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result Up / Weakness

**Smart Money Logic:**
The rally on 01/05 met supply on 01/12, where high volume (1.27) resulted in a middling close (CLV -0.29), signaling 'Effort No Result Up'. This followed the monthly Stopping Volume. The weak close on 01/19 suggests supply has the short-term edge and is testing demand after the failed high.

**Key Levels:** $53.25 (Resistance), $50.80 (Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Low volume test near $50.80 followed by bullish reversal.
- **Invalidation:** $50.80 (Violation of swing low)
---
### AL (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Tight Consolidation / Distribution Watch

**Smart Money Logic:**
Despite the confirmed monthly Buying Climax, price is moving in an extremely narrow, low-volume range near all-time highs ($64.00 - $64.40). This tight coiling suggests uncertainty or controlled distribution/accumulation. Given the BC context, distribution is the primary concern, but currently neutral movement.

**Key Levels:** $64.40 (Range High), $64.12 (Range Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $64.07 on volume for bearish setup.
- **Invalidation:** $64.40 (Breakout above coiling range)
---
### ALC (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Selling Pressure Returns

**Smart Money Logic:**
The initial bounce after the monthly Stopping Volume (SV) failed on 01/12, showing renewed selling pressure (CLV -0.41) on high volume (0.76). This indicates a successful Test of Supply/No Demand. Price is now hovering near the recent swing lows, testing accumulation support.

**Key Levels:** $77.88 (Recent Low Support), $81.65 (Failed Rally High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Low volume bounce off $78.00 support.
- **Invalidation:** $76.74 (Violation of SV low area)
---
### AMZU (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result Up / Supply Entry

**Smart Money Logic:**
The demand surge on 01/05 (CLV 0.95) was immediately rejected on 01/12. Despite moderate volume (0.76), the wide spread closed poorly (CLV -0.59), signaling 'Effort No Result Up' and failure to maintain the rally. This validates the Monthly Supply Dominance alert.

**Key Levels:** $40.40 (Failed Rally High), $34.15 (Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $34.15 on confirmation volume.
- **Invalidation:** $40.40 (Reversal invalidation)
---
### ARE (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Demand Continuation / Bullish Breakout

**Smart Money Logic:**
Following a monthly Stopping Volume signal, the weekly bars show aggressive demand. 01/05 (High Volume, CLV 0.90) and 01/12 (Moderate Volume, CLV 0.87) are strong up bars, confirming continuation and pushing price toward new highs, suggesting a successful accumulation phase has concluded.

**Key Levels:** $58.22 (Resistance), $53.15 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $58.22 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** $53.15 (Loss of breakout momentum/support)
---
### ARWR (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax / Potential Automatic Rally

**Smart Money Logic:**
Extreme volume on 01/05 and 01/12 resulted in massive supply (Weekly SD confirmation). This intense selling suggests a Selling Climax. The strong bounce on the incomplete 01/19 bar (CLV 0.98) acts as an Automatic Rally (AR). The stock is now in a volatile accumulation phase.

**Key Levels:** $60.62 (SC Low), $68.44 (AR High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a low volume test (Secondary Test - ST) near $60.62.
- **Invalidation:** Break below $60.62 (Renewed collapse)
---
### AS (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result Up / Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The rally attempt on 01/05 failed to gain traction, and supply returned on 01/12 (CLV -0.49). This failure confirms supply presence above $38, aligning with the BEARISH quarterly trend and Monthly SD signal. Price is challenging recent support.

**Key Levels:** $38.73 (Resistance), $35.87 (Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $35.87 on confirmation volume.
- **Invalidation:** $38.73 (Reversal invalidation)
---
### AZN (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result Up / Distribution

**Smart Money Logic:**
The rally attempt failed on 01/12 where extreme volume (3.31) resulted in a poor middle close (CLV -0.12), indicating strong supply overcame the buying effort at $96 (Effort No Result Up). This suggests the rally was absorbed and aligns with the BEARISH quarterly context.

**Key Levels:** $96.43 (Distribution Level), $89.17 (Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $89.17 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** $96.43 (Failure to confirm distribution)
---
### BANC (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax Follow-through / Weak Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
The confirmed Monthly BC suggests weakness, though demand continued on 01/12 (CLV 0.59). The small reversal on 01/19 (CLV -0.56) indicates a minor test of demand/supply re-entry. Given the proximity to the climax area, the stock is highly vulnerable to distribution.

**Key Levels:** $21.09 (BC Resistance), $19.68 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $19.68 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** $21.09 (Continuation above resistance)
---
### BBIO (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result Up / Supply Absorption

**Smart Money Logic:**
The extreme volume bar on 01/12 (RelVol 2.03) had a wide spread but closed poorly (CLV 0.19), signaling supply absorption or distribution near $80 resistance. Despite the weekly SV context suggesting bullish bias, this immediate supply suggests the area needs careful monitoring for potential reversal.

**Key Levels:** $79.88 (Resistance), $70.95 (SV Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $79.88 on volume OR low volume test near $75.00.
- **Invalidation:** $70.95 (Violation of SV low)
---
### BEP (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Failed Rally

**Smart Money Logic:**
The price remains challenged by the confirmed Monthly Supply Dominance. Although demand appeared on 01/12 (CLV 0.40), the low CLV on the subsequent 01/19 action suggests the rally is meeting renewed supply. The long-term bearish context prevails over short-term demand.

**Key Levels:** $28.76 (Resistance), $26.71 (Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $26.71 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** $28.76 (Failure to break down)
---
### BFH (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Shakeout / Demand Failure

**Smart Money Logic:**
The 01/12 bar (Extreme Volume 2.27, CLV 0.86) was a textbook bullish shakeout/SV confirmation. However, the immediate rejection on 01/19 (CLV -0.88) signals that the demand failed swiftly, suggesting significant supply entered the market at the high, creating a high-volatility trap.

**Key Levels:** $74.17 (Shakeout High), $67.80 (Shakeout Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Confirmation of supply below $69.70.
- **Invalidation:** $74.17 (Re-entry above high supply zone)
---
### BHF (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Tight Consolidation / No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
Trading in an exceptionally tight range on low volume (around $64.00 - $64.70). This stability following a Monthly Buying Climax suggests distribution is subtle or professional interest is absent. The lack of upward momentum confirms resistance.

**Key Levels:** $64.69 (Resistance), $63.80 (Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $63.80 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** $65.36 (Breakout above monthly high)
---
### BKSY (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Churning at Highs

**Smart Money Logic:**
The confirmed Monthly BC means distribution is expected. The high volume on 01/12 resulted in a soft close (CLV 0.19), suggesting supply absorption. Price is now churning near the high ($29.79), indicating a battle between remaining demand and entering supply.

**Key Levels:** $29.79 (Resistance), $24.24 (Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $25.46 (01/19 low) on volume.
- **Invalidation:** $29.79 (Breakout invalidation)
---
### BNS (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Supply Shock / Demand Battle

**Smart Money Logic:**
A massive supply bar appeared on 01/05 (RelVol 1.88, CLV -0.60), confirming the Weekly SD alert. However, demand immediately countered this with a strong up bar on 01/12 (RelVol 1.27, CLV 0.71). This is a major battleground. Given the Bullish Quarterly trend, demand is resilient, but the supply shock was severe.

**Key Levels:** $74.97 (Resistance), $71.63 (Supply Low Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $74.97 on volume to confirm absorption.
- **Invalidation:** $71.63 (Break below supply low)
---
### BP (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Failed Rally

**Smart Money Logic:**
The short rally into 01/05 was met by supply (RelVol 1.86, CLV -0.37), confirming the Weekly SD. The subsequent 01/12 rally attempt saw high volume (1.38) but a mediocre close (CLV 0.18), indicating 'Effort No Result Up'. Supply remains dominant in this bearish context.

**Key Levels:** $36.29 (Resistance), $34.06 (Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $34.06 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** $36.29 (Reversal invalidation)
---
### BRKR (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Shakeout/Test of Supply Successful

**Smart Money Logic:**
The powerful up move on 01/05 was followed by a severe downside reversal on 01/12 (High Volume 1.07, CLV -0.87). This large move down followed by an immediate bounce (01/19) suggests a Shakeout of weak holders at the high end of the trading range, confirming demand resilience in the bullish context (Monthly SV).

**Key Levels:** $56.22 (Shakeout High), $47.84 (Shakeout Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Confirmation of strength above $50.65.
- **Invalidation:** $47.84 (Violation of demand area)
---
### BSY (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result Up / Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The rally attempt on 01/05 met supply on 01/12, where high volume (1.03) resulted in a weak close (CLV -0.58). This is 'Effort No Result Up,' confirming supply dominance, aligning with the BEARISH quarterly context and Monthly SD warning. Price is failing below $40.

**Key Levels:** $40.66 (Resistance), $37.70 (Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $37.70 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** $40.66 (Reversal invalidation)
---
### BXSL (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Low Volume Consolidation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The confirmed Monthly SD keeps the bias bearish. Price is consolidating tightly around $26 on moderate volume. While 01/12 showed a positive close (CLV 0.74), the immediate lack of follow-through and tight range indicate lack of demand to overcome the underlying supply pressure.

**Key Levels:** $26.71 (Resistance), $25.90 (Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $25.90 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** $26.71 (Clearance of distribution area)
---
### CADE (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Demand Continuation / Commitment

**Smart Money Logic:**
Despite the Monthly Buying Climax warning, demand is aggressive. The 01/12 bar saw high volume (1.20) resulting in a strong close (CLV 0.65). Strong effort yields strong result, indicating professional commitment and likely pushing into new highs.

**Key Levels:** $46.02 (Resistance), $42.78 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $46.02 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** $42.78 (Loss of recent demand support)
---
### CAI (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result Up / Supply Battle

**Smart Money Logic:**
Extreme volume (2.06) on 01/12 resulted in a poor middle close (CLV -0.03), indicating a massive supply/demand battle where supply temporarily held the rally back. This follows a strong demand bar (01/05) and suggests intense churning and possible accumulation failure, despite the Weekly SV signal.

**Key Levels:** $29.32 (Resistance), $24.69 (SV Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $29.32 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** $24.69 (Violation of swing low)
---
### CNXC (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume followed by Weak Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
Very high volume (W4) on a wide spread up, closing strong after touching the low (37.84), indicates aggressive demand absorption/Stopping Volume. The subsequent week shows supply attempting to test the rally, but the low should hold.

**Key Levels:** 44.78 (Resistance), 37.85 (Stopping Volume Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close above 43.15 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 37.80
---
### CORT (CAUTIOUS BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax followed by Weak Test of Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
W2 was an extreme Selling Climax (RelVol 5.58, huge spread down), indicating panic selling absorbed near 32.99. Subsequent weeks (W4/W5) test this low. W5 suggests momentary lack of supply, setting up for a potential reversal attempt despite the bearish quarterly context.

**Key Levels:** 38.20 (Initial Resistance), 32.99 (Selling Climax Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close above 38.20 on high volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 32.90
---
### CRBG (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result Up

**Smart Money Logic:**
High volume in W4 failed to produce a strong close, indicating supply aggressively met the demand. The weak close in W5 confirms persistent supply pressure and aligns with the monthly Buying Climax warning (distribution).

**Key Levels:** 31.50 (Resistance), 29.36 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close below 29.30 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 31.50
---
### CSGP (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax followed by Strong Demand Response

**Smart Money Logic:**
W3 was a clear capitulation bar (SC) on extreme volume. W4 immediately reacted with massive volume and a strong close, indicating aggressive demand absorption by Smart Money. Price is currently consolidating near the high of the absorption bar.

**Key Levels:** 65.93 (Immediate Resistance), 58.41 (SC Low/Primary Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close above 65.93 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 58.40
---
### DOW (CAUTIOUS NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result Up (Distribution)

**Smart Money Logic:**
W4 showed high volume and a wide spread up, but the poor close (CLV 0.22) signals supply entered aggressively near 28.52 (Distribution). This aligns with the monthly Supply Dominance status. Bullish momentum has stalled.

**Key Levels:** 28.52 (Distribution High/Resistance), 26.07 (W4 Low/Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close below 26.00 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 28.52
---
### ENR (CAUTIOUS NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Reversal Bar / Supply Appears

**Smart Money Logic:**
W4 formed a reversal bar on high volume, where strong demand from W3 was rejected, resulting in a low close. This indicates Smart Money is taking profits/injecting supply near the highs (21.89).

**Key Levels:** 21.89 (Resistance), 20.47 (Support/W4 Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Breakdown below 20.47 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 21.89
---
### FER (CAUTIOUS NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Immediate Weakness following demand effort

**Smart Money Logic:**
W4 showed good demand, but W5 immediately reversed the action with a very weak close near the low, suggesting the overhead supply (monthly Supply Dominance) is active and aggressive, stalling the bullish effort.

**Key Levels:** 68.54 (Resistance), 66.32 (Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close above 68.54 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 66.32
---
### FIBK (CAUTIOUS NEUTRAL)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close below 35.97 on heavy volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 37.56
---
### GBCI (CAUTIOUS NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result Up

**Key Levels:** 48.89 (Resistance), 45.94 (Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close above 48.90 on high volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 45.90
---
### GKOS (CAUTIOUS BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Strong Momentum

**Smart Money Logic:**
W4 shows exceptional demand and momentum (RelVol 1.25, massive spread up, high CLV). Although this is a classic Buying Climax signal suggesting exhaustion, the immediate follow-through strength in W5 necessitates a bullish short-term view until supply is confirmed.

**Key Levels:** 124.44 (W5 High/Resistance), 118.50 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Continuation move above 124.44 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 118.50
---
### GNTX (CAUTIOUS NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result Up

**Smart Money Logic:**
W4 saw high volume (RelVol 1.21) on a wide spread, but closed near the low (CLV -0.01), signaling institutional supply injection. This confirms the pressure from the monthly Supply Dominance status, stalling the bullish trend.

**Key Levels:** 24.53 (W4 High/Resistance), 23.35 (W4 Low/Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close below 23.35 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 24.53
---
### HRMY (CAUTIOUS NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Reversal Bar/Supply Injection

**Smart Money Logic:**
Strong demand in W3 was immediately negated by high volume selling in W4 (Reversal Bar), closing poorly. This signals aggressive distribution by Smart Money, aligning with the monthly Supply Dominance warning.

**Key Levels:** 39.40 (W4 High/Resistance), 34.68 (W4 Low/Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short below 34.68 on volume confirmation.

---
### INVH (CAUTIOUS BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume followed by Strong Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
W3 was a major Selling Climax/Stopping Volume event (extreme volume, low 25.29). W4 provided immediate strong demand confirmation (high CLV, high volume follow-through). Accumulation is likely occurring despite the bearish quarterly trend.

**Key Levels:** 27.65 (W4 Close/Immediate Resistance), 25.29 (SC Low/Primary Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close above 27.65 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 25.29

### IONQ (CAUTIOUS NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result Up / Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
Demand efforts (W3, W4) failed to achieve decisive high closes, indicating persistent supply overhead (W3 CLV -0.03). W5 weakness confirms institutional selling is active, aligning with the monthly Buying Climax flag.

**Key Levels:** 54.24 (W5 High/Resistance), 45.76 (W1 Low/Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close above 54.24 or close below 45.76 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 45.76
---
### IREN (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result Up (Distribution at high)

**Smart Money Logic:**
W4 showed a strong breakout, but the immediate, severe reversal in W5 (wide spread down, low CLV) indicates heavy supply entered the market at the peak (58.75), neutralizing the bullish momentum. Volatility suggests distribution is occurring.

**Key Levels:** 58.75 (Distribution Peak/Resistance), 53.33 (W5 Low/Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close below 53.33 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 58.75
---
### ITT (CAUTIOUS NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Demand Test Failure

**Smart Money Logic:**
W3 showed strong absorption effort, but subsequent weeks (W4/W5) failed to follow through, indicating persistent supply overhead (monthly Supply Dominance). Price is constrained in a range, leaning bearish due to the quarterly context.

**Key Levels:** 185.00 (W4 High/Resistance), 178.48 (W5 Low/Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close below 178.48 on volume.
