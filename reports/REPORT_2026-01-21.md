## 🚀 Ready for Entry
### AEO (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply (NS)

**Smart Money Logic:**
After encountering resistance and a shakeout attempt (01-12 high volume churn), the 01-19 bar shows extremely low volume on a narrow up bar. This confirms minimal supply remaining and sets up for a tactical long despite the Monthly Buying Climax context.

**Key Levels:** 27.07 (Resistance), 24.70 (NS Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 25.70 on confirming volume.
- **Invalidation:** 24.70
---
### AEVA (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Weak Bounce/Test of Supply after confirmed SD

**Smart Money Logic:**
Massive institutional supply hit the market on 01-12, following a blow-off top. The subsequent low volume rally on 01-19 is weak and fails to overcome resistance, suggesting supply is dominant and markdown will continue.

**Key Levels:** 22.62 (Supply Resistance), 18.32 (Recent Low Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break decisively below 18.32 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** 22.62
---
### AGIO (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Low Volume Test (LVT) / No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly context signals Stopping Volume. The latest weekly action shows a sharp pullback (01-12 shakeout) followed by an extremely narrow, low volume bar (01-19). This confirms the clearance of supply and prepares the base for accumulation breakout.

**Key Levels:** 29.44 (Resistance), 26.25 (Support/Test zone)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 27.08 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** 26.25
---
### ALC (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Low Volume Test (LVT) / No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly SV context suggests accumulation. Weekly action shows persistent supply attempts being met around $79, followed by a low volume test (01-19). This absence of supply confirms preparation for a mark-up phase.

**Key Levels:** 80.75 (Recent Resistance), 78.26 (Support/Test Level)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 79.80 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** 78.26
---
### ALL (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (SD) / Weak Bounce

**Smart Money Logic:**
The 01-12 bar was a definitive high-volume reversal, confirming massive institutional distribution near $210. The 01-19 bar is a low-volume, poor-closing bounce, confirming lack of demand defense and susceptibility to further markdown.

**Key Levels:** 210.73 (Supply Resistance), 191.80 (SC Low/Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below 191.50 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** 196.04
---
### AMH (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply (NS) / Resting Phase

**Smart Money Logic:**
Confirmed accumulation structure: Stopping Volume (01-05), strong follow-through (01-12), followed by a healthy, low-volume pullback (01-19). Supply is exhausted and the path of least resistance is up.

**Key Levels:** 32.45 (Resistance/Recent High), 31.51 (NS Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 32.21 on confirming volume.
- **Invalidation:** 31.51
---
### ARE (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply (NS) / Continuation Setup

**Smart Money Logic:**
Two weeks of strong institutional demand led to a low volume consolidation/test (01-19). This NS signal confirms the absorption of supply and predicts an immediate bullish continuation.

**Key Levels:** 58.22 (Recent High), 56.01 (NS Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 57.71 on confirming volume.
- **Invalidation:** 56.01
---
### ARES (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Weakness Confirmed / Effort No Result Down (ENR-D)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Monthly BC and weekly supply rejection (01-12) confirmed distribution. The latest wide-spread drop closed on its low, confirming strong bearish intent despite low volume (lack of demand defense).

**Key Levels:** 177.63 (Supply Resistance), 163.05 (Recent Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below 163.05 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** 170.22
---
### AS (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Demand / Confirmed Weakness

**Smart Money Logic:**
Bearish quarterly and monthly context. The latest action shows repeated failures to rally, followed by a low volume drift down, closing poorly. This suggests minimal supply is needed to push the price lower, confirming weakness.

**Key Levels:** 37.21 (Resistance), 35.86 (Recent Low Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 35.86 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** 37.21
---
### AVAV (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Selling Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
Classic top formation confirmed by a Buying Climax (01-05) followed by a definitive high-volume, wide-spread reversal down (01-19). Institutional distribution is complete, and a markdown phase has begun.

**Key Levels:** 408.25 (BC High), 325.08 (Recent Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 325.08 on confirming volume.
- **Invalidation:** 370.00
---
### AXTA (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply (NS) / Continuation Setup

**Smart Money Logic:**
Strong demand (01-12) was followed by a healthy, low volume resting bar (01-19). This No Supply signal confirms supply absorption and sets up for a continuation of the bullish move, supporting the monthly Stopping Volume context.

**Key Levels:** 33.61 (Resistance/Recent High), 32.75 (NS Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 33.43 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** 32.75
---
### AXTI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Confirmed Weakness

**Smart Money Logic:**
Extreme blow-off top (01-05) followed by supply confirmation (01-12). The price continues to drift lower on above-average volume (relative to general weekly average), confirming sustained distribution and bearish control.

**Key Levels:** 26.66 (Supply Resistance), 20.68 (Recent Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 20.68 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** 22.69
---
### BABX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result (ENR) / No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
Rally met with supply absorption near $49 (ENR on 01-12). The latest bar is a low-volume down move closing poorly, confirming absent demand and setting up for markdown continuation, aligning with the bearish quarterly trend.

**Key Levels:** 49.31 (Supply Resistance), 42.82 (Recent Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 42.82 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** 45.20
---
### BANC (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Demand / Confirmed Weakness

**Smart Money Logic:**
Confirmed Monthly Buying Climax. The latest weekly bar is a low volume pullback that closes weakly, confirming that demand has vanished, exposing the stock to the projected markdown phase.

**Key Levels:** 21.09 (Resistance/BC High), 20.08 (Recent Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 20.08 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** 20.72
---
### BBT (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply (NS) / Consolidation

**Smart Money Logic:**
Despite a potential Monthly BC, the weekly charts show strong high closes followed by a low volume, narrow range consolidation. This lack of selling pressure (NS) suggests immediate upside is favored tactically.

**Key Levels:** 27.73 (Resistance), 27.00 (NS Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 27.73 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** 27.00
---
### BBWI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Demand / Confirmed Weakness

**Smart Money Logic:**
Monthly Supply Dominance confirmed. The rally (01-05) failed quickly, culminating in a low volume, wide spread down bar (01-19) closing near the low. Demand is clearly absent, making the price vulnerable.

**Key Levels:** 23.73 (Resistance), 21.58 (Recent Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 21.58 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** 22.68
---
### BEP (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Demand / Weakness Confirmed

**Smart Money Logic:**
Confirmed monthly SD. Weekly action shows persistent supply (01-05) and a subsequent rally that failed immediately on low volume (01-19). This confirms demand absence and vulnerability.

**Key Levels:** 28.76 (Resistance), 27.48 (Recent Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 27.48 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** 28.03
---
### BHF (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply (NS) / Consolidation

**Smart Money Logic:**
Price consolidating tightly around $64. The latest bar is a very low volume up bar closing near the high, a clear No Supply signal. This suggests short-term accumulation is complete, setting up for a tactical bullish move despite macro BC warning.

**Key Levels:** 65.36 (Resistance), 64.00 (NS Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 64.43 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** 64.00
---
### BKKT (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Selling Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
Extreme rally rejected by a massive supply bar (01-19 HSDC-L) that reversed the prior bullish momentum. This confirms institutional distribution and the bearish projection implied by the monthly SD.

**Key Levels:** 22.11 (Supply Resistance), 16.06 (Support/SC Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 16.06 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** 19.78
---
### BP (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Demand / Weakness

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stock has established resistance (01-05 supply) and continues to show weak bounces. The 01-19 bar is a low-volume drift down, closing poorly, suggesting Smart Money is allowing the price to fall, consistent with the bearish quarterly context.

**Key Levels:** 36.29 (Resistance), 34.06 (Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 35.02 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** 35.50
---
### BRBR (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply (NS) / Strong Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
Despite the bearish macro context (Quarterly/Monthly SD), the recent weeks show strong recovery (01-12) followed by a low volume continuation bar closing near the high (01-19). This signals a strong tactical accumulation and readiness for mark-up.

**Key Levels:** 26.79 (Recent High), 24.65 (NS Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 26.79 on confirming volume.
- **Invalidation:** 24.65
---
### BRKR (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Low Volume Test of Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
The massive supply bar on 01-12 functioned as a deep shakeout/SV in the context of bullish trends. The subsequent low volume up bar (01-19) confirms supply exhaustion and suggests accumulation continues, setting up for bullish follow-through.

**Key Levels:** 50.66 (Resistance), 46.82 (Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close above 50.66 on high volume.
- **Invalidation:** 46.82
---
### BXSL (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply/Resting

**Smart Money Logic:**
Despite the bearish trend, demand confirmed control on 01-12. The latest bar is a very narrow, very low volume bar, signaling supply is exhausted. Tactical long setup ready for continuation.

**Key Levels:** 26.71 (Resistance), 25.90 (NS Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 26.27 on confirming volume.
- **Invalidation:** 25.90
---
### CADE (BULLISH)

### CBRL (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Rejection / No Demand

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 32.55 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** 34.31
---
### CELC (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Rejection / No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
Supply entered forcefully on 01-12 (wide range down bar). The subsequent low volume consolidation closed weakly, confirming demand absence and vulnerability, aligning with the monthly SD context.

### CPNG (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The trend is BEARISH and both weekly and monthly sequences confirm SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The last two weekly candles show continued weakness on high volume (137M, 2.07 RelVol) followed by an attempt to rally, resulting in a very tight spread down bar closing near the low on low volume (0.48 RelVol, CLV -0.91). The institutional selling pressure is overwhelming, and lack of demand entry on the last weak rally attempt confirms Smart Money distribution/disinterest near $21.13.

**Key Levels:** $22.87 (Immediate Supply), $20.45 (Support/Recent Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $20.45 on increased volume.
- **Invalidation:** $22.87 (Above recent high/heavy supply zone)
---
### CTRA (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Potential Distribution)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence shows a clear BUYING_CLIMAX (87.3M volume, 2.07 RelVol, wide spread, poor close CLV -0.45) two weeks ago, indicating institutional selling into strength. The last weekly bar is a tight spread down bar, closing near the low (CLV -0.40) on low volume (0.50 RelVol). This suggests immediate follow-through selling pressure is low, but the prior climax event signals a high probability top in the near term. Quarterly trend is BEARISH, supporting the distribution narrative.

**Key Levels:** $28.48 (Climax High/Major Resistance), $26.00 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $26.00 with increased volume.
- **Invalidation:** $28.48 (Above climax high)
---
### DUOL (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance Continuation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly context is BEARISH, reinforced by the monthly SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The price crashed heavily two weeks ago on very high volume (14.2M, 1.6 RelVol), resulting in a wide spread down bar closing near the low (CLV -0.78), confirming massive selling/panic. The last week is a tight spread down bar, closing near the low (CLV -0.68) on low volume (0.46 RelVol). This absence of meaningful buying, combined with the extreme selling pressure, indicates institutional distribution is ongoing or pausing before a continuation downward.

**Key Levels:** $153.27 (Immediate Supply), $147.69 (Major Low/Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $147.69 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** $170.09 (Above recent reaction high)

The last weekly bar is a tight spread down bar, closing near the low (CLV -0.68) on low volume (0.47 RelVol). This confirms selling pressure continuation despite low volume, indicating a probable downside move or deep consolidation within the bullish trend.

**Key Levels:** $69.52 (Immediate Supply), $64.18 (Major Low/Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $64.18 on increasing volume.

The last weekly bar shows a wide spread UP bar closing near the high (CLV 0.77) on average volume (0.58 RelVol). This is strong bullish action, confirming demand entry and absorption after the prior weakness. The market is resuming its bullish trend, supported by the higher time frame Stopping Volume indication.

**Key Levels:** $68.20 (New High/Target), $63.47 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan

The last week is a tight spread down bar, closing near the low (CLV -0.81) on high relative volume (0.93 RelVol), suggesting continued weakness and institutional follow-through. The move is highly bearish.

### HDB (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance Continuation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH, confirmed by the weekly SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (WATCH_FOR_TEST). Three weeks ago, there was a massive Shakeout/Distribution event (52.9M volume, 2.88 RelVol) resulting in a wide spread down bar closing near the low (CLV -0.90). This indicates clear institutional unloading. The subsequent bars are tight spread down, maintaining the low price level on diminishing volume, confirming No Demand. The last bar is a tight spread up bar (CLV 0.05) on low volume (0.62 RelVol), confirming institutional disinterest in accumulating here, favoring the downside continuation.

**Key Levels:** $33.59 (Immediate Supply), $31.97 (Major Low/Support)

The last two bars continued downward, with the most recent bar being a down bar closing mid-range (CLV -0.39) on low volume (0.39 RelVol). The ongoing weakness and lack of demand response, despite lower prices, confirms the immediate bearish pressure.

**Key Levels:** $21.11 (Immediate Supply), $20.07 (Recent Low/Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $20.07 on volume.

### KDP (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Monthly) / Accumulation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH. The monthly sequence shows CONFIRMED_EARLY BUYING_CLIMAX, suggesting a likely consolidation/correction. The last two weekly bars show tight ranges and indecision, but the most recent bar is an UP bar closing near the high (CLV 0.67) on average volume (0.42 RelVol). This move up on low volume suggests a successful Test of Supply (No Supply) and confirms institutional absorption/accumulation near the $27.00 support area, setting up the next leg higher.

**Key Levels:** $28.36 (Resistance), $27.07 (Support/Accumulation Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close above $28.12 on volume.

The Quarterly trend is BEARISH, but the weekly sequence is CONFIRMED_EARLY STOPPING_VOLUME.

The Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the weekly sequence shows a clear BUYING_CLIMAX (11.9M volume, 2.09 RelVol, wide spread, poor close CLV -0.05) two weeks ago, confirming institutional selling into strength (distribution). The last weekly bar is a wide spread down bar, closing near the low (CLV -0.59) on low volume (0.58 RelVol). The market failed to hold the high ground despite high volume, confirming Smart Money unloading. The low volume downside move suggests a lack of demand stepping in to absorb the selling.

**Key Levels:** $361.58 (Climax High/Major Resistance), $340.27 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $340.27 on volume.

### RARE (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance Continuation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH, reinforced by the weekly CONFIRMED_EARLY SUPPLY_DOMINANCE and monthly SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The chart is highly volatile after a massive crash (4.56 RelVol spike three weeks ago). The last two weeks show clear bearish attempts with wide spread down bars closing near the low (CLV -0.91, then CLV 0.31 on a bounce). The last bar is a tight spread UP bar closing mid-range (CLV 0.31) on very low volume (0.46 RelVol). This is a classic No Demand scenario following massive selling, indicating Smart Money disinterest in accumulating, favoring further downside.

The last two weekly bars are wide spread UP bars closing at the high (CLV 0.96 and CLV 0.96) on average to low volume (0.90 RelVol and 0.53 RelVol). This sustained strength and tight closes near the high, despite the monthly warning, confirms strong demand and institutional drive upward. The low volume suggests a lack of counter-supply.

### RLI (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply (NS) after Buying Climax reaction

**Smart Money Logic:**
Following the monthly Buying Climax warning, the price experienced a sharp correction on high volume (Jan 5 & 12). The final weekly bar saw volume drop significantly (RelVol 0.50) while the price stabilized and closed positively (CLV 0.42). This low-volume bounce is a classic No Supply signal, indicating sellers have temporarily exhausted themselves and demand is preparing a counter-move.

**VSA Status:** Demand Absorption / Confirmation of Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
The highest volume week (Jan 12, RelVol 1.91) saw price attempt a breakout but close mid-range, suggesting initial Stopping Volume/Supply. However, the subsequent week (Jan 19) absorbed selling pressure (opening lower) and closed strongly near the high (CLV 0.80) on high relative volume (1.31). This confirms demand absorption and preparation for a further rally.

**Key Levels:** 32.20 (Resistance/Breakout Level), 30.60 (Demand Support)

Following weeks of strong demand, 01-19 was a wide spread down bar closing near the low. The volume is below average high volume, suggesting a sharp shakeout rather than massive distribution. Needs confirmation that supply is absent.

**Key Levels:** 273.27 (Recent Resistance), 272.22 (Current Support), 258.00 (Monthly Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A narrow, low volume bar (Test/No Supply) near 272.22, followed by an up thrust.
- **Invalidation:** 258.00
---
### AIG (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Low Volume Down Drift / No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
After a high volume Selling Climax (01-05), the price failed to rebound meaningfully. The latest bar is a low volume drift down with a weak close, signaling that demand is absent and minor supply is sufficient to push price lower.

**Key Levels:** 72.11 (Support/SC low), 76.04 (Initial resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 72.11 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** 76.04
---
### AIQ (NEUTRAL/Caution)
**VSA Status:** No Demand / Preliminary Weakness

**Smart Money Logic:**
The rally attempted after the monthly Stopping Volume was rejected by supply (01-12). The latest bar is low volume, drifting down to the low of the week, suggesting demand is weak and Smart Money is not defending this level effectively.

**Key Levels:** 50.87 (Recent Support), 53.25 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 51.75 on high volume.
- **Invalidation:** 50.87
---
### AL (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Ultra-Tight Consolidation/Absorption

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stock has been trading in an extremely tight, low-volume range for several weeks despite a confirmed Monthly Buying Climax warning. This suggests supply from the climax event is being absorbed, but definitive directional movement is pending the breakout of the consolidation range.

**Key Levels:** 64.40 (Resistance), 64.10 (Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close above 64.40 on high volume.
- **Invalidation:** 64.00
---
### AMBA (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Demand / Weakness

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Stopping Volume attempt on 01-12 failed to secure immediate bullish follow-through. The 01-19 bar shows a low volume drift down closing poorly, indicating demand is absent and the price is vulnerable to retesting lows.

**Key Levels:** 70.77 (Resistance), 64.00 (Support/SC Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 65.24 on confirming volume.
- **Invalidation:** 67.70
---
### AMZU (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Rejection / No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
Strong rally was rejected by supply at $40 (01-12). The latest bar is a low volume down bar closing weakly, signaling that Smart Money is distributing and demand has vanished, leaving the stock vulnerable.

**Key Levels:** 40.40 (Supply Resistance), 34.15 (Recent Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 34.15 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** 35.93
---
### ARWR (NEUTRAL/Caution)
**VSA Status:** Weak Reaction Rally / Test of Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
Supply Dominance was confirmed on 01-05. The subsequent low volume rally (01-19) indicates a temporary halt in selling, but the lack of committed demand (low volume) means the price is still likely subject to the overall supply pressure.

**Key Levels:** 65.33 (Local Resistance), 61.65 (Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close above 65.33 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** 60.61
---
### AZN (NEUTRAL/Caution)
**VSA Status:** Failed Stopping Volume Follow-through / Weakness

**Smart Money Logic:**
Massive Stopping Volume (01-12) failed to prevent the price from dropping immediately the next week. The poor close on 01-19 suggests residual supply is still dominant, casting doubt on the immediate bullish reversal.

**Key Levels:** 91.12 (Resistance), 89.17 (SV Test Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short Entry: Break below 89.17.
- **Invalidation:** 96.43
---
### BAH (NEUTRAL/Caution)
**VSA Status:** Preliminary Weakness / Shakeout Down

**Smart Money Logic:**
Monthly Buying Climax suggests distribution is imminent. The 01-19 bar shows a wide spread down, closing near the low, suggesting strong selling pressure or a decisive shakeout. The low volume suggests low conviction on the bullish side.

**Key Levels:** 98.19 (Resistance), 93.38 (Support/Shakeout Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 93.38 on high volume.
- **Invalidation:** 96.94
---
### BBIO (NEUTRAL/Caution)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result Up (ENR-U) / Weak Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
High volume on 01-12 suggested institutional distribution near $80 (ENR). The subsequent low-volume rally (01-19) lacks conviction, suggesting supply remains an issue. Need a clearer demand signal.

**Key Levels:** 79.88 (Supply Resistance), 73.77 (Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Bearish: Break below 73.77 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** 78.58
---
### BE (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Preliminary Weakness/Resting after massive push

**Smart Money Logic:**
Massive demand surge over two weeks, supporting the monthly SV context. The latest bar is a low volume pause near the peak. This is a typical resting period, but high volatility requires confirmation of continued demand before entry.

**Key Levels:** 155.31 (Resistance/High), 143.20 (Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close above 155.31 on high volume.
- **Invalidation:** 143.20
---
### BFH (NEUTRAL/Caution)
**VSA Status:** Failed Test / Preliminary Weakness

**Smart Money Logic:**
A strong Stopping Volume signal (01-12) was immediately negated by a sharp, poor closing bar on low volume (01-19). This suggests the accumulation failed immediately, or a deeper shakeout is necessary to clear supply.

**Key Levels:** 74.17 (Resistance), 69.70 (Support/SV Test Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A narrow range, low volume bar near 69.70.
- **Invalidation:** 69.70
---
### BKSY (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result Down (ENR-D) / Weakness

**Smart Money Logic:**
Confirmed Monthly Buying Climax. The wide spread down on 01-19, closing poorly on low volume, indicates that the demand attempting to push price higher failed, confirming weakness and vulnerability to markdown.

**Key Levels:** 29.79 (Supply Resistance), 25.46 (Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 25.46 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** 29.47
---
### BNS (NEUTRAL/Caution)
**VSA Status:** Low Volume Pullback / No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
Supply hit hard on 01-05, followed by a demand counter-attack (01-12). The subsequent bar (01-19) is a low volume pullback, showing demand is absent during the test. Stuck in a struggle zone.

**Key Levels:** 74.97 (Supply Resistance), 72.93 (Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Bullish: Break above 73.86 on increasing volume. Bearish: Break below 72.93 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** 71.63
---
### BRZE (NEUTRAL/Caution)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax Reaction / Churning

**Smart Money Logic:**
Extreme Supply Dominance (01-12 SC) led to a massive drop. The 01-19 bar is a high-volume attempt to rally, suggesting supply is still meeting demand (churning). Needs a low volume test or consolidation to confirm accumulation is successful.

**Key Levels:** 24.55 (Resistance), 22.65 (Support/SC Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** High volume breakout above 24.55.
- **Invalidation:** 22.65
---
### CAI (NEUTRAL/Caution)
**VSA Status:** Failed SV Follow-through / Churning

**Smart Money Logic:**
High volume SV (01-05) was immediately countered by massive supply on 01-12, leading to a poor close. This indicates a fierce battle where supply currently holds the tactical edge. The current low volume pause needs a clear resolution.

**Key Levels:** 29.32 (Resistance/Supply), 25.75 (Support/Test Zone)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry: Break below 25.75 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** 24.69
---
### CBSH (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Demand / Weakness

**Smart Money Logic:**
Supply near $55 prevented significant rally. The latest bar is a low volume, wide spread down bar closing on the low, confirming absence of demand defense, aligning with the monthly SD context.

**Key Levels:** 55.66 (Resistance), 53.41 (Recent Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 53.41 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** 54.44
---
### CCOI (NEUTRAL/Caution)
**VSA Status:** No Demand / Preliminary Weakness

**Smart Money Logic:**
Strong demand wave met with a subsequent low volume pullback that closed poorly. Given the Monthly Buying Climax, this lack of demand defense makes the price vulnerable to reversal.

**Key Levels:** 24.23 (Resistance), 22.79 (Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 22.79 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** 24.01
---
### CNXC (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly chart shows Stopping Volume (9.57M volume, high spread) followed by a sharp reaction down (last weekly candle: high volume, tight spread, closing near the low, CLV -0.90). This confirms institutional selling pressure/profit-taking after the initial Stopping Volume. The last candle is weak (down move on low relative volume 0.44), suggesting the selling pressure is dissipating, setting up a potential Test of Supply (or Shakeout) near the recent low ($40.0). The Quarterly trend is BULLISH, suggesting this weekly weakness is likely a correction/accumulation phase.

**Key Levels:** $44.78 (High Supply), $40.00 (Recent Low/Support), $41.96 (Previous Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A definitive low volume Test of the $40.0 area, or a strong UP bar with widening spread confirming demand entry.
- **Invalidation:** $37.84 (Below major weekly low)
---
### CORT (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Weak Follow-through)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly chart showed significant Stopping Volume (30.3M volume, large spread) two periods ago, resulting in a gap down followed by volatility. However, the subsequent price action shows continued bearishness in a BEARISH_TREND Quarterly context. The last two weekly bars are tight spread, suggesting decreasing institutional activity. The most recent bar is UP, tight spread, on low volume (0.51 RelVol, CLV 0.97), suggesting No Supply confirmation, but the overall monthly sequence is SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (WATCH_FOR_TEST). Requires a clear bullish confirmation above immediate resistance.

**Key Levels:** $38.20 (Recent High/Supply Zone), $32.99 (Major Low/Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A strong break and close above $38.20 on high volume.
- **Invalidation:** $32.99 (Below major support/stopping volume low)
---
### CRBG (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result Down (Monthly Buying Climax)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BEARISH. The monthly chart indicates a BUYING_CLIMAX (WATCH_FOR_TEST), suggesting the recent accumulation is being challenged. The last weekly bar is a wide spread down bar closing near the low (CLV -0.87) on relatively low volume (0.27 RelVol). While the low volume suggests institutional absence, the preceding wide spread bar (01/12) closed mildly up on high volume (0.91 RelVol), showing Effort without significant bullish Result, followed by weakness. This looks like a continuation of the monthly distribution/pullback within a weaker context.

**Key Levels:** $30.92 (Immediate Resistance), $29.35 (Recent Low/Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $29.35 with volume confirmation.
- **Invalidation:** $31.50 (Above recent high)
---
### CSGP (NEUTRAL / BEARISH Bias)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Shakeout

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly context is BEARISH. The weekly chart shows massive volume (37M, 2.05 RelVol) resulting in a wide spread down bar closing near the low (CLV -0.98), confirming a major Shakeout/distribution phase in early January. The follow-up week saw higher volume (2.16 RelVol) but closed strongly UP (CLV 0.86), suggesting initial accumulation/absorption of the supply. The last weekly candle is indecisive (tight spread, closed mid-range, 0.55 RelVol). The market is currently consolidating high volatility. Given the Quarterly BEARISH context and the confirmed Supply Dominance, the bias remains cautious until demand is clearly established above the range.

**Key Levels:** $57.00 (Major Support/Shakeout Low), $65.93 (Immediate Supply/Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close above $65.93 on high volume, confirming absorption.
- **Invalidation:** $57.00 (Below Shakeout low)
---
### DOW (NEUTRAL / BEARISH Bias)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Monthly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the monthly sequence shows CONFIRMED_EARLY SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The price saw significant volatility two weeks ago (28.52 high) resulting in a wide spread UP bar closing mid-range (CLV 0.22) on high volume (1.02 RelVol), suggesting potential weakness/absorption at the high. The subsequent bar is tight spread down, closing near the low (CLV -0.36) on low volume (0.38 RelVol). While the long-term context is bullish, the recent monthly weakness and the poor last weekly close signal a required consolidation or retracement. Need to monitor if demand steps in quickly.

**Key Levels:** $28.52 (Supply/Resistance), $26.30 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A definitive UP bar Test on low volume in the $26.30-$26.50 range, or a volume surge above $27.16.
- **Invalidation:** $26.06 (Below recent swing low)
---
### ENR (NEUTRAL / BEARISH Bias)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Monthly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the monthly chart shows SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (WATCH_FOR_TEST). Two weeks ago, the price showed a wide spread down bar (CLV -0.70) on above-average volume (0.88 RelVol), suggesting distribution/profit-taking. The last weekly bar is a tight spread down bar, closing near the low (CLV -0.58) on low volume (0.45 RelVol). This indicates a lack of immediate buying interest following the shakeout. The market needs to find support or demonstrate clear accumulation before resuming the bullish trend.

**Key Levels:** $21.64 (Immediate Resistance), $19.71 (Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A definitive low volume Test near $19.71 or a strong UP bar clearing $20.34.
- **Invalidation:** $18.92 (Below recent shakeout low)
---
### FER (NEUTRAL / BULLISH Bias)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Potential Retracement)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH. The monthly sequence shows BUYING_CLIMAX (WATCH_FOR_TEST). Two weeks ago, the price saw a strong UP bar (CLV 0.65) on average volume (0.89 RelVol). The last weekly bar is a tight spread down bar closing at the extreme low (CLV -0.95) on very low volume (0.34 RelVol). The extreme weak close on low volume suggests a temporary failure of demand. This could be interpreted as a shakeout following the Buying Climax high ($68.54). Given the bullish context, we anticipate a potential Test of demand.

**Key Levels:** $68.54 (Climax High/Resistance), $66.31 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A narrow spread, high volume Test UP bar or a break above $67.66 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** $65.09 (Below previous low prior to strong move)
---
### FFIV (NEUTRAL / BEARISH Bias)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Monthly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the monthly context shows STOPPING_VOLUME (WATCH_FOR_TEST), which often precedes a change in trend or heavy consolidation. Two weeks ago, the price saw a wide spread UP bar (CLV -0.54) on high volume (1.22 RelVol), suggesting institutional distribution at the top of the rally. The last weekly bar is a wide spread down bar closing near the low (CLV -0.93) on very low volume (0.38 RelVol). The weakness on low volume confirms lack of demand, aligning with the expected consolidation post-Stopping Volume/Distribution.

**Key Levels:** $280.75 (Monthly High/Supply), $259.44 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A successful Test of Supply near $259.44 (low volume up close) or a break above $267.05.
- **Invalidation:** $254.21 (Below recent swing low)
---
### FIBK (NEUTRAL / BEARISH Bias)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Monthly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the monthly sequence is CONFIRMED_EARLY BUYING_CLIMAX, suggesting a likely top. The weekly price action is choppy near the highs. Two weeks ago, the bar was wide spread UP (CLV 0.10) on high volume (1.05 RelVol), suggesting effort without result (supply present). The last weekly bar is a wide spread down bar closing near the low (CLV -0.62) on low volume (0.31 RelVol). This weakness on low volume confirms immediate lack of demand, aligning with distribution expected after a Buying Climax.

**Key Levels:** $38.00 (Monthly High/Supply), $35.95 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Failure to hold $35.95 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** $38.00 (Above major high)
---
### GBCI (NEUTRAL / BEARISH Bias)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Monthly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the monthly sequence is CONFIRMED_EARLY SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. Two weeks ago, the price saw high volume (1.09 RelVol) resulting in a wide spread UP bar closing mid-range (CLV 0.30), showing supply meeting effort. The last weekly bar is tight spread, closing near the middle (CLV -0.02) on very low volume (0.26 RelVol). The low volume suggests a successful Test of Supply/No Demand, setting the stage for a pullback, confirming the monthly weakness signal.

**Key Levels:** $48.88 (Supply/Resistance), $46.50 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $46.50 with volume for short counter-trend, or wait for demand confirmation near $44.38.
- **Invalidation:** $48.88 (Above recent high)
---
### GNTX (NEUTRAL / BEARISH Bias)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Monthly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the monthly sequence is CONFIRMED_EARLY SUPPLY_DOMINANCE, suggesting a strong counter-trend correction is likely. Two weeks ago, volume was high (1.21 RelVol) with a wide spread UP bar closing mid-range (CLV -0.01), showing Effort No Result (Supply presence). The last weekly bar is a tight spread down bar closing near the middle (CLV -0.49) on very low volume (0.28 RelVol). The weak action on low volume indicates No Demand and confirms the current distribution phase suggested by the monthly chart.

**Key Levels:** $24.53 (Immediate Supply), $23.34 (Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Failure to hold $23.34 with increased volume.
- **Invalidation:** $24.53 (Above recent high)
---
### HRMY (NEUTRAL / BEARISH Bias)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Monthly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the monthly sequence is SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (WATCH_FOR_TEST). Two weeks ago, the price saw a wide spread down bar (CLV -0.34) on high volume (1.03 RelVol), suggesting distribution/shakeout. The last weekly bar is a tight spread down bar, closing mid-range (CLV -0.19) on low volume (0.35 RelVol). This lack of immediate demand follow-through suggests that the upward move is temporarily exhausted and the monthly distribution might lead to a deeper correction.

**Key Levels:** $39.40 (Supply/Resistance), $35.15 (Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $35.15 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** $39.40 (Above recent high)
---
### IONQ (NEUTRAL / BULLISH Bias)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Monthly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH, with the monthly showing CONFIRMED_EARLY BUYING_CLIMAX. This suggests consolidation or retracement before continuation. Two weeks ago, the bar was a wide spread UP bar closing mid-range (CLV 0.51) on high volume (0.74 RelVol), suggesting supply absorption. The last weekly bar is a wide spread UP bar, closing mid-range (CLV -0.26) on low volume (0.39 RelVol). The mid-range close and low volume suggests institutional demand is pausing after absorbing supply, but remains in control. A strong close above the recent high is required.

**Key Levels:** $54.24 (Supply/Resistance), $48.56 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close above $54.24 on high volume.
- **Invalidation:** $47.33 (Below accumulation zone low)
---
### IREN (NEUTRAL / BULLISH Bias)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Monthly) / Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the monthly sequence is SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (WATCH_FOR_TEST). Two weeks ago, the price saw massive volume (226M, 1.19 RelVol) with a wide spread UP bar closing near the high (CLV 0.85), suggesting significant demand and potential Buying Climax. The last weekly bar is a wide spread down bar, closing mid-range (CLV -0.56) on low volume (0.47 RelVol). The lack of strong follow-through on the downside suggests supply is currently pausing, and given the bullish context, this may be an automatic reaction (AR) after the climax. The trend remains up, but caution is warranted.

**Key Levels:** $58.75 (Climax High/Resistance), $53.33 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close above $57.81 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** $53.33 (Below consolidation low)
---
### ITT (NEUTRAL / BEARISH Bias)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Monthly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH, reinforced by the monthly SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The last weekly bar is a wide spread down bar closing mid-range (CLV -0.40) on very low volume (0.31 RelVol). This suggests a pause in active institutional selling but also a confirmation of No Demand stepping in. The overall chart structure remains weak following the large distribution events previously noted (high volume/wide spread down bars).

**Key Levels:** $182.77 (Immediate Supply), $178.48 (Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $178.48 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** $185.00 (Above major high)
---
### KEY (NEUTRAL / BULLISH Bias)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Monthly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the monthly sequence is CONFIRMED_EARLY SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. Two weeks ago, the price saw high volume (0.79 RelVol) with a wide spread UP bar closing mid-range (CLV 0.43), indicating supply present (Effort No Result). The last weekly bar is a wide spread UP bar, closing mid-range (CLV 0.31) on low volume (0.44 RelVol). The close off the high on average volume indicates difficulty progressing upward, confirming the monthly distribution signal. However, the overall trend is bullish, suggesting a consolidation/shakeout before continuation.

**Key Levels:** $21.56 (Supply/Resistance), $20.97 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A strong UP close above $21.56 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** $20.55 (Below recent swing low)
---
### KYMR (NEUTRAL / BEARISH Bias)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Monthly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the monthly sequence is BUYING_CLIMAX (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The last three weeks show heavy institutional selling (wide spreads down, closing near lows, on high volume followed by lower volume pauses). Two weeks ago, the bar was wide spread down (CLV -0.96) on average volume (0.70 RelVol). The last weekly bar is an UP bar closing mid-range (CLV 0.55) on low volume (0.47 RelVol). While the up close is positive, the prior distribution/climax makes this rally suspicious (Test of Supply). The primary risk remains a deeper correction.

**Key Levels:** $76.70 (Immediate Supply), $66.20 (Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Failure to sustain upward momentum and break below $66.20.
- **Invalidation:** $77.92 (Above recent reaction high)
---
### MAN (NEUTRAL / BEARISH Bias)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Monthly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the monthly sequence is CONFIRMED_EARLY SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. Two weeks ago, the price saw high volume (0.89 RelVol) with a wide spread down bar closing mid-range (CLV -0.39), indicating supply presence. The last weekly bar is a tight spread UP bar, closing mid-range (CLV 0.03) on low volume (0.42 RelVol). This suggests institutional demand is absent/weak, following the prior supply signal. Expecting a further retracement/consolidation aligned with the monthly distribution.

**Key Levels:** $31.61 (Immediate Supply), $28.82 (Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $28.82 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** $31.61 (Above recent high)
---
### NICE (NEUTRAL / BULLISH Bias)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Monthly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the monthly sequence is SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (WATCH_FOR_TEST). Two weeks ago, the price saw high volume (1.46 RelVol) with a wide spread down bar closing mid-range (CLV -0.36), indicating selling pressure/distribution. The last weekly bar is an UP bar, closing mid-range (CLV -0.05) on low volume (0.64 RelVol). The weak bullish follow-through on low volume suggests a failure of demand (No Demand), but within a bullish trend, this is often a pause before a Test or rally continuation.

**Key Levels:** $118.37 (Supply/Resistance), $109.30 (Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A strong UP bar closing above $115.20 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** $109.30 (Below recent swing low)
---
### ONB (NEUTRAL / BULLISH Bias)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Monthly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the monthly sequence is CONFIRMED_STRONG SUPPLY_DOMINANCE, suggesting a significant corrective phase. Two weeks ago, the price saw high volume (0.82 RelVol) with an UP bar closing mid-range (CLV 0.55), showing supply present (Effort No Result). The last weekly bar is a tight spread down bar, closing near the low (CLV -0.86) on very low volume (0.26 RelVol). This confirms No Demand, aligning with the expected consolidation or pullback following the strong distribution signal from the monthly chart.

**Key Levels:** $23.50 (Supply/Resistance), $22.87 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $22.87 on volume, or a strong UP bar above $23.50.
- **Invalidation:** $23.50 (Above recent high)
---
### PSN (NEUTRAL / BULLISH Bias)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Monthly) / Demand Entry

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH, but the monthly sequence is CONFIRMED_EARLY SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (suggesting weakness after a recent strong move down). Two weeks ago, the price saw demand enter (high CLV 0.82) on average volume (0.74 RelVol). The last weekly bar is a tight spread down bar, closing mid-range (CLV -0.48) on low volume (0.49 RelVol). The low volume downside move is weak, potentially signaling a No Supply Test after the previous demand surge. Given the recent demand, the market might be pausing before a counter-trend rally.

**Key Levels:** $72.80 (Immediate Supply/Resistance), $70.73 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close above $72.69 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** $68.84 (Below consolidation zone low)
---
### PTGX (NEUTRAL / BEARISH Bias)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Monthly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH, supported by the monthly BUYING_CLIMAX (WATCH_FOR_TEST). Two weeks ago, the price saw a wide spread UP bar closing mid-range (CLV -0.25) on average volume (0.76 RelVol), indicating supply absorption or Effort No Result. The last weekly bar is a wide spread UP bar, closing near the high (CLV 0.88) on low volume (0.34 RelVol). This suggests a positive Test of Supply/No Supply, but given the bearish quarterly context and the monthly climax warning, this strength should be approached cautiously as a potential final burst before a deeper correction.

**Key Levels:** $87.44 (Immediate Supply), $79.87 (Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close above $87.44 on volume for bullish confirmation, or failure below $79.87 for bearish continuation.
- **Invalidation:** $78.75 (Below recent low)

### RF (NEUTRAL / BEARISH Bias)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Monthly)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the monthly sequence is SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (WATCH_FOR_TEST). Two weeks ago, the price saw a wide spread down bar (CLV -0.32) on very high volume (0.87 RelVol), confirming supply stepping in. The last weekly bar is a tight spread down bar, closing mid-range (CLV -0.10) on low volume (0.41 RelVol). The weak downside move on low volume suggests a paused selling effort, but the failure to rally or find strong demand indicates a likely continuation of the monthly correction phase.

**Key Levels:** $28.61 (Immediate Supply/Resistance), $27.25 (Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below $27.25 on volume.
- **Invalidation:** $28.61 (Above recent high)

### RGTI (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result / Low Volume Pullback

**Smart Money Logic:**
The price saw a strong rally attempt in early January (reaching 26.70 on high volume) which failed to maintain a strong close, indicating overhead supply. The most recent weekly bar closed poorly on extremely low volume (RelVol 0.29), suggesting a lack of institutional demand to support the price or a period of apathy following a shakeout. A Test of the support zone is necessary.

**Key Levels:** 27.00 (Resistance), 22.30 (Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Successful low volume Test/No Supply near 22.30, or a high volume break above 25.70.
- **Invalidation:** Weekly close below 22.00

### RKT (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
An extreme high volume surge (Jan 5) was immediately countered by heavy institutional selling (Jan 12). The subsequent low volume week (Jan 19, RelVol 0.33) saw the price continue to drop and close poorly, confirming the supply pressure and signaling No Demand. This suggests a deep pullback is likely, testing the base of the recent breakout.

**Key Levels:** 24.36 (Supply Peak), 19.80 (Primary Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 21.80 on increasing volume (short continuation).
- **Invalidation:** Weekly close above 23.50

### SA (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result (Low Volume Rally)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Price experienced Supply Dominance in early January. The recent weekly bar rallied sharply to a new swing high (33.15) and closed strongly (CLV 0.81), but did so on extremely low relative volume (0.45). This 'Effort No Result' suggests a rally without institutional backing, making it vulnerable to immediate reversal unless followed by a high-volume push or a strong low-volume test.

**Key Levels:** 33.15 (Resistance), 30.00 (Major Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Confirmed high volume breakout above 33.15.
- **Invalidation:** Weekly close below 30.00

### SPOT (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax / Confirmed Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last two weeks saw extraordinary liquidation, confirmed by extreme high volume (RelVol 1.53, 1.94) and massive wide down bars (CLV -0.91, -0.84). This points to heavy institutional distribution/panic selling. The minor rebound on Jan 19 was on low volume, typical of a weak short-covering rally (No Demand) that fails to absorb the immense overhead supply.

**Key Levels:** 550.00 (Initial Supply Resistance), 500.00 (Immediate Psychological Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for clear accumulation signs (Spring/Test) or short continuation below 500.00.
- **Invalidation:** Weekly close above 550.00
---
### SYF (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume followed by Supply Rejection

**Smart Money Logic:**
Strong institutional demand appeared (Stopping Volume, Jan 12, RelVol 1.85) to halt the bearish trend. However, the immediate following week saw a sharp reversal, closing near the low on a wide spread (CLV -0.74). This indicates that the initial SV attracted significant overhead supply, suggesting the accumulation phase is complex and requires further testing of the 74.95 low.

**Key Levels:** 81.84 (Immediate Resistance), 74.95 (Critical Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Successful low volume Test/No Supply near 75.50.
- **Invalidation:** Weekly close below 74.50
---
### TFX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Confirmed Supply Dominance / Continuation Markdown

**Smart Money Logic:**
Two weeks of extreme high volume and wide down bars (Jan 5 & 12) confirmed heavy liquidation and Supply Dominance. The last week stabilized slightly but closed very poorly (CLV -0.82) on low volume (RelVol 0.52), confirming a lack of demand. The markdown phase is in effect and expected to continue toward the 100 level.

**Key Levels:** 113.00 (Overhead Supply), 100.18 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below 100.00 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** Weekly close above 105.00

### TRU (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Monthly) followed by Weekly Supply Rejection

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly chart signaled strong Stopping Volume, suggesting accumulation. However, the recent weekly rally attempt (Jan 12) was immediately negated by a sharp sell-off bar (Jan 19) closing low, indicating significant overhead supply or profit taking by Smart Money. This confirms the price is currently in a reaction phase within a larger accumulation range (81.08 to 89.12).

**Key Levels:** 89.12 (Accumulation High), 81.08 (Accumulation Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Low volume retest (No Supply) near 81.50.
- **Invalidation:** Weekly close below 80.50
---
### USIG (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Distribution

**Smart Money Logic:**
In this low volatility instrument, the extreme high volume bar on Jan 12 (RelVol 2.36) that failed to produce a strong close near the high signals heavy institutional distribution near 52.12. The subsequent low volume week dropped and closed poorly (CLV -0.63), confirming No Demand and indicating that Smart Money has successfully distributed shares at the high of the range.

**Key Levels:** 52.12 (Distribution High), 51.60 (Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and weekly close below 51.60 on increased volume.
- **Invalidation:** Weekly close above 52.12
---
### VONG (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
Despite a monthly Stopping Volume warning, the weekly chart shows strong downside control. The high volume selling bar (Jan 12, RelVol 2.51) saw price close poorly. This was followed by a continuation down on low volume (Jan 19, RelVol 0.69) with a very poor close, confirming No Demand. The immediate price action suggests markdown is continuing and the monthly accumulation requires more time.

**Key Levels:** 121.70 (Supply Resistance), 117.80 (Immediate Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below 117.80.
- **Invalidation:** Weekly close above 121.00
---
### WGMI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax followed by Upthrust/Reversal

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly bar on Jan 12 was a powerful wide-spread bar closing near the high, signaling a potential climax (51.78). This was immediately confirmed by the Jan 19 bar, which sold off sharply and closed poorly, acting as an Upthrust or reversal bar. This confirms the monthly Buying Climax warning and indicates Smart Money used the rally to distribute shares aggressively.

**Key Levels:** 51.78 (Climax High/Supply), 47.13 (Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below 47.00 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** Weekly close above 52.00
---
### WRB (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance followed by No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
The past two weeks showed sustained institutional selling pressure (high volume down bars). The most recent week (Jan 19) saw volume collapse (RelVol 0.31) but price failed to rally meaningfully, closing mid-range. This low volume bounce is a classic No Demand signal, suggesting the supply line is currently stronger and the markdown will likely continue.

**Key Levels:** 69.80 (Immediate Supply), 66.65 (Support Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below 66.65 on high volume.
- **Invalidation:** Weekly close above 68.50
