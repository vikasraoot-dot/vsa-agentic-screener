After a heavy sell-off on 2026-01-26, volume spiked to 1.48 RelVol on 2026-02-02 with a low CLV, suggesting smart money began absorbing supply. The subsequent bar shows a low volume bounce, indicating supply is drying up.

**Key Levels:** 30.96, 35.31

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 35.10 on rising volume
- **Invalidation:** 30.90

### BWIN (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
RelVol was extremely high (1.70) during the breakdown, but the current week shows a 0.75 RelVol and a very low CLV. This indicates a lack of buying interest even at lower prices.

**Key Levels:** 16.80, 19.91

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Failure to hold 17.00
- **Invalidation:** 19.60
---
### BX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Extremely high volume (2.44 RelVol) on the massive down bar of 2026-02-02 confirms aggressive institutional selling. The bounce on 2026-02-09 lacks relative volume (0.79), characterizing it as a 'dead cat bounce'.

**Key Levels:** 123.83, 135.56

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 127.00
- **Invalidation:** 140.80
---
### CADE (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result

**Smart Money Logic:**
Massive RelVol (4.79) on 2026-01-26 resulted in a relatively narrow spread and a close below the open. This indicates significant churning (buying meeting selling), creating a high-congestion zone.

**Key Levels:** 41.59, 43.58

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Clearance of 44.50 with volume expansion
- **Invalidation:** 41.50
---
### CAI (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
The volume spike on the 2026-01-26 drop followed by a very low volume week (RelVol 0.31) suggests that the supply generated during the sell-off has been exhausted.

**Key Levels:** 21.18, 23.15

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close above 23.20
- **Invalidation:** 21.10
---
### CBRL (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Monthly supply dominance is confirmed. The low volume retreat recently (0.18 RelVol) suggests the market is not being supported by professionals during this correction.

- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 32.50
- **Invalidation:** 34.00
---
### CCI (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 85.20
- **Invalidation:** 79.80
---
### CCOI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
Price is rising into new highs on significantly declining volume (RelVol 0.33). This is a 'No Demand' sign after a long bullish move, often preceding a reversal.

**Key Levels:** 22.30, 26.59

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Weak close below 26.00
- **Invalidation:** 26.65
---
### CDE (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
A massive volume sell-off (RelVol 2.03) on 2026-01-26 dominates the structure. The current bounce is on very low volume (0.42 RelVol), suggesting professionals are not participating in the upside.

**Key Levels:** 19.07, 23.45

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 21.60
- **Invalidation:** 23.00
---
### CIVI (BEARISH)

---
### CNXC (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 40.05
- **Invalidation:** 37.60
---
### CORT (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
Monthly sequence shows supply is appearing. The very low RelVol (0.20) on the current week following a high-volatility range suggests exhaustion of buying power.

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 40.30
- **Invalidation:** 42.00
---
### CPNG (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Consistent RelVol above 2.0 during down weeks suggests heavy institutional liquidation. The current low volume attempt to bounce (0.66 RelVol) is unlikely to hold.

**Key Levels:** 16.73, 20.97

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** New low below 17.70
- **Invalidation:** 18.80
---
### CRBG (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Low Volume Mark-Up

**Smart Money Logic:**
Price is drifting higher but volume is consistently falling (0.41 RelVol this week). This 'floating' behavior suggests a lack of institutional commitment on the long side.

- **Invalidation:** 30.40
---

- **Invalidation:** 52.35
---
### CTRA (BEARISH)

**Key Levels:** 24.68, 30.94

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 30.20
- **Invalidation:** 30.95
---
### CUZ (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 24.90
- **Invalidation:** 25.60
---
### CVS (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 73.00
- **Invalidation:** 78.60
---
### DOCU (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Institutional selling is evident from the high-volume down bars throughout Jan. The current low volume (0.49 RelVol) suggests the market is waiting for another leg down.

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 46.00
- **Invalidation:** 49.00
---
### DUOL (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Huge volume breakdown on 2026-02-02 (2.0 RelVol) suggests massive distribution. The current week shows a tiny dead cat bounce with very little RelVol (0.46).

- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 114.00
- **Invalidation:** 125.00
---
### ENR (BEARISH)

---
### ETHA (BULLISH)

- **Entry Trigger:** Break of 16.25
- **Invalidation:** 14.50
---
### EXPE (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

- **Invalidation:** 245.00

- **Invalidation:** 34.60
---
### FHB (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**

- **Invalidation:** 63.60
---
### GKOS (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
Price is at historical highs but volume has completely disappeared (0.20 RelVol). This lack of interest from big players at high prices typically precedes a drop.

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close below 110.00
- **Invalidation:** 115.20
---
### GNTX (BEARISH)

- **Invalidation:** 24.30
---
### GWRE (BEARISH)

- **Invalidation:** 133.60
---

- **Invalidation:** 20.40
---
### HUM (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

- **Entry Trigger:** Failure to hold 180.00
- **Invalidation:** 195.00
---
### ING (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

- **Invalidation:** 31.10
---
### IONQ (BEARISH)

- **Invalidation:** 36.50
---
### IONX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

- **Invalidation:** 12.70
---
### IQV (BEARISH)

- **Invalidation:** 194.80
---
### IREN (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Selling Pressure

**Smart Money Logic:**
High relative volume on wide-spread down bars indicates significant distribution. Monthly supply dominance confirms that the path of least resistance is down, with smart money dumping into the 60s.

- **Invalidation:** $54.00
---
### JPM (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
After a period of high volume selling, the most recent week shows very low relative volume (0.47) and a negative CLV. This indicates a lack of buying interest at current levels following a supply surge.

**Key Levels:** $315.12, $326.40, $296.51

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $315.00
- **Invalidation:** $327.00
---
### KDP (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Low Volume Consolidation

**Smart Money Logic:**
Volume is consistently below average while the price drifts higher. This lack of participation suggests smart money is not aggressively accumulating, likely awaiting better macro conditions or testing lower levels.

**Key Levels:** $27.85, $28.82, $27.08

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Volume spike above 80M with spread > $1.50
- **Invalidation:** $27.00
---
### KKR (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Selling Pressure

**Smart Money Logic:**
Extreme volume (RelVol 2.80) on the flush to $97 shows panicked liquidations. While there was a minor recovery, the overall weekly sequence is heavily dominated by supply bars.

- **Entry Trigger:** Retest of $100.00 with high volume
- **Invalidation:** $114.00
---
### KYMR (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Confirmed

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Close below $76.50
- **Invalidation:** $82.00
---
### LHX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
Extremely high volume at the $360+ levels in January with negative CLV in subsequent weeks suggests 'bag holding' where smart money passed shares to retail. Current volume is too low to sustain a breakout.

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $340.00
- **Invalidation:** $356.00

### MCO (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Massive spreads on high volume to the downside ($78 and $46 spreads). Professional interests are clearly liquidating positions. The lack of a high CLV on the flush suggests a lack of stopping volume.

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Failure to recover $425.00
- **Invalidation:** $460.00
---
### MNDY (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Extreme Selling Pressure

**Smart Money Logic:**
Successive weeks of RelVol over 2.4 while the price collapses suggests a total exit by institutions. Price is closing near the lows of the week consistently.

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Weak bounce to $85.00 on low volume
- **Invalidation:** $100.00
---
### MSFU (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
Monthly shows stopping volume which suggests a base is forming. However, the weekly RelVol is extremely high on down bars, meaning there is still a significant amount of supply to be absorbed.

**Key Levels:** $26.50, $32.05, $30.43

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Successful low volume test of $27.00
- **Invalidation:** $26.00

- **Entry Trigger:** High volume breakout above $25.00
- **Invalidation:** $21.50

- **Invalidation:** $92.00
---
### OZK (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

The rally to $51 occurred on low volume (RelVol 0.29) and resulted in a negative CLV. This is a clear sign of 'No Demand' after a major period of supply dominance.

**Key Levels:** $50.05, $51.64, $46.99

- **Entry Trigger:** Failure to clear $43.50
- **Invalidation:** $45.00

### PGY (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Selling Pressure

### PLTR (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Institutional distribution confirmed by the massive RelVol (1.96) on the down move in early February. The current low volume suggests a temporary pause before further downward movement.

- **Invalidation:** $80.00

- **Invalidation:** $52.50

### RGLD (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Selling Pressure

**Smart Money Logic:**
Huge spreads with high volume in January left a large amount of overhead supply. The recent recovery is on much lower volume, suggesting a lack of institutional demand to clear the hurdle.

- **Invalidation:** $21.50
---
### RLI (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** No Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
While supply has been dominant, the most recent week shows a high CLV (0.66) on very low volume (0.34). This suggests a pause in the selling, but we need an effort bar to confirm a trend change.

### RYAAY (BEARISH)

- **Invalidation:** $71.00

Massive supply entering at $22-$24 (RelVol 3.7). Although volume decreased recently, the price continues to struggle with any upward traction.

- **Invalidation:** $23.00

### SATS (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
Confirmed early buying climax on the monthly chart. High volume on weekly down bars in January suggests the peak is in and professionals have exited.

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Failure to hold $111.00
- **Invalidation:** $120.00

### SONY (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Consistent RelVol above 1.4 on down bars indicates heavy liquidation. The minor bounce on low volume (0.53) is likely to be sold into.

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $21.50
- **Invalidation:** $23.50

### SYF (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Test on Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
Significant supply entered the market on Jan 26 with high volume (RelVol 2.13). The current behavior shows price stabilizing on lower volume (RelVol 0.75), which is a 'Test'. However, the quarterly context is bearish, meaning we need a successful higher low before turning bullish.

**Key Levels:** 71.56, 75.43, 79.19

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** High volume breakout above 75.50
- **Invalidation:** 71.50
---
### TROW (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** No Demand

**Smart Money Logic:**
A major distribution event occurred on Feb 02 with high volume and a wide spread down. The 'recovery' on Feb 09 happened on exceptionally low volume (RelVol 0.58), signaling a lack of professional buying interest (No Demand).

**Key Levels:** 91.70, 97.67, 103.37

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break of Feb 02 low (91.70)
- **Invalidation:** 98.50
---
### TRU (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
Monthly stopping volume is confirmed. The weekly chart shows a massive effort to push lower on Feb 02 (RelVol 1.75) which resulted in a narrow CLV (0.12), suggesting smart money is starting to build a floor near the 65-70 zone.

**Key Levels:** 65.23, 75.71, 81.71

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Closing price above 76.00 with increased volume
- **Invalidation:** 65.23
---
### UBER (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
A decisive breakdown occurred on Feb 02 with high volume (RelVol 1.86). The following week saw even lower CLV and extremely low volume, indicating that there is currently no professional support at these levels.

**Key Levels:** 71.88, 75.05, 81.47

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Failure to hold 73.47
- **Invalidation:** 78.00
---
### UGI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Upthrust

**Smart Money Logic:**
The high volume on Jan 26 failed to sustain higher prices, followed by a violent downward move on Feb 02 with a CLV of -1.0. This indicates smart money has distributed their positions to retail 'bag holders' at the peak.

**Key Levels:** 36.57, 37.96, 41.34

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 36.93
- **Invalidation:** 39.00
---
### UNH (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Institutional liquidation is evident on Jan 26 (RelVol 2.97). The price continues to drift lower with no evidence of stopping volume or professional accumulation yet. Lack of demand is the primary driver.

**Key Levels:** 266.29, 280.40, 326.50

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short entry on weak rallies to 285
- **Invalidation:** 300.00
---
### VLTO (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
High volume selling on Feb 02 took out major support levels. The low-volume drift on Feb 09 indicates a lack of buyers willing to step in, characteristic of a market that has more downside to explore.

**Key Levels:** 88.40, 93.59, 97.08

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 90.50
- **Invalidation:** 94.00
---
### VONG (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Churning

**Smart Money Logic:**
Mixed signals are present. While monthly data shows stopping volume, the weekly sequence is dominated by supply. The sideways price action on declining volume suggests the market is waiting for a catalyst.

**Key Levels:** 114.49, 120.03, 123.60

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** High volume breakout above 121.00
- **Invalidation:** 114.40
---
### WGMI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
Extremely high volatility and volume on Feb 02 (RelVol 1.63) indicates panic selling. While price is trying to stabilize, the buying climax on the monthly chart suggests this is a long-term top being formed.

**Key Levels:** 34.99, 42.62, 52.01

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break of 34.99
- **Invalidation:** 45.00
---
### Z (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
A very clean breakdown on high volume occurred Feb 02. There has been no significant bounce or stopping volume detected yet. Low volume on Feb 09 indicates that the market is currently ignoring this stock (No Demand).

**Key Levels:** 53.61, 56.25, 62.66

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break of 53.61
- **Invalidation:** 58.00
