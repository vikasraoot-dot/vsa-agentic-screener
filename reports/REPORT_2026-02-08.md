## 🚀 Ready for Entry
### ABVX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Effort No Result

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence confirmed a Buying Climax. The monthly context is also confirmed as Supply Dominance. The week of 1/26 showed a wide spread DOWN bar (Spread 14.02) closing on the low (CLV -0.97) on average volume (RelVol 0.64), confirming weakness following the initial climax/shakeout attempt. The latest week (2/02) is a wide spread UP bar on average volume (RelVol 0.61) with a high close (CLV 0.90), which looks like a reaction rally into supply, possibly a Last Point of Supply (LPS). Given the Quarterly/Monthly Bearish trend and the confirmed Buying Climax, weakness is expected to resume.

**Key Levels:** 110.98 (Weakness confirmed below), 118.20 (Recent Resistance), 130.13 (Climax Top)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Weakness confirmation below $117.00 or a low volume failure near $118.20.
- **Invalidation:** $125.86 (Above recent key resistance)
---
### ADBE (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Down Thrust

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is Bearish, and weekly Supply Dominance is confirmed (Watch for Test). The trend is clearly down. The week of 1/26 was a wide spread DOWN bar on high volume (RelVol 1.22) with a close near the low (CLV -0.20), showing strong supply. The latest week (2/02) delivered an extremely wide spread DOWN bar (Spread 35.34) on very high volume (RelVol 1.83), closing near the low (CLV -0.75). This is a strong down thrust confirming institutional selling and breaking significant support. This is high effort leading to significant bearish result.

**Key Levels:** 295.42 (Broken Support/New Resistance), 284.60 (Immediate Resistance), 264.04 (Current Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A low volume rally back to test the broken support around $284.60 - $290.00 (LPSY).
- **Invalidation:** $306.30 (Above previous high volume resistance)
---
### ADSK (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Down Thrust

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is Bearish, and weekly Supply Dominance is confirmed (Watch for Test). Selling pressure has been consistent. The week of 1/26 showed a wide spread DOWN bar (Spread 27.05) on high volume (RelVol 1.34), closing near the low (CLV -0.58). The latest week (2/02) delivered another wide spread DOWN bar (Spread 25.66) on very high volume (RelVol 2.03), closing near the low (CLV -0.50). This high volume selling on wide spread bars confirms strong continued distribution and markdown. The market is firmly bearish.

**Key Levels:** 259.66 (Immediate Resistance), 247.20 (Broken Support/New Resistance), 234.00 (Current Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A low volume reaction rally (LPSY) back towards the $250-$255 zone.
- **Invalidation:** $274.25 (Above the prior swing high)
---
### AFRM (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Down Thrust

**Smart Money Logic:**
The market is deep in a markdown phase (Quarterly Bearish, weekly Supply Dominance). The selling accelerated drastically in the last two weeks. The week of 1/26 was a wide spread DOWN bar (Spread 11.65) on high volume (RelVol 1.08), closing near the low (CLV -0.89). The latest week (2/02) continued the severe markdown with a very wide spread bar (Spread 9.29) on extremely high volume (RelVol 2.52), closing poorly (CLV -0.63). This confirms extreme selling pressure. While the volume is climactic, the lack of positive price rejection suggests immediate distribution continuation rather than reversal.

**Key Levels:** 59.69 (Recent Support), 55.33 (Current Low), 64.62 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Any rally towards $60-$65 should be viewed as an opportunity to initiate shorts, targeting below $55.33.
- **Invalidation:** $70.00 (Above prior support/resistance zone)
---
### ALKT (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Down Thrust

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is Bearish, and weekly Supply Dominance is noted. The week of 1/26 was an Effort No Result Down (high volume, poor close, CLV -0.42), indicating supply absorption was potentially starting. However, the latest week (2/02) negated that hope with an extremely wide spread DOWN bar (Spread 5.20) on very high volume (RelVol 2.30), closing near the low (CLV -0.53). This is a strong down thrust, confirming strong institutional selling and continuation of the markdown. The earlier absorption attempt failed.

**Key Levels:** 20.25 (Broken Support/New Resistance), 16.23 (Current Low), 21.43 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A low volume rally towards $18.50-$19.50 (LPSY).
- **Invalidation:** $21.43 (Above the high of the recent down thrust)
---
### AMKR (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Demand Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is Bullish, but the monthly sequence suggests a Buying Climax (Watch for Test). The weekly bars from 1/12 to 1/26 showed a clear decline with high volume (1/12 wide spread down, 1/26 wide spread down, poor closes). This looked like distribution. However, the latest week (2/02) printed an extremely wide spread UP bar (Spread 7.85) on very high volume (RelVol 1.48), closing near the high (CLV 0.83). This is a strong Change of Character, clearing the immediate supply and confirming strong demand entering the market, likely negating the bearish interpretation of the recent pullback. This suggests a successful spring action and an immediate move up.

**Key Levels:** 42.14 (Spring Low/Support), 49.99 (Immediate Resistance), 55.17 (Prior High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A low volume pullback (Test) to the $47.79-$48.33 area, or a clean break above $49.99.
- **Invalidation:** $42.14 (Below the spring low)
---
### AMZN (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Down Thrust

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is bearish, and weekly Supply Dominance is noted. The week of 2/02 was a massive down thrust, printing an extremely wide spread DOWN bar (Spread 46.04) on institutional, climactic volume (RelVol 2.58). Although the CLV was -0.56, suggesting a close near the middle/low, the sheer scale of the bar and volume confirms massive institutional distribution and markdown continuation. This move broke major psychological support levels. The high volume suggests a major event, but the close being far from the high confirms the dominance of supply.

**Key Levels:** 236.74 (Broken Support/New Resistance), 200.31 (Current Low), 210.32 (Current Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A low volume reaction rally (LPSY) back towards the $220 area.
- **Invalidation:** $247.78 (Above the recent swing high)
---
### AMZU (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Down Thrust

**Smart Money Logic:**
Similar to AMZN, AMZU is in a severe markdown (Quarterly Bearish, weekly Supply Dominance). The week of 2/02 was a down thrust, printing an extremely wide spread DOWN bar (Spread 13.67) on very high volume (RelVol 3.13), closing poorly (CLV -0.58). This action confirms massive institutional distribution and markdown continuation, breaking the lows set during the prior weak monthly bar (Jan CLV 0.07). This is a clear sign of weakness.

**Key Levels:** 36.24 (Broken Support/New Resistance), 25.48 (Current Low), 28.32 (Current Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A low volume reaction rally (LPSY) back towards the $32-$34 area.
- **Invalidation:** $39.71 (Above the recent resistance high)
---
### APP (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Down Thrust

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is Bearish, and weekly Supply Dominance is noted. The recent selling has been brutal. The week of 1/26 delivered a very wide spread DOWN bar (Spread 106.83) on high volume (RelVol 1.16), closing near the low (CLV -0.81). The latest week (2/02) continued the devastation with an even wider spread DOWN bar (Spread 148.88) on extremely high volume (RelVol 2.00), closing near the low (CLV -0.37). While the CLV is slightly better, the sheer magnitude of the volume and range confirms institutional panic selling and markdown continuation. This move broke major multi-month support.

**Key Levels:** 463.08 (Broken Support/New Resistance), 360.12 (Current Low), 406.72 (Current Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A low volume reaction rally (LPSY) back towards the $440-$460 area.
- **Invalidation:** $509.00 (Above the high of the recent down thrust)
---
### APPN (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Down Thrust

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is Bearish, and weekly Supply Dominance is noted. The selling pressure has been relentless. The week of 1/26 was a wide spread DOWN bar on average volume (RelVol 1.25), closing poorly (CLV -0.82). The latest week (2/02) continued the markdown with a wide spread DOWN bar (Spread 4.42) on very high volume (RelVol 1.90), closing near the middle/low (CLV -0.39). The consistent high volume selling confirms institutional distribution and continuation of the bearish trend. This move broke the major psychological support at $28.00.

**Key Levels:** 27.59 (Broken Support/New Resistance), 23.88 (Current Low), 28.30 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A low volume reaction rally (LPSY) back towards $27.00.
- **Invalidation:** $29.70 (Above prior swing high)
---
### ARE (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Demand Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is Bullish, and the monthly sequence signals confirmed Stopping Volume. The week of 1/26 showed a wide spread DOWN bar (Spread 6.61) on very high volume (RelVol 1.53), closing near the low (CLV -0.54), indicating a shakeout/supply test. The latest week (2/02) immediately negated this potential weakness, printing an UP bar on high volume (RelVol 0.98) with a strong close (CLV 0.63). This confirms that demand aggressively absorbed the supply presented during the prior week's shakeout, suggesting the bullish trend is resuming.

**Key Levels:** 53.14 (Shakeout Low/Support), 56.52 (Immediate Resistance), 59.76 (Prior High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry on a low volume pullback (Test) to the $54.00-$54.50 area, or a high volume break above $56.52.
- **Invalidation:** $53.14 (Below the shakeout low)
---
### ARES (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Down Thrust

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is Bearish, and weekly Supply Dominance is noted, coinciding with a Monthly Buying Climax (Watch for Test). Selling pressure is accelerating. The week of 1/26 was a wide spread DOWN bar on high volume (RelVol 1.19), closing near the middle (CLV -0.12). The latest week (2/02) delivered a massive down thrust, printing an extremely wide spread DOWN bar (Spread 31.23) on institutional, climactic volume (RelVol 3.04), closing poorly (CLV -0.29). This confirms major institutional distribution and markdown continuation, invalidating any immediate recovery attempts. The price broke the major support at $145.46.

**Key Levels:** 145.46 (Broken Support/New Resistance), 119.40 (Current Low), 150.63 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A low volume reaction rally (LPSY) back towards the $140-$145 area.
- **Invalidation:** $155.74 (Above prior consolidation high)
---
### ATO (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Demand Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is Bullish, and a weekly Buying Climax is noted (Watch for Test). The prior two weeks (1/19, 1/26) showed evidence of supply entering (1/19 high volume, poor close; 1/26 very high volume, low CLV -0.22). This suggested a short-term shakeout. However, the latest week (2/02) delivered a strong, wide spread UP bar (Spread 10.07) on high volume (RelVol 1.69) with a strong close (CLV 0.36). This confirmed that demand has absorbed the recent supply and is pushing the price higher, likely targeting new highs. The bearish signals appear to have been part of a shakeout.

**Key Levels:** 164.50 (Shakeout Low/Support), 172.09 (Immediate Resistance), 174.57 (New High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Low volume pullback (Test) to $168.00 or a high volume break above $172.09.
- **Invalidation:** $164.50 (Break below the shakeout low)
---
### AVAV (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Down Thrust

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is Bullish, but the monthly sequence signals a Buying Climax (Watch for Test). Price was severely marked down after peaking near $408.25. The week of 1/19 showed a massive wide spread DOWN bar (Spread 90.04) on high volume (RelVol 1.44), closing poorly (CLV -0.82) - clear supply. The subsequent bars (1/26, 2/02) confirmed the markdown, with 2/02 being a very wide spread DOWN bar (Spread 53.45) on high volume (RelVol 1.49), closing poorly (CLV -0.13). Although the CLV improved slightly on 2/02, the sustained high volume and wide spread down movement confirms institutional distribution and a continuation of the markdown from the climax high.

**Key Levels:** 346.47 (Broken Support/Resistance), 276.76 (Immediate Resistance), 234.00 (Current Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A low volume reaction rally (LPSY) back towards the $280-$290 area.
- **Invalidation:** $321.04 (Above prior swing high)
---
### AXON (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Down Thrust

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is Bearish, and weekly Supply Dominance is noted. The week of 1/26 was a massive wide spread DOWN bar (Spread 134.73) on high volume (RelVol 1.31), closing extremely poorly (CLV -0.96). This is a strong down thrust, confirming institutional selling and breaking major support. The latest week (2/02) continued the markdown with a very wide spread DOWN bar (Spread 94.85) on extremely high volume (RelVol 2.29), closing poorly (CLV -0.62). This suggests panic selling and markdown continuation.

**Key Levels:** 481.35 (Broken Support/New Resistance), 396.41 (Current Low), 491.26 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A low volume reaction rally (LPSY) back towards the $450-$480 area.
- **Invalidation:** $595.54 (Above prior consolidation low)
---
### AXTA (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Demand Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is Bullish, and the monthly sequence signals confirmed Stopping Volume. The week of 1/26 showed supply entering (wide spread down, poor close, CLV -0.57). The latest week (2/02) delivered a wide spread UP bar (Spread 3.09) on high volume (RelVol 1.13) with a strong close (CLV 0.52). This indicates strong demand absorption, likely clearing weak hands during the pullback and confirming the underlying strength associated with the monthly Stopping Volume. The market appears ready for continuation.

**Key Levels:** 31.45 (Shakeout Low/Support), 34.50 (Immediate Resistance), 33.81 (Current Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A high volume break above $34.50.
- **Invalidation:** $32.79 (Below recent swing low)
---
### AXTI (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Change of Character

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is Bullish, and the monthly sequence signals a Buying Climax (Watch for Test), indicating recent high volatility and volume near the highs. The previous weeks showed classic distribution signs (1/12 and 1/19 wide spread down, poor closes, high volume). However, the latest week (2/02) delivered an extremely wide spread UP bar (Spread 7.64) on high volume (RelVol 1.90), closing near the high (CLV 0.97). This strong Change of Character suggests that the preceding distribution/weakness was actually a large shakeout/spring action, and demand has immediately overwhelmed supply. The market is likely entering a phase of strong continuation.

**Key Levels:** 16.50 (Spring Low/Support), 24.15 (New High/Immediate Resistance), 26.66 (Prior High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry on a low volume pullback (Test) to the $20-$22 area, or a clean break above $24.15.
- **Invalidation:** $17.01 (Below prior consolidation low)
---
### BABX (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Weakness Confirmed

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is Bearish, and the monthly sequence signals Supply Dominance (Watch for Test). The recent price action (1/12, 1/19) showed signs of a potential rally or test of supply near $53.35, characterized by wide UP spreads and high volume. However, the week of 1/26 provided a wide spread DOWN bar on high volume (RelVol 1.18), closing poorly (CLV -0.88) - an Effort No Result Down. The latest week (2/02) confirmed the weakness, showing an average spread DOWN bar on average volume, closing near the middle (CLV -0.12). The failure to rally and the resumption of poor closes confirm active supply dominating the market near the highs. Expect markdown continuation.

**Key Levels:** 46.36 (Broken Support/New Resistance), 39.71 (Current Low), 53.35 (Supply Zone)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A low volume rally back to test the $45.70 area (LPSY).
- **Invalidation:** $49.31 (Above previous swing high)
---
### BANC (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Demand Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is Bullish, but the monthly sequence confirms a strong Buying Climax. Price action was contained in a tight trading range ($19.67 - $21.09) from 1/12 to 1/26, suggesting quiet absorption or minor supply tests. The latest week (2/02) delivered a wide spread UP bar (Spread 1.53) on extremely high volume (RelVol 2.20), closing very strongly near the high (CLV 0.88). This strong demand confirmation clears the short-term resistance and suggests the earlier monthly climax was either a shakeout or reaccumulation, confirming the immediate bullish impulse.

**Key Levels:** 19.41 (Support), 20.94 (Immediate Resistance/Breakout Zone), 21.61 (Prior High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry on a low volume pullback (Test) to $20.00, or high volume follow-through above $20.94.
- **Invalidation:** $19.67 (Below the recent trading range low)
---
### BBIO (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Down Thrust

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is Bearish, and weekly Supply Dominance is noted. Selling pressure is persistent. The week of 1/26 showed average spread/volume and a poor close (CLV -0.30). The latest week (2/02) delivered a very wide spread DOWN bar (Spread 17.16) on extremely high volume (RelVol 1.98), closing poorly (CLV -0.39). This is a strong down thrust, confirming institutional distribution and markdown continuation. Although the volume might be climactic, the close is poor, supporting the bearish thesis. The high volume confirms the severity of the institutional selling.

**Key Levels:** 75.83 (Broken Support/New Resistance), 62.84 (Current Low), 80.00 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A low volume reaction rally (LPSY) back towards the $72-$74 area.
- **Invalidation:** $80.00 (Above the high of the recent down thrust)
---
### BBT (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Demand Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is Bullish, but the monthly sequence signals a Buying Climax (Watch for Test). The preceding weeks showed mild weakness (1/19 high volume, poor CLV -0.04; 1/26 high volume, poor CLV -0.07). However, the latest week (2/02) strongly negated this weakness, printing a wide spread UP bar (Spread 3.62) on very high volume (RelVol 1.51), closing near the high (CLV 0.87). This is a strong Change of Character and demand confirmation, suggesting the recent pullback was a successful shakeout. The market is ready to resume its bullish trend.

**Key Levels:** 28.18 (Support/Shakeout Low), 31.80 (New High/Immediate Resistance), 29.63 (Prior Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry on a low volume pullback (Test) to $30.00-$30.50, or a high volume push above $31.80.
- **Invalidation:** $28.18 (Below the shakeout low)
---
### BBVA (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Down Thrust

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is Bullish, but weekly Supply Dominance is noted. The week of 1/26 was an UP bar on high volume, closing poorly (CLV -0.15), suggesting supply absorption near the high $26.14. The latest week (2/02) confirmed strong supply entering the market with a massive wide spread DOWN bar (Spread 3.05) on extremely high volume (RelVol 2.85), closing poorly (CLV -0.38). This is a strong down thrust, signaling a severe Change of Character from the recent accumulation and breaking the lows of the prior consolidation range. This implies heavy institutional distribution.

**Key Levels:** 25.25 (Broken Support/New Resistance), 23.15 (Current Low), 26.14 (Prior High/Supply Zone)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A low volume rally (LPSY) back towards the $24.50-$25.00 area.
- **Invalidation:** $26.20 (Above the high of the recent down thrust)
---
### BBWI (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Demand Confirmation / No Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is Bullish, but the monthly sequence suggests Supply Dominance. The week of 1/19 saw a down bar on low volume (RelVol 0.46) with a poor close (CLV -0.13), hinting at a lack of demand or minor selling. However, the subsequent weeks showed strong recovery. The week of 1/26 was an UP bar on high volume, closing strongly (CLV 0.61). The latest week (2/02) confirmed this with a wide spread UP bar on high volume (RelVol 0.74), closing strongly (CLV 0.64). This sequence indicates that demand is fully in control, and the short-term pullback was successfully absorbed. The market is confirming bullish momentum.

**Key Levels:** 21.54 (Support), 23.38 (Immediate Resistance), 23.05 (Current Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $23.38 on high volume.
- **Invalidation:** $22.02 (Below the recent pivot low)
---
### BEP (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Demand Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is Bullish, but the monthly sequence signals confirmed Supply Dominance (Watch for Test). The week of 1/26 was a wide spread UP bar on high volume (RelVol 1.09) with a strong close (CLV 0.40). The latest week (2/02) confirmed the continuation of demand, showing an UP bar on average volume (RelVol 0.88) with a strong close (CLV 0.64). The market successfully absorbed the supply suggested by the monthly analysis and is now pushing higher. The volume profile is supportive of continued bullish momentum in the short term.

**Key Levels:** 29.33 (Support), 30.72 (Immediate Resistance), 28.21 (Prior Swing Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $30.72 on increased volume.
- **Invalidation:** $29.33 (Below the recent low)
---
### BFH (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Demand Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is Bullish, and weekly Stopping Volume is noted. The prior action (1/12 wide spread down, high volume) suggested a shakeout low. The latest week (2/02) confirmed strong demand, delivering a wide spread UP bar (Spread 8.13) on high volume (RelVol 1.50), closing near the high (CLV 0.90). This is a strong Change of Character and demand confirmation, aggressively pushing price out of the recent low consolidation and negating the potential short-term weakness seen on 1/19. The market is resuming its markup phase.

**Key Levels:** 71.80 (Shakeout Low/Support), 79.93 (New High/Immediate Resistance), 74.27 (Prior Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry on a low volume pullback (Test) to $75.00, or high volume follow-through above $79.93.
- **Invalidation:** $71.80 (Below the shakeout low)
---
### BKSY (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Selling Pressure/High Volume Reversal

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly sequence indicates a CONFIRMED_EARLY Buying Climax. The week of Jan 26 saw a wide down bar (Spread 6.5) closing near the low (CLV -0.91) on high volume (RelVol 0.89), signaling strong supply entering the market. The latest bar (Feb 2) attempted a rally, but despite having the highest relative volume (1.28), the close was mediocre (CLV 0.54), showing resistance near the open of the previous down week. This looks like a weak rally after heavy selling, confirming supply dominance.

**Key Levels:** Key Resistance: 28.30 (Jan 26 high), Immediate Support: 21.79 (Jan 26 low), Weekly Low (Feb 2): 19.32

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 19.32
- **Invalidation:** Close above 28.30
---
### BNS (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort to Rise (Successful Rally)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Despite being flagged for SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (Jan 26 showed high volume with a bearish close, CLV -0.58), the latest week (Feb 2) shows an aggressive push up. High volume (RelVol 1.28) on a wide spread bar closing very strongly near the high (CLV 0.88). This is significant effort leading to a successful result, overcoming the apparent supply from the previous week.

### BP (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance Failure / Effort to Rise (Success)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The ticker was flagged for SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (Jan 26, high volume, wide spread, positive close CLV 0.16—already suspicious). The latest week (Feb 2) validates the weakness of the prior supply signal: Very high volume (RelVol 1.51) on a wide spread bar, closing decisively near the high (CLV 0.54). This is strong DEMAND overwhelming any remaining supply. The price is pushing hard into new high territory, confirming the Quarterly BULLISH_TREND.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Support: 37.29 (Low of Feb 2), Recent High/Target: 39.51, Demand Zone: 36.46

#### Action Plan

### CALM (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax Reaction / Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The ticker is in a BULLISH_TREND but showing weakness. The last weekly bar (Feb 2) is a wide down bar closing near the low (CLV -0.93) on high volume (RelVol 1.22). This strong bearish result on high effort indicates heavy supply and successful distribution by Smart Money, potentially confirming the turn implied by the prior SUPPLY_DOMINANCE warning. This is a strong sign of weakness (Sign of Weakness, SOW).

**Key Levels:** High of Distribution: 89.48, Immediate Support: 82.28, SOW Low: 82.28

#### Action Plan

High volume (RelVol 2.74) on a wide up spread, closing extremely strong near the high (CLV 0.82). This is overwhelming demand, absorbing the prior supply and successfully rallying the price. This marks a Selling Climax (Jan 26 low) followed by a successful Automatic Rally.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Support: 44.70 (Low of AR), Target/Resistance: 57.32 (Jan 26 high), Accumulation Range: 44.70 - 53.98

### CBRL (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort to Rise (Success)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly sequence suggests a CONFIRMED_EARLY Supply Dominance, meaning the trend has likely topped or is reversing down. However, the last weekly bar (Feb 2) counters this narrative. High volume (RelVol 0.99) on a wide up spread, closing very strongly near the high (CLV 0.73). This is a strong effort with a successful result, indicating demand has returned aggressively, potentially negating the monthly bearish signal.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Support: 29.70, Resistance/Target: 34.43, Prior Supply Zone: 36.64

This is a successful immediate recovery/Automatic Rally following the intense shakeout/Selling Climax (Jan 26). Demand has clearly returned, suggesting the prior supply was a deep pullback before continuation.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Support: 19.08 (Low of AR), Resistance: 22.13, SC Low: 20.02

Following high volume distribution attempts (Jan 19, 26), the latest bar (Feb 2) shows high volume (RelVol 1.94) and a wide spread, closing strongly positive (CLV 0.56). This indicates strong demand stepping in, likely absorbing earlier supply and marking a successful effort to rise.

Extreme volume (RelVol 2.55) on a wide spread bar, closing strongly near the high (CLV 0.84). This is overwhelming demand. While such high volume at new highs is often a BC, the strong bullish close suggests this is a momentum move supported by Smart Money, continuing the BULLISH_TREND.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Support: 27.43, New High/Target: 30.94, Demand Zone: 28.85

#### Action Plan

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly chart flagged a Buying Climax previously, followed by reaction bars. The latest bar (Feb 2) shows extremely high volume (RelVol 2.26) on a wide up spread, closing positively (CLV 0.21). The high volume indicates strong demand, though the close is slightly compromised (not near the high). This suggests some supply absorption or a weak rally test, but overall, demand is dominating the high volume bar, suggesting a push higher in the BULLISH_TREND.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Support: 24.72, Resistance: 26.23, Monthly Low: 24.72

### CVS (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Effort to Rise (Success)

**Smart Money Logic:**
Jan 26 showed massive Supply Dominance (RelVol 2.33, wide spread, poor CLV -0.42). The latest bar (Feb 2) is a strong automatic rally: high volume (RelVol 1.34) on a wide up spread, closing very strongly near the high (CLV 0.78). This confirms the Jan 26 low (70.69) was a potential Selling Climax, and Smart Money is now accumulating and marking the price up. Strong demand is evident.

**Key Levels:** Climax Low: 70.69, Immediate Support: 74.36 (Open of AR), AR High/Target: 78.96

#### Action Plan

**VSA Status:** High Volume Up-Bar (Absorption/Strength)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar is a wide spread up, closing near the high (CLV 0.867) on high volume (RelVol 1.54). This is a strong sign of demand absorbing previous selling pressure, especially following the wide spread down bar on very high volume (RelVol 1.80) two weeks prior, which indicated Supply Dominance. The immediate strength suggests a potential reversal or successful shakeout after the initial supply reaction. The quarterly trend is BULLISH.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 35.00 (Weekly High), Support: 31.69 (Last weekly low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and sustain above 35.00.

### FHB (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** High Volume Up-Close (Absorption/Strength)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence is marked as SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (Watch for Test), but the latest weekly bar shows a strong response: an up-bar closing near the high (CLV 0.718) on high volume (RelVol 1.66). This volume/price action indicates strong demand overcoming recent supply pressures (the wide spread down bar two weeks prior on RelVol 1.96). This suggests the supply has been absorbed and the setup is turning bullish.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 27.43 (Weekly High), Support: 26.10 (Previous Supply Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and sustain above 27.43, ideally on increasing volume.

This aggressive move indicates significant demand entering the market, overcoming the previous week's weakness (down bar, high CLV -0.94). This immediate strength negates the recent supply signal, pushing the price back toward highs. Smart Money is aggressively buying.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 39.17 (Weekly High), Support: 35.60 (Last weekly low)

The monthly CLV is also extremely low, reinforcing bearishness.

This is a potential Upthrust After Distribution (UTAD) failure or a clear accumulation signal against the prevailing bearish trend. The immediate momentum is bullish.

The last weekly bar is a wide spread down (24.51 points), closing near the low (CLV -0.57) on massive, Ultra-High Volume (RelVol 2.95). This aggressive volume confirms intense selling and markdown acceleration, signaling a strong bearish continuation.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 117.25 (Weekly High), Support: 92.73 (Weekly Low)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BEARISH, and both weekly and monthly sequences are SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The last weekly bar is a wide spread down, closing near the low (CLV -0.59) on massive, Ultra-High Volume (RelVol 4.05). The extreme volume and strong negative close confirm an aggressive markdown and panic selling, reinforcing the overall bearish context.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 32.05 (Weekly High), Support: 26.50 (Weekly Low)

---
### MTCH (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Ultra-High Volume Up-Bar (Strength)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence is BUYING_CLIMAX (Watch for Test), operating within a BEARISH Quarterly Trend. However, the last weekly bar is a very wide spread up, closing in the upper half (CLV 0.228) on massive, Ultra-High Volume (RelVol 2.41). This volume indicates strong demand, potentially overcoming the prior distribution signals or initiating a significant reversal. This strength requires bullish follow-through.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 33.40 (Weekly High), Support: 28.81 (Weekly Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and sustain above 33.40.
- **Invalidation:** Below 28.81.
---
### NICE (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** High Volume Up-Close (Strength/Reversal)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly sequence is SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (Confirmed Early). However, the last weekly bar is a wide spread up, closing in the upper half (CLV 0.563) on high volume (RelVol 1.56). This strong bullish reaction follows a bar two weeks prior that showed extreme weakness (CLV -0.926). This suggests aggressive demand stepped in to absorb the supply, indicating a potential short-term reversal against the BEARISH Quarterly Trend.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 113.85 (Weekly High), Support: 104.73 (Weekly Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and sustain above 113.85.
- **Invalidation:** Below 104.73.
---
### NXPI (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Ultra-High Volume Up-Bar (Stopping Volume)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence is STOPPING_VOLUME (Watch for Test). The last weekly bar is a wide spread up, closing in the upper range (CLV 0.278) on Ultra-High Volume (RelVol 2.19). Although the close isn't on the high, the massive volume following a series of weak bars (CLV -0.85 last week) suggests this is significant demand entering the market, halting the previous decline. This is a strong sign of accumulation within the BULLISH Quarterly Trend.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 234.09 (Weekly High), Support: 207.01 (Weekly Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and sustain above 234.09.
- **Invalidation:** Below 207.01.
---
### OC (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** High Volume Up-Close (Strength/Markup)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly sequence is STOPPING_VOLUME (Confirmed Early). The last weekly bar is a wide spread up, closing near the high (CLV 0.889) on high volume (RelVol 1.61). This aggressive strength confirms the underlying accumulation indicated by the monthly stopping volume. This looks like a clear markup phase beginning, supported by the BULLISH Quarterly Trend.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 136.71 (Weekly High), Support: 119.16 (Weekly Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and sustain above 136.71.
- **Invalidation:** Below 119.16.
---
### OMF (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Ultra-High Volume Down-Close (Panic Selling/Distribution)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BEARISH, and the weekly sequence is SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The last weekly bar is a wide spread down, closing near the low (CLV -0.635) on Ultra-High Volume (RelVol 2.21). This is strong confirmation of supply dominance and aggressive markdown, following several weeks where the price struggled to make upward progress. Selling pressure is intense.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 66.26 (Weekly High), Support: 60.61 (Weekly Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 60.61 for continuation short.
- **Invalidation:** Above 65.35 (Last weekly open).
---
### OZK (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Exhaustion/Potential Shakeout

**Smart Money Logic:**
OZK experienced strong selling (Supply Dominance detected) ending 1/19 (CLV -0.913) but recovered sharply. The last weekly bar shows High Volume (RelVol 1.18) on a wide spread, closing near the high (CLV 0.986). This looks like a shakeout low (1/19 volume spike) followed by strong Buying on the last bar, indicating demand aggressively took control. The monthly CLV (0.986) also confirms aggressive buying to end the period.

**Key Levels:** 45.77 (Shakeout Low/Support), 51.43 (Recent High/Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Sustained break above 51.43.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 46.99 (last weekly low).
---
### PB (NEUTRAL/BULLISH Watch)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume/Upthrust

**Smart Money Logic:**
The week of 1/26 showed Ultra High Volume (RelVol 2.38) and a very wide spread, closing near the middle/low (CLV -0.04), which acted as Stopping Volume after a sharp decline. The last bar is a massive bullish reversal (Wide spread 6.75, Ultra High Volume RelVol 2.08, CLV 0.908), indicating intense demand absorbed all remaining supply, pushing the price strongly to the close. This confirms an immediate institutional response (spring/reversal) off key support (65.12).

**Key Levels:** 65.12 (Support/Spring Low), 74.81 (Recent High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Pullback and successful low-volume test of the 72-73 area, or a break above 74.81.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 68.06.
---
### PSN (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Absorbed Supply (Strength Confirmation)

**Smart Money Logic:**
PSN is in a Quarterly BULLISH trend. The last weekly bar shows below-average volume (RelVol 0.87) and a narrow spread, closing near the high (CLV 0.618). This action, following the previous week's supply dominance (CLV -0.57), suggests that the prior supply has been absorbed, and demand is now easily pushing the price up on lower effort. This is a low-volume test or sign of strength after a shakeout.

**Key Levels:** 67.11 (Recent Low/Support), 73.26 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 73.26 (or 74.62) on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 67.11.
---
### RF (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Strong Demand/No Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
RF is in a Quarterly BULLISH trend. The last bar showed high volume (RelVol 0.90) and a wide spread, closing near the high (CLV 0.829). This is a classic Sign of Strength, indicating strong institutional demand pushing the price up easily. Following the rally the week prior (CLV 0.76), this suggests the correction phase is over and the markup phase is resuming.

**Key Levels:** 28.36 (Recent Support/Low), 31.17 (New High/Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Entry on a minor pullback (No Supply) toward 30.50, targeting a breakout of 31.17.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 28.36.
---
### RGTI (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Demand Confirmation (Stopping Volume Follow-through)

**Smart Money Logic:**
RGTI is in a BEARISH Quarterly trend, but the last bar shows strong demand action. After significant selling the previous week (CLV -0.82), the last bar reversed sharply on High Volume (RelVol 0.67), closing near the high (CLV 0.622). This volume spike and strong close confirm institutional interest (Stopping Volume/Spring) absorbing the previous markdown.

**Key Levels:** 14.82 (Spring/Climax Low), 18.37 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 18.37 on increased volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 14.82.
---
### RLI (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Demand Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
Despite the BEARISH Quarterly trend and Monthly Supply Dominance, the last bar shows strong demand. High Volume (RelVol 1.09) on a wide spread closed strongly near the high (CLV 0.542). This bullish action followed a week of supply (CLV 0.196), indicating institutional demand has successfully absorbed supply and is pushing the price into a markup phase, challenging the immediate bearish structure.

**Key Levels:** 58.15 (Recent Low/Support), 62.77 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 62.77 on strong volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 58.15.
---
### SA (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Reversal Confirmation)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart shows CONFIRMED_EARLY SUPPLY_DOMINANCE, but the last two weeks contradict this. After a massive distribution/climax bar on 1/26 (CLV -0.97), the last bar showed High Volume (RelVol 1.15) and a wide spread, closing strongly in the upper half (CLV 0.55). This strong reversal action suggests institutional buying has stepped in off the low (27.40), absorbing the previous distribution/panic selling and initiating a markdown recovery.

**Key Levels:** 27.40 (Spring Low/Support), 30.75 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 30.75 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 27.40.
---
### SYF (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Demand Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
Despite the BEARISH Quarterly trend, the last bar shows strong demand stepping in. Following weeks of supply dominance (CLVs around -0.7), the last bar was high volume (RelVol 1.31) on a wide spread, closing strongly near the high (CLV 0.629). This bar reversed the prior weakness, confirming institutional absorption and potentially marking a spring off the lows (72.22).

**Key Levels:** 72.22 (Spring Low/Support), 77.26 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 77.26 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 72.22.
---
### TFX (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Demand Confirmation/No Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH, but the last bar shows a significant change of character. After multiple weeks of Supply Dominance (CLVs around -0.5 to -0.9), the last bar printed high volume (RelVol 1.74) on a wide spread, closing strongly near the high (CLV 0.854). This high-effort, high-result bar suggests strong institutional demand absorbed the remaining supply and initiated a powerful rally.

**Key Levels:** 101.65 (Recent Support), 108.94 (Immediate Resistance/High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and sustain above 108.94.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 101.65.
---
### TXT (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Demand Confirmation/No Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
Despite the Quarterly BULLISH trend, TXT experienced recent distribution. However, the last weekly bar showed High Volume (RelVol 1.81) on a wide spread, closing near the high (CLV 0.909). This is a strong Sign of Strength, confirming that institutional demand absorbed the prior week's severe selling (CLV -0.34) and is now aggressively pushing the price back up. This suggests the prior weakness was only a shakeout.

**Key Levels:** 86.36 (Shakeout Low/Support), 95.87 (Recent High/Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and sustain above 95.87.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 86.36.
---
### USIG (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Demand Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
USIG is in a BULLISH trend. The last bar had High Volume (RelVol 1.44) on a narrow spread, closing near the high (CLV 0.933). This is a clear Sign of Strength/No Supply, indicating institutional demand is easily pushing the price higher. This confirms the accumulation detected in the previous month (CLV 0.319).

**Key Levels:** 51.63 (Recent Support), 51.93 (New High/Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Sustained break above 51.93 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 51.63.
---
### WHR (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Demand Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
WHR is in a BULLISH Quarterly trend. After a shakeout bar on 1/26 (CLV 0.119 on Ultra High Volume), the last bar showed High Volume (RelVol 1.44) and a wide spread, closing strongly in the upper half (CLV 0.585). This confirms that demand successfully absorbed the volume from the shakeout bar and has initiated a strong rally, potentially leading to a markup phase.

**Key Levels:** 77.61 (Shakeout Low/Support), 88.84 (Recent High/Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 88.84 on increasing volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 77.61.
---
## 👀 Watch/Monitoring
### ABT (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** No Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly trend is bearish, but recent weekly activity shows signs of absorption. The last two weeks printed wide spread UP bars on high/very high relative volume (RelVol 2.37, 1.94), with high CLV (0.57, 0.90). This indicates aggressive buying absorbing the prior heavy supply from the 1/19 week (Spread 16.7, RelVol 2.57, CLV -0.80). The high volume spike suggests a stopping action near the low 105.78, followed by a strong recovery. The latest weekly bar is a strong close (CLV 0.90) on significant volume, suggesting no readily available supply (No Supply test imminent).

**Key Levels:** 105.78 (Stopping Volume/Support), 111.06 (Recent High/Resistance), 121.88 (Prior Low Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A low volume 'Test' or 'No Supply' sign that holds above $109.00.
- **Invalidation:** $105.77 (Below the recent major low)
---
### ACLX (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is bullish, but the monthly sequence is suggesting Supply Dominance (Watch for Test). The week of 1/19 showed a very wide spread bar (Spread 10.5) on very high volume (RelVol 1.51), but the close was near the low (CLV -0.67), indicating significant selling absorbing the effort to push price higher (Effort No Result). The next two weeks showed mixed action: 1/26 (narrow spread, average volume, CLV 0.11) and 2/02 (wider spread, average volume, CLV -0.33). The high volume spike followed by weak closes confirms supply is active near $76.50. Currently sitting in a trading range between $66.44 and $71.25.

**Key Levels:** 66.00 (Recent Support), 71.25 (Immediate Resistance), 76.50 (Major Supply Zone)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Breakout above $71.25 on high volume for bullish continuation, or break below $66.00 for weakness confirmation.
- **Invalidation:** N/A (Pending break of range)
---
### ACWX (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Supply Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is Bullish, but a weekly Buying Climax is signaled (Watch for Test). The week of 1/26 showed a wide spread UP bar (Spread 1.84) on high volume (RelVol 1.91), but the close was weak (CLV -0.68), potentially indicating supply absorption near the $72.33 high. This is an Effort No Result Up bar. The latest week (2/02) showed high volume (RelVol 1.57) and a strong close (CLV 0.97), covering the spread of the prior weak bar. This suggests the market quickly overcame the supply test, but the recent high volume weakness needs confirmation. It looks like a shakeout and quick recovery, typical of strong market behavior, but caution is needed near the high ($72.33).

**Key Levels:** 70.30 (Recent Support), 72.33 (Buying Climax High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A clean break and successful retest of $72.33.
- **Invalidation:** $70.30 (Failure of recent support)
---
### AEVA (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Selling Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
The trend is heavily bearish, indicated by the Quarterly/Monthly sequences. The weeks leading up to 1/26 showed heavy supply, culminating in a Down bar on high volume closing near the low (1/19: CLV -0.98). The 1/26 bar had slightly less volume but maintained the downtrend (CLV -0.83). However, the latest week (2/02) had lower spread and high volume (RelVol 0.93) but managed a close near the middle/top (CLV 0.02) despite the wide range. This high volume, low result to the downside (Selling Climax potential) suggests professional interest might be entering, slowing the markdown. Caution is advised, but signs of absorption are present at the lows.

**Key Levels:** 12.30 (Immediate Support), 11.18 (Current Low/Climax bottom), 15.81 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a definitive low volume Test and subsequent high volume UP bar confirmation above $13.56.
- **Invalidation:** $11.18 (Below the Selling Climax low)
---
### AGIO (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax / Monthly Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is bearish, but the monthly sequence shows confirmed Stopping Volume. However, the last two weekly bars show conflicting signals. 1/26 was a down bar, wide spread, poor close (CLV -0.67) on average volume. The latest week (2/02) was also a down bar, average spread, closing very poorly (CLV -0.92) but on higher volume (RelVol 0.95). The very poor close suggests that the attempt to stop the decline (Monthly SV) is being immediately met with renewed selling pressure in the short term. The volume, while high, is not climactic enough to confirm a definitive Selling Climax, keeping the status neutral as we await confirmation of the monthly reversal effort.

**Key Levels:** 26.45 (Recent Low/Support), 27.18 (Immediate Resistance), 28.71 (Prior Swing High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Clear break and hold above $27.50 on increased volume for bullish confirmation, or break below $26.45 for short continuation.
- **Invalidation:** N/A (Pending further reaction)
---
### AHR (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Selling Pressure

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is Bullish, but a weekly Buying Climax is noted (Watch for Test). The week of 1/26 saw very high volume (RelVol 3.99) on a wide spread bar (Spread 2.66), but the close was near the mid-point (CLV 0.15). This massive volume spike without a corresponding strong close suggests heavy supply entering the market (Stopping Volume/Climax). The latest week (2/02) was a high volume UP bar (RelVol 1.59) with a strong close (CLV 0.56), showing a quick rebound. This could be a reaction after the climactic high volume test, but given the preceding massive volume on 1/26, the area near $48.00-$49.50 is heavy with supply. Neutral until supply is cleared.

**Key Levels:** 45.37 (Recent Support), 49.52 (Immediate Resistance/Climax High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A low volume pullback (Test) to $46.50, or high volume move above $49.52.
- **Invalidation:** $45.37 (Below the reaction low)
---
### AIG (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Change of Character (Short Term)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The long-term trend is bearish, and weekly Supply Dominance was confirmed (1/05 and 1/12 showing heavy supply). However, the last two weeks show a potential short-term Change of Character. The week of 1/26 was an UP bar on average volume, closing strongly (CLV 0.96), suggesting absorption of sellers. The latest week (2/02) confirmed this strength with a wide spread UP bar on high volume (RelVol 1.02), also closing strongly (CLV 0.60). This indicates short-term strength and a successful rebound from the 71.25 support, likely aiming to test the prior distribution highs. While the monthly context is still weak, the recent strength warrants a neutral assessment pending further range development.

**Key Levels:** 71.25 (Major Support), 77.52 (Immediate Resistance), 85.69 (Prior High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Sustained volume pushing price above $77.52.
- **Invalidation:** $72.11 (Below recent swing low)
---
### AIQ (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Effort No Result Down

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is bearish, but the monthly sequence suggests a Buying Climax (Watch for Test). The last three weeks have seen narrow to average spread bars on average volume, consolidating near the $52-$53 resistance zone. The week of 1/26 was an Effort No Result Down (wide spread, low close, CLV -0.80) on low volume (RelVol 0.72), indicating weak selling. The latest week (2/02) had high volume (RelVol 1.19) and a very wide range, but closed poorly (CLV -0.19), suggesting increased supply is still present in the area, or that professional selling is testing the ability of the market to sustain lower prices (Effort Down, Poor Result). The market is currently consolidating after the recent high volume bar.

**Key Levels:** 48.28 (Support Low), 52.72 (Immediate Resistance), 53.94 (Monthly Climax High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Confirmation of absorption near $48.28 with a low volume Test followed by an aggressive UP bar.
- **Invalidation:** $48.28 (Break below current consolidation low)
---
### ALC (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Reaction Rally

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is Bullish, and the monthly sequence signals confirmed Stopping Volume, indicating potential accumulation or a major shakeout has occurred. The week of 2/02 printed a high volume bar (RelVol 1.53), but managed to close well off the lows (CLV 0.17), indicating strong buying interest at $76.95, effectively stopping the short-term decline. This suggests the market is reacting positively to the earlier monthly Stopping Volume. The close near the middle shows absorption of supply above the accumulation area.

**Key Levels:** 76.95 (Stopping Volume Low/Support), 80.15 (Immediate Resistance), 82.50 (Prior High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A clear Test of the recent low (or the weekly open $79.65) on low volume, followed by a break above $80.15.
- **Invalidation:** $76.95 (Break below Stopping Volume low)
---
### ALL (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Change of Character (Short Term)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is Bullish, but weekly Supply Dominance was confirmed (1/12 wide spread down, very high volume, CLV -0.94). The subsequent two weeks showed mild absorption/consolidation near $192 support. The latest week (2/02) delivered a very wide spread UP bar (Spread 18.53) on very high volume (RelVol 1.72), but the close was near the middle (CLV 0.007). This is an Effort No Result Up bar, suggesting significant professional selling entered near the highs ($216.75) despite the strong buying effort. The battle between the long-term bullish trend and short-term distribution is raging near the top of the recent range. Neutral pending resolution.

**Key Levels:** 191.13 (Major Support/Initial Climax Low), 216.75 (Resistance/Top of Range)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for confirmation below $198.22 for markdown, or decisive break above $216.75 for continuation.
- **Invalidation:** N/A (Pending break of range)
---
### AMBA (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Effort vs. Result

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is Bearish, and Supply Dominance is noted. The recent selling sequence (1/05, 1/26) was characterized by wide spread down bars and poor closes. The latest week (2/02) saw an average spread UP bar on high volume (RelVol 1.16) closing in the upper half (CLV 0.44). This strong CLV suggests short-term buying strength and absorption, potentially marking a short-term shakeout low at $58.58. However, given the strong preceding bearish bars, this bounce needs confirmation. We are currently in a Trading Range where supply has been dominant, but a positive reaction bar has appeared.

**Key Levels:** 58.58 (Immediate Support/Shakeout Low), 65.57 (Immediate Resistance), 70.77 (Prior Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Low volume pullback to $60-$62 followed by a move above $65.57.
- **Invalidation:** $58.58 (Break below recent low)
---
### AMH (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Change of Character

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is bearish, but monthly Stopping Volume is confirmed. The weekly sequence confirms this Stopping Volume action (Watch for Test). The last two weeks (1/26 and 2/02) were weak, showing high volume but bars closing mostly in the middle/low. Specifically, 2/02 had high volume (RelVol 1.40) but a narrow spread, closing neutrally (CLV 0.01). This suggests that high selling effort yielded very little result (Effort No Result Down), characteristic of professional absorption or accumulation efforts within a markdown. Given the confirmed monthly SV, a neutral status is warranted as the market tries to turn the corner, but supply is still present.

**Key Levels:** 30.13 (Stopping Volume Low/Support), 32.45 (Resistance), 30.84 (Current Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a successful low volume Test below $30.84 and a subsequent high volume push above $31.53.
- **Invalidation:** $30.13 (Below the Stopping Volume low)
---
### AMSC (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Effort vs. Result

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is Bearish, but weekly Stopping Volume is noted. The selling accelerated on 2/02 with a very wide spread DOWN bar (Spread 6.97) on extremely high volume (RelVol 2.22). Crucially, despite the massive effort (volume) to drive price down, the close was significantly off the low (CLV -0.05). This is a classic Selling Climax or Effort No Result Down, indicating professional buying absorption at the $24.87 low. This high volume, poor result to the downside marks a potential change in trend, but requires further confirmation of accumulation.

**Key Levels:** 24.87 (Selling Climax Low/Support), 29.67 (Immediate Resistance), 34.50 (Prior High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a definitive low volume 'Test' of the $24.87 area, or a high volume push above $31.85.
- **Invalidation:** $24.87 (Break below the climax low)
---
### APH (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Change of Character

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is Bullish, but weekly Stopping Volume is noted. The prior two weeks (1/19, 1/26) showed conflicting signals: 1/26 was a massive volume spike (RelVol 2.28) on a very wide spread DOWN bar, closing near the low (CLV -0.69). This is a potential Selling Climax, indicating heavy selling met by strong absorption. The latest week (2/02) continued the wide range (Spread 23.03) and high volume (RelVol 1.92), but the close was significantly off the low (CLV -0.12). This further supports the idea that the heavy selling has been absorbed (Stopping Volume/Shakeout), and a bottom is likely forming. Neutral pending confirmation of upward follow-through.

**Key Levels:** 126.21 (Selling Climax Low/Support), 149.24 (Immediate Resistance), 167.04 (Prior High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A low volume 'Test' back to $130-$132, followed by a move above $149.24.
- **Invalidation:** $126.21 (Break below the Stopping Volume low)
---
### APLS (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Demand Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is Bearish, but a weekly Buying Climax is noted. The strong rejection bar on 1/12 (wide spread down, high volume, CLV -0.94) signaled major weakness. Subsequent weeks saw consolidation and average volume. The latest bar (2/02) was an UP bar on average volume (RelVol 1.01) with a high close (CLV 0.51). This suggests the market is recovering from the prior weakness, challenging the notion of a firm Buying Climax. The close in the upper half indicates short-term demand is strong. Given the conflicting signals (bearish quarterly trend vs. recent bullish bar), we maintain a neutral status within the current range.

**Key Levels:** 19.76 (Support), 24.10 (Immediate Resistance), 27.46 (Prior High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $24.10 on high volume for short-term bullish continuation.
- **Invalidation:** $21.10 (Break below recent consolidation low)
---
### APO (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Change of Character

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is Bearish, but weekly Stopping Volume is noted. The price has been steadily declining. The latest week (2/02) saw an extremely high volume spike (RelVol 2.17) on a wide range bar (Spread 14.52). Crucially, despite this heavy selling volume, the close was off the low (CLV 0.51). This high volume/high CLV indicates a massive professional absorption effort (Selling Climax/Stopping Volume). This suggests the immediate markdown may be over, and an accumulation phase is starting. Neutral pending confirmation of demand follow-through.

**Key Levels:** 122.06 (Selling Climax Low/Support), 136.58 (Immediate Resistance), 142.61 (Prior Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A low volume 'Test' of $125-$128, followed by a break above $137.00.
- **Invalidation:** $122.06 (Break below the climax low)
---
### ARCC (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Selling Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is Bearish, and weekly Stopping Volume is noted. The market has been consolidating in a tight range. The week of 1/26 showed a down bar (Spread 0.87) on high volume (RelVol 1.16), closing near the low (CLV -0.95), suggesting weakness. However, the latest week (2/02) saw an extremely high volume spike (RelVol 2.23) on a wide spread bar (Spread 1.13), closing off the low (CLV -0.02). This is a Selling Climax/Shakeout bar, where aggressive institutional selling was met by immediate absorption, marking a potential low at $18.76. Neutral pending confirmation of demand.

**Key Levels:** 18.76 (Selling Climax Low/Support), 19.89 (Immediate Resistance), 20.40 (Prior Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A low volume 'Test' of $18.76 - $19.00, followed by a move above $19.89.
- **Invalidation:** $18.76 (Break below the climax low)
---
### ARWR (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Selling Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is Bearish, and weekly Supply Dominance is noted. The week of 2/02 showed a massive volume spike (RelVol 4.10) on a wide spread DOWN bar (Spread 12.65), closing poorly (CLV -0.83). This high volume, closing near the low, signals a powerful Selling Climax/Shakeout event, where the market is absorbing tremendous selling pressure. This suggests the markdown may be culminating, but the close being so poor keeps us neutral until a definitive demand response is seen.

**Key Levels:** 63.46 (Selling Climax Low/Support), 76.11 (Immediate Resistance/Climax High), 64.52 (Current Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Wait for a successful low volume 'Test' of $63.46, followed by a move above $68.51.
- **Invalidation:** $63.46 (Break below the climax low)
---
### AS (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Demand Confirmation (Short Term)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is Bullish, but the monthly sequence signals confirmed Supply Dominance. The week of 1/26 was a down bar (Spread 2.54) on average volume, closing poorly (CLV -0.78), confirming supply presence. However, the latest week (2/02) delivered a wide spread UP bar (Spread 3.38) on high volume (RelVol 1.26), closing strongly (CLV 0.58). This is a strong Change of Character bar, confirming that demand is present and has absorbed the recent supply. This sets up a potential reaccumulation phase. Neutral status reflects the battle between the long-term bullish trend and the recent monthly supply dominance.

**Key Levels:** 34.82 (Support), 38.21 (Immediate Resistance), 38.91 (Prior High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above $38.91 on volume, or a low volume Test of $36.60.
- **Invalidation:** $36.36 (Below recent swing low)
---
### ASML (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Effort No Result Down

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is Bullish, and a weekly Buying Climax is noted (Watch for Test). The week of 1/26 saw extremely high volume (RelVol 1.96) on a wide spread UP bar (Spread 108.31), but the close was poor (CLV -0.30), indicating strong supply entering the market (Effort No Result Up). The latest week (2/02) was a very wide spread bar (Spread 137.10) on high volume (RelVol 1.51), closing above the middle (CLV 0.41). This volatility confirms a major battle. The latest bar suggests a successful shakeout of the weak holders following the ENoR Up, but supply remains active near the $1493 high. Neutral pending consolidation/resolution.

**Key Levels:** 1316.06 (Shakeout Low/Support), 1453.16 (Immediate Resistance), 1493.48 (Climax High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A definitive move above $1493.48 on extreme volume.
- **Invalidation:** $1316.06 (Break below the recent low)
---
### AVGX (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Demand Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is Bearish, and weekly Stopping Volume is noted. The selling accelerated on 1/19 (wide spread down, high volume, poor CLV -0.64). The latest week (2/02) showed a very wide spread bar (Spread 10.77) on high volume (RelVol 1.88), closing strongly off the low (CLV 0.65). This is a strong Change of Character/Stopping Volume action, indicating professional absorption of supply near $33.07. The market is reversing the short-term decline aggressively. Neutral status given the bearish long-term context versus the strong immediate demand response.

**Key Levels:** 33.07 (Stopping Volume Low/Support), 43.85 (Immediate Resistance), 49.16 (Prior High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A low volume pullback (Test) to $38-$40, followed by a high volume break above $43.85.
- **Invalidation:** $33.07 (Break below the Stopping Volume low)
---
### BAH (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Selling Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is Bullish, but the monthly sequence confirms a Buying Climax. The week of 1/26 delivered a massive wide spread DOWN bar (Spread 15.80) on extremely high volume (RelVol 1.72), closing poorly (CLV -0.84). This is a strong reaction after the January high, confirming a major Selling Wave. The latest week (2/02) was a wide spread bar (Spread 8.30) on high volume (RelVol 1.09), but closed strongly off the lows (CLV 0.89). This is a Selling Climax/Shakeout action, successfully testing the recent lows and indicating strong buying absorption. Neutral status reflects the transition from climax/distribution to accumulation/recovery.

**Key Levels:** 81.15 (Selling Climax Low/Support), 89.46 (Immediate Resistance), 109.10 (Climax High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A clean break and high volume follow-through above $89.46.
- **Invalidation:** $81.15 (Break below the shakeout low)
---
### BAM (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Demand Confirmation

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is Bearish, and weekly Stopping Volume is noted. The recent selling (1/26 wide spread down, high volume, poor CLV -0.79) was aggressively met by buying. The latest week (2/02) showed extremely high volume (RelVol 2.42) on a wide range bar, closing off the low (CLV 0.38). This is strong absorption, confirming a potential Selling Climax/Shakeout near $46.76, aligning with the Stopping Volume signal. The market is attempting to transition from markdown to accumulation. Neutral given the preceding bearish trend.

**Key Levels:** 46.76 (Selling Climax Low/Support), 50.87 (Immediate Resistance), 52.21 (Prior High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A low volume Test of $47-$48, followed by a high volume break above $50.87.
- **Invalidation:** $46.76 (Break below the climax low)
---
### BCE (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Change of Character

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is Bullish, but weekly Supply Dominance is noted. The price has been steadily increasing, characterized by strong UP bars (1/19, 1/26). However, the latest week (2/02) delivered a strong Change of Character to the downside. The bar was wide spread DOWN (Spread 1.52) on extremely high volume (RelVol 2.22), closing poorly (CLV -0.85). This is a strong signal of institutional supply entering the market, potentially marking a short-term reversal or the start of a distribution phase near the highs. Neutral status pending confirmation of follow-through weakness.

**Key Levels:** 24.97 (Immediate Support), 26.49 (Climax High/Resistance), 25.08 (Current Close)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Confirmation of weakness with a break below $24.97 on high volume.
- **Invalidation:** $26.49 (Above the climax high)
---
### BE (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Effort No Result Down

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is Bullish, and the monthly sequence signals confirmed Stopping Volume, indicating strong potential for accumulation. The volatility has been extremely high. The latest week (2/02) printed a very wide spread DOWN bar (Spread 44.83) on institutional, high volume (RelVol 1.39). Despite the major selling effort, the close was off the low (CLV -0.49). This is a potential Selling Climax or Effort No Result Down, where institutional buying absorbed the selling pressure. Neutral status reflects the transition from volatility and selling to potential accumulation, following the prior massive markup.

**Key Levels:** 131.66 (Selling Climax Low/Support), 151.37 (Immediate Resistance), 176.49 (Climax High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A low volume 'Test' of $135-$140, followed by a high volume break above $151.37.
- **Invalidation:** $131.66 (Break below the climax low)
---
### BHP (NEUTRAL/BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Selling Climax Reaction

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly chart showed a clear Buying Climax (BC) in the week of Jan 26 (high volume, wide spread, close near the low). The subsequent week (Feb 2) was a reaction, with very high volume (RelVol 1.65) and a wide spread, but the price closed poorly (CLV -0.61). This indicates significant distribution by Smart Money during this reaction phase, failing to rally convincingly after the BC. Quarterly trend is bullish, but the recent weekly structure suggests weakness entering the market.

**Key Levels:** BC High: 74.98, Support/Low of Reaction: 68.69, Monthly Open (Feb): 69.28

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 68.69 (Confirmation of Distribution)
- **Invalidation:** Close above 74.98 (Failure of BC)
---
### BKKT (NEUTRAL/BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Automatic Reaction/Weak Rally after Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly chart indicates a Buying Climax (BC) confirmed earlier in January (Week 1 and 2 showed extreme bullishness followed by reversal). The recent weekly bars (Jan 19, Jan 26, Feb 2) show weak closes (-0.72, -0.66, 0.29) on high volume followed by shrinking volume (RelVol 0.69) for the latest bar. The low CLV on the latest bar, despite the price increase, suggests supply is still present near the highs of the week. The high volume spikes earlier (Jan 5 & 12) coupled with the subsequent price weakness indicates Smart Money distribution.

**Key Levels:** BC High: 22.11, Immediate Support: 11.99, Monthly Low (Feb): 9.89

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 9.89 (Further Markdown)
- **Invalidation:** Close above 22.11 (Resumption of Uptrend)
---
### BL (NEUTRAL/BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
The ticker is in a BEARISH_TREND, and the weekly sequence shows SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (Jan 26: wide spread, low close, high volume, CLV -0.81). The last week (Feb 2) is flagged as STOPPING_VOLUME. This bar has very high relative volume (1.94) and a wide spread, but the CLV is only slightly negative (-0.27), indicating significant buying absorbed the supply, creating a tail near the low. This high volume suggests a potential transfer of shares (Stop Selling/Preliminary Support) after the recent markdown. Needs confirmation.

**Key Levels:** Stopping Volume Low: 41.56, Resistance from Prior Supply: 54.81, Monthly Open (Feb): 46.47

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 47.85 on increasing demand (A Test or Rally)
- **Invalidation:** Close below 41.56
---
### BLSH (NEUTRAL/BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
The ticker is in a strong BEARISH_TREND, marked by Supply Dominance in Jan 26 (high volume, wide spread, low close, CLV -0.91). The latest weekly bar (Feb 2) exhibits extreme volume (RelVol 1.99) and a wide spread, but the CLV is near the midpoint (-0.048). This extreme effort with a poor bearish result strongly suggests Stopping Volume—Smart Money absorbing the intense selling pressure. This marks a potential Preliminary Support/Selling Climax area.

**Key Levels:** Stopping Volume Low: 24.79, Immediate Resistance: 30.38 (High of SV week), Supply Line (Jan 26 open): 35.45

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A subsequent Test on low volume or a strong rally above 30.38
- **Invalidation:** Close below 24.79
---
### BN (NEUTRAL/BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
Following a Supply Dominance week (Jan 26: high volume, low close, CLV -0.74), the latest weekly bar (Feb 2) shows high volume (RelVol 1.96) and a wide spread, closing near the middle (-0.13 CLV). This suggests Stopping Volume, where Smart Money absorbs the selling at a potential major support level. The lack of a decisive close near the low indicates that the massive supply encountered matching demand.

**Key Levels:** Stopping Volume Low: 43.99, Resistance: 47.85 (High of Jan 26), Monthly Low: 43.99

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 46.80 (High of Feb 2) with conviction
- **Invalidation:** Close below 43.99
---
### BOX (NEUTRAL/BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
In a BEARISH_TREND, the weeks of Jan 12 and Jan 26 showed intense supply (high volume, wide spread, low closes). The latest bar (Feb 2) is flagged as STOPPING_VOLUME. It shows exceptional volume (RelVol 1.92) and a wide spread, but the CLV is only -0.11, meaning the price closed near the open/midpoint, despite the wide range. This high volume, failing to push the price decisively lower, suggests Smart Money absorbed selling, marking potential Preliminary Support (PS).

**Key Levels:** Stopping Volume Low (PS): 23.70, Immediate Resistance: 25.88, Prior Swing Low (Jan 26): 25.15

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Confirmation via a low volume Test followed by a break above 25.88
- **Invalidation:** Close below 23.70
---
### BRBR (BEARISH (Short-term Reaction Likely))
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax/Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly chart flagged STOPPING_VOLUME (CONFIRMED_EARLY) in February, but the weekly bar (Feb 2) itself is a massive markdown effort. Extreme volume (RelVol 2.07) on a wide spread bar, closing decisively near the low (CLV -0.94). This is an intense Selling Climax or final liquidation phase. While the monthly context suggests potential reversal, the immediate weekly action is overwhelmingly bearish, signaling continued short-term supply dominance until a proper shakeout occurs. This bar looks like a Selling Climax requiring an immediate Automatic Rally.

**Key Levels:** Climax Low: 19.35, Immediate Resistance: 25.06 (Open of SC week), Monthly Low: 19.35

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short: Break below 19.35. Long: Entry only after a clear Automatic Rally and successful Test.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 25.06
---
### BROS (NEUTRAL/BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
Jan 26 showed strong Supply Dominance (RelVol 2.48, CLV -0.74, wide spread). The latest bar (Feb 2) has high volume (RelVol 1.67) and a wide spread, but crucially, it closed extremely high (CLV 0.96). This is a textbook response to a large selling event—demand stepped in forcefully at the lows (51.76) and pushed the price back up, marking Stopping Volume/Preliminary Support. This action contradicts the previous supply signal and suggests accumulation is occurring in this zone.

**Key Levels:** Stopping Volume Low (PS): 51.76, Immediate Resistance/Rally High: 57.14, Prior Supply Zone: 62.88

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 57.14 on demand, or test of 54.00 on low volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 51.76
---
### BRZE (BEARISH (Short-term Climax))
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Selling Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
The ticker is in a strong BEARISH_TREND, confirmed by multiple Supply Dominance weeks, culminating in a violent down bar on Feb 2. The latest bar has massive volume (RelVol 2.49) and a wide spread, closing near the low (CLV -0.78). This is either a strong continuation of distribution or a Selling Climax. Given the volume spike and the low close, immediate short positions are high risk due to potential Automatic Rally, but the sustained trend suggests supply is still dominating until proven otherwise.

**Key Levels:** Climax Low: 17.28, Open of Climax Week: 20.83, Key Resistance: 26.14

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 17.28 (continuation of markdown)
- **Invalidation:** Close above 22.12 (High of SC week)
---
### BSX (NEUTRAL/BULLISH (Extreme Bearish Bar))
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
This ticker saw an extreme event in the last week (Feb 2). Volume spiked dramatically (RelVol 3.84), spread was exceptionally wide (19.32), and the close was near the low (CLV -0.85). This is a potential Selling Climax (SC), characterized by panic selling and absorption by Smart Money, despite the poor close. The sheer magnitude of the volume suggests heavy liquidation and likely the bottom of the immediate markdown phase. The prior month had also confirmed supply dominance.

**Key Levels:** Selling Climax Low: 74.86, Immediate Resistance: 94.18, Prior Support Zone: 87.03

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Long: Entry only on confirmation (Test or break of AR high). Short: Break below 74.86.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 74.86
---
### BSY (NEUTRAL/BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly context shows SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (WATCH_FOR_TEST). Following a down bar on high volume (Jan 26, CLV -0.72), the latest week (Feb 2) shows high volume (RelVol 1.79) and a wide spread, but the close is centered (CLV 0.012). This signifies stopping volume, where high supply is met by significant demand, preventing a strong close near the low. This absorption suggests Smart Money is beginning accumulation in this low area.

**Key Levels:** Stopping Volume Low: 30.96, Immediate Resistance: 35.32, Supply/Distribution Level: 39.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 35.32 on demand. Test of 32.00 on low volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 30.96
---
### BWIN (BEARISH (Short-term Climax))
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax / Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
Both weekly and monthly sequences point to SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The latest bar (Feb 2) shows extremely high volume (RelVol 2.15) on a wide down spread, closing near the middle (-0.56 CLV). While the CLV is negative, the volume suggests a huge effort (Selling Climax). The lack of a decisive close at the absolute low (18.63) means demand absorbed a large portion of the selling. This is a potential preliminary support level, but the short-term pressure remains down until an Automatic Rally confirms accumulation.

**Key Levels:** Climax Low (PS): 18.63, Immediate Resistance: 22.92, Supply Zone: 25.85

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short: Break below 18.63. Long: Confirmed test of the low.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 18.63
---
### BX (BEARISH (Extreme Bearish Bar))
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax / Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The BEARISH_TREND is accelerating. Following multiple Supply Dominance weeks, the latest bar (Feb 2) displays extreme characteristics: huge volume (RelVol 2.92), widest spread (17.99), closing poorly (CLV -0.50). This looks like a massive liquidation event (Selling Climax). Despite the massive effort, the close was in the lower half, indicating supply pressure. However, the extreme volume strongly suggests this markdown phase may be exhausting, as Smart Money is likely heavily involved on both sides (liquidation/absorption).

**Key Levels:** Selling Climax Low: 125.27, Immediate Resistance: 143.26, Monthly Open: 141.76

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short: Break below 125.27. Long: Rally and successful Test above 143.26.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 125.27
---
### BXSL (NEUTRAL/BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
In a BEARISH_TREND, the latest week (Feb 2) registered massive volume (RelVol 2.00) on a moderate spread, but the price closed firmly off the low (CLV 0.074). This is a clear indication of Stopping Volume (PS). Smart Money absorbed the heavy selling volume, preventing a sharp drop and establishing a temporary support area.

**Key Levels:** Stopping Volume Low: 24.17, Immediate Resistance: 25.51, Prior Swing Low: 25.58

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Low volume Test of 24.17 or sustained break above 25.51.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 24.17
---
### BYD (NEUTRAL/BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort Down/Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
The ticker is in a BEARISH_TREND. The latest week (Feb 2) shows high volume (RelVol 1.92) and a wide spread, but the close is poor (CLV -0.28). Although the week marked a strong effort down, the failure to close near the low suggests some demand entered (potential Stopping Volume). However, compared to previous weeks, supply still seems dominant. This bar is ambiguously mixing supply and demand—more data is needed to confirm accumulation.

**Key Levels:** Stopping Volume Low: 81.28, Immediate Resistance: 86.77, Monthly Open: 84.59

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 81.28 (Supply Confirmation)
- **Invalidation:** Close above 86.77
---
### CADE (BEARISH (Immediate Pressure))
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax/Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly context signals a Buying Climax. The latest weekly bar (Jan 26) shows absolutely massive volume (RelVol 4.79), the widest spread in the recent sequence, and a close near the low (CLV -0.48, lower half). This extreme volume spike is either a massive shakeout (Selling Climax) or intense distribution confirming a trend change. Given the poor close and the prior bullish trend, this high volume down bar strongly suggests liquidation and confirmation of the top flagged by the monthly algo. This is a Selling Climax, and we must watch for the automatic rally.

**Key Levels:** Climax Low: 41.59, Key Resistance/SC Open: 42.90, BC High: 46.74

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 41.59 (Further Markdown)
- **Invalidation:** Close above 44.87 (Rally above prior high)
---
### CAI (NEUTRAL/BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stock is in a BEARISH_TREND. Jan 26 showed Supply Dominance (high volume, low close, CLV -0.98). The latest bar (Feb 2) is flagged as STOPPING_VOLUME. High volume (RelVol 1.73) on a moderately wide spread bar, but the close is near the middle (-0.41 CLV). The volume spike suggests significant demand entered at the low (21.18) absorbing the supply, preventing a decisive low close. This marks a potential Preliminary Support.

**Key Levels:** Stopping Volume Low: 21.18, Immediate Resistance: 23.99, Prior Supply Zone: 26.85

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Low volume Test near 21.18 or break above 23.99
- **Invalidation:** Close below 21.18
---
### CARG (BEARISH (Short-term Climax))
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax / Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The bearish pressure accelerated on Feb 2. Very high volume (RelVol 1.89) on a wide spread bar, closing poorly (CLV -0.59, lower half). This action represents intense selling pressure (liquidation/Selling Climax). While demand stepped in off the absolute low (27.57), the close indicates supply maintains control. The massive volume signals potential trend exhaustion but requires confirmation of accumulation.

**Key Levels:** Climax Low: 27.57, Immediate Resistance: 32.69, Prior Supply Zone: 34.63

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short: Break below 27.57. Long: Rally and Test confirmation.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 27.57
---
### CCI (NEUTRAL/BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
In a clear BEARISH_TREND, the latest bar (Feb 2) exhibits extreme volume (RelVol 2.52) and a very wide spread, closing in the lower half (CLV -0.24). This is a strong candidate for Stopping Volume (PS). The huge volume confirms massive supply, but the failure to close at the low of the spread suggests substantial absorption by Smart Money. This markdown phase is likely exhausting.

**Key Levels:** Stopping Volume Low: 77.01, Immediate Resistance: 87.31, Monthly Low: 77.01

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Long: Confirmed Test on low volume near 77.01 or break above 87.31.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 77.01
---
### CCOI (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Weakness (High Volume, Moderate Close)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly sequence suggests a Buying Climax. The latest weekly bar (Feb 2) has high volume (RelVol 0.95) and a wide spread, but the price closed moderately high (CLV 0.22). This volume is high for the modest positive close, suggesting supply is entering the market, preventing a strong bullish move. Given the monthly climax warning, this bar indicates underlying weakness, even though the close was positive.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Support: 22.31, Recent High: 25.55, Monthly BC High: 25.97

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 22.31 (Confirming Supply)
- **Invalidation:** Close above 25.55
---
### CDNS (NEUTRAL/BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Selling Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
The BEARISH_TREND culminated in the Feb 2 bar, which shows extreme volume (RelVol 2.50) and the widest spread in the sequence (33.59). Despite the wide down bar, the CLV is -0.23, meaning the close was significantly off the low (262.75). This is strong Stopping Volume (PS). Massive liquidation was absorbed by Smart Money, indicating the likelihood of the markdown phase ending soon.

**Key Levels:** Stopping Volume Low (PS): 262.75, Immediate Resistance: 296.34, Supply Zone: 325.19

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Rally above 296.34 (AR high)
- **Invalidation:** Close below 262.75
---
### CEG (NEUTRAL/BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Selling Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
In a deep BEARISH_TREND, the latest bar (Feb 2) shows extremely high volume (RelVol 2.13) and a wide spread, closing near the middle (-0.08 CLV). This is a definitive Stopping Volume signal (PS). The massive selling pressure was met by equally massive buying, marking a potential low (243.30) for the current markdown phase. Smart Money intervention is highly likely here.

**Key Levels:** Stopping Volume Low (PS): 243.30, Immediate Resistance: 282.98, Monthly Low: 243.30

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 282.98 (AR high)
- **Invalidation:** Close below 243.30
---
### CIVI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax / Automatic Reaction

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly chart flagged BUYING_CLIMAX early in January. The week of Jan 26 shows extremely high volume (RelVol 2.71) on a narrow spread, closing poorly (CLV -0.42). This signals heavy distribution by Smart Money during the late-stage rally, characterized by high effort (volume) but poor result (narrow spread/low close). This is a potential Sign of Weakness (SOW) immediately following the BC warning.

**Key Levels:** BC High: 29.20, Immediate Support: 26.64, SOW Low: 26.64

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 26.64
- **Invalidation:** Close above 29.20
---
### CNXC (NEUTRAL/BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
In a BEARISH_TREND, the Jan 26 bar showed high supply (CLV -0.63). The latest bar (Feb 2) is a strong counter-move: high volume (RelVol 1.53) on a wide up spread, closing extremely strong near the high (CLV 0.94). This is a definitive Stopping Volume/Automatic Rally move. Smart Money absorbed selling pressure at the low (36.31) and aggressively rallied the price. This marks a likely change of character.

**Key Levels:** Stopping Volume Low: 36.31, Immediate Resistance: 40.03, Prior Supply Zone: 43.03

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 40.03 on follow-through volume, or low volume test of 37.37.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 36.31
---
### CORT (NEUTRAL/BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Weak Rally after Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly chart flagged a confirmed Buying Climax. The recent weekly sequence showed a massive bullish bar (Jan 19, CLV 0.84) followed by a deep bearish reaction (Jan 26, CLV -0.40, wide spread, high volume). The latest bar (Feb 2) attempts a rally on decent volume (RelVol 1.25), but the close is moderate (CLV 0.31). This suggests the rally is meeting significant resistance/supply following the distribution phase flagged in January. Weakness relative to effort.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Support: 38.10, Resistance: 42.26, BC High: 47.06

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 38.10 (Confirmation of Supply)
- **Invalidation:** Close above 47.06
---
### CPNG (BEARISH (Extreme Bearish Bar))
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax / Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The ticker is in a strong BEARISH_TREND with sustained supply dominance, confirmed monthly. The latest bar (Feb 2) shows extreme volume (RelVol 2.58) and a wide spread, closing poorly (CLV -0.45, lower half). This is indicative of a Selling Climax (SC) due to the immense volume. While the price closed off the low, the overwhelming selling indicates intense liquidation. Immediate short-term pressure is down, but volatility is peaking.

**Key Levels:** Climax Low (PS): 16.74, Immediate Resistance: 20.34, Supply Zone: 20.97

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 16.74 (Further Markdown)
- **Invalidation:** Close above 20.34 (High of SC week)
---
### CSGP (BEARISH (Extreme Bearish Bar))
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax / Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The ticker is deep in a BEARISH_TREND, confirmed by multiple Supply Dominance readings. The latest bar (Feb 2) shows extreme volume (RelVol 2.16) and the widest spread in the sequence (13.91), closing poorly (CLV -0.78). This suggests massive liquidation (Selling Climax). Despite the poor close, the extreme volume marks this as the most likely end of the immediate panic selling. However, short-term pressure remains intensely bearish.

**Key Levels:** Climax Low (PS): 48.76, Immediate Resistance: 62.67, Monthly Open: 61.46

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short: Break below 48.76. Long: Confirmed Test and rally above 62.67.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 48.76
---
### CTSH (NEUTRAL/BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume / Selling Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
The BEARISH_TREND intensified on Feb 2, showing very high volume (RelVol 1.89) and the widest spread in the sequence. The CLV is -0.14, meaning the price closed well off the low (72.06). This is a powerful Stopping Volume signal (PS). Smart Money aggressively absorbed supply at the lows. The scale of the movement and volume suggests this markdown phase is likely exhausting.

**Key Levels:** Stopping Volume Low (PS): 72.06, Immediate Resistance: 83.74, Prior Support: 81.43

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Rally above 83.74 (AR high)
- **Invalidation:** Close below 72.06
---
### DOCU (BEARISH (Extreme Bearish Bar))
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance / Selling Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
The BEARISH_TREND intensified sharply on Feb 2. The bar exhibits very high volume (RelVol 2.05) and a wide spread, closing poorly (CLV -0.48, lower half). This is indicative of heavy selling and liquidation (Selling Climax). The extreme volume suggests the selling is reaching an exhaustion point, though the close still implies supply remains dominant in the short term. This establishes a critical Preliminary Support level.

**Key Levels:** Climax Low (PS): 45.00, Immediate Resistance: 53.28, Prior Supply Zone: 58.65

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short: Break below 45.00. Long: Rally and Test confirmation.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 45.00
---
### DUOL (BEARISH (Extreme Bearish Bar))
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax / Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The BEARISH_TREND is accelerating, confirmed monthly. The latest bar (Feb 2) shows extremely high volume (RelVol 2.17) and a wide spread, closing poorly (CLV -0.42, lower half). This is intense liquidation (Selling Climax). While the close is off the low (112.41), the large volume suggests panic selling. Short-term bearish pressure is high, but the volatility and volume peak imply trend exhaustion is near.

**Key Levels:** Climax Low (PS): 112.41, Immediate Resistance: 136.54, Monthly Open: 133.88

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short: Break below 112.41. Long: Rally and Test confirmation.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 112.41
---
### EGO (NEUTRAL/BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
Jan 26 showed a clear Supply Dominance/Shakeout bar (high volume, wide spread, CLV -0.87). The latest bar (Feb 2) registered very high volume (RelVol 2.23) and a wide spread, but the close was near the middle (CLV -0.04). This strongly indicates Stopping Volume (PS). Smart Money absorbed the heavy selling, establishing a likely temporary bottom at 36.40. The current reaction suggests accumulation rather than continuation of distribution.

**Key Levels:** Stopping Volume Low: 36.40, Immediate Resistance: 41.86, Prior Support Zone: 42.35

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Low volume Test near 39.00 or break above 41.86.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 36.40
---
### ENR (NEUTRAL/BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Weak Rally after Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly chart flagged Supply Dominance, suggesting a top. The latest weekly bar (Feb 2) shows high volume (RelVol 1.95) on a wide spread up bar, but the close is mediocre (CLV 0.23). This indicates significant resistance and supply entering the market during the rally. The large effort failed to yield a strong close, suggesting Smart Money is distributing into this rally, confirming the monthly bearish outlook.

**Key Levels:** Immediate Support: 21.56, Resistance: 24.54 (High of Feb 2), Supply Zone: 22.27

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Failure to hold 21.56 or break below 20.47.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 24.54
---
### EPAM (BEARISH (Extreme Bearish Bar))
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax / Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The BEARISH_TREND is intensifying. The latest bar (Feb 2) shows extremely high volume (RelVol 1.89) and a very wide spread, closing poorly (CLV -0.35, lower half). This suggests a Selling Climax (SC) where massive selling is exhausted. However, the poor close still indicates supply pressure. This sets a Preliminary Support level at the low (173.45), requiring confirmation via an Automatic Rally and subsequent test.

**Key Levels:** Climax Low (PS): 173.45, Immediate Resistance: 214.43, Monthly Open: 208.00

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short: Break below 173.45. Long: Confirmed test and rally above 214.43.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 173.45
---
### EQH (NEUTRAL/BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
In a BEARISH_TREND, the latest bar (Feb 2) shows very high volume (RelVol 1.82) and a wide spread, but the price closed in the upper half (CLV 0.35). This is Stopping Volume (PS), where high volume selling was absorbed by demand, failing to push the price decisively lower. This indicates Smart Money accumulation at the low (42.37).

**Key Levels:** Stopping Volume Low: 42.37, Immediate Resistance: 47.01, Prior Support: 45.49

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 47.01 on demand, or low volume Test of 44.00.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 42.37
---
### ETHA (NEUTRAL/BULLISH (Extreme Bearish Bar))
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
The BEARISH_TREND is characterized by persistent high volume/supply. The latest bar (Feb 2) shows extreme volume (RelVol 2.17) and the widest spread in the sequence, closing poorly (CLV -0.19, near the middle). This is a strong Selling Climax (SC) signal. The immense volume confirms panic liquidation, absorbed heavily by Smart Money (preventing a low close). This sets the Preliminary Support.

**Key Levels:** Climax Low (PS): 13.77, Immediate Resistance: 18.11, Monthly Low: 13.77

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Long: Confirmed Test on low volume or break above 18.11.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 13.77
---
### EXPE (BEARISH (Extreme Bearish Bar))
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax / Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
The BEARISH_TREND saw aggressive markdown on Feb 2. The bar has very high volume (RelVol 2.27) and the widest spread (58.58), closing poorly (CLV -0.49, lower half). This combination suggests extreme liquidation (Selling Climax). Although the close is in the lower half, the sheer volume marks a potential exhaustion point for the selling. This establishes Preliminary Support at 221.93.

**Key Levels:** Climax Low (PS): 221.93, Immediate Resistance: 280.51, Monthly Open: 269.47

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Short: Break below 221.93. Long: Rally and Test confirmation.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 221.93
---
### FER (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Ultra-High Volume Up-Close (Climax/Effort)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar shows a wide spread up, closing near the high (CLV 0.9146) on above-average volume (RelVol 0.80). This is strong demand, suggesting Professional Money is actively accumulating or marking up the price. The quarterly trend is BULLISH, reinforcing this move. The monthly sequence shows early SUPPLY_DOMINANCE, but this weekly strength needs to be confirmed by follow-through. Given the strong close, the buyers are in control, at least in the short term.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 71.40 (Weekly High), Support: 67.02 (Previous Accumulation Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and sustain above 71.40 (Weekly High) or a successful 'Test' of the weekly open/midpoint (around 68.20).
- **Invalidation:** Below 67.57 (Last weekly low).
---
### FFIV (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Monthly/Weekly Reaction)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly sequence is STOPPING_VOLUME, indicating potential underlying accumulation. However, the last weekly bar shows a wide spread but closes in the middle-low range (CLV -0.064) on average volume (RelVol 0.81). This bar follows a massive spread up bar (RelVol 1.66) which failed to maintain its high close. The last bar suggests weakness, indicating that Smart Money is not yet ready for a sustained markup, or that the stopping action requires further testing. Quarterly trend is BULLISH but requires confirmation.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 285.09 (Last Weekly High), Support: 269.08 (Last Weekly Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Clear break above 285.09 on confirming volume.
- **Invalidation:** Below 269.08 (A break below this level suggests weakness has resumed).
---
### FISV (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result Down (Possible Stopping Volume Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The market is in a BEARISH Quarterly Trend and the Monthly sequence is SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The last weekly bar is a wide spread down, closing slightly below the mid-point (CLV -0.258) on Ultra-High Volume (RelVol 1.30). While the volume is high (indicating effort), the close is not near the absolute low, suggesting some buying absorbed the selling pressure. However, given the context of a downtrend and a close below the open, the dominant force remains supply. This looks like a continuation of the downtrend with some intra-bar resistance from buyers.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 63.75 (Weekly High), Support: 57.79 (Weekly Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 57.79.
- **Invalidation:** Above 63.75.
---
### GKOS (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Down Bar on High Volume (Weakness)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly context is BUYING_CLIMAX, suggesting distribution might be starting. The last weekly bar is a wide spread down, closing well below the open and midpoint (CLV -0.66) on average volume (RelVol 0.93). This lack of immediate bullish reaction after strong selling signals (previous two bars had CLVs below -0.5) reinforces the potential for distribution. However, the volume isn't climactic, keeping the verdict neutral until the key levels break.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 121.74 (Weekly High), Support: 110.65 (Weekly Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 110.65 (Weekly Low) for short confirmation.
- **Invalidation:** Above 121.74.
---
### HPQ (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** High Volume Up-Bar (Weakness)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BEARISH and the monthly sequence is SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The weekly sequence is BUYING_CLIMAX (Watch for Test). The last weekly bar is a wide spread up bar, but it closes only slightly above the midpoint (CLV 0.19) on Ultra-High Volume (RelVol 2.10). This high volume for a relatively mediocre upward close suggests Effort No Result Up, meaning Smart Money is distributing into the strength. The current momentum is weak despite the spike in volume.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 20.55 (Weekly High), Support: 18.32 (Weekly Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 18.32, or a clear weakness bar/confirmation short below 19.44.
- **Invalidation:** Above 20.55.
---
### HUM (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** High Volume Up-Close (Strength/Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stock recently experienced a monumental crash (last month's CLV -0.919). The weekly sequence is SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (Watch for Test). The last weekly bar is a medium spread up bar, closing firmly in the upper range (CLV 0.477) on high volume (RelVol 1.53). This shows aggressive buying activity following the panic flush, suggesting accumulation or a short-term bottom test. Given the massive scale of the prior drop, this is likely a secondary reaction within a base/re-accumulation phase.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 196.75 (Weekly High), Support: 186.00 (Weekly Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Successful break above 196.75, followed by confirming volume.
- **Invalidation:** Below 186.00 (A break here resumes the downtrend).
---
### ING (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** High Volume Up-Bar (Effort No Result Up)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence is BUYING_CLIMAX (Watch for Test). The last weekly bar is a wide spread up, closing slightly below the midpoint (CLV -0.287) on Ultra-High Volume (RelVol 2.15). This is classic Effort No Result Up, suggesting professional selling (distribution) occurred into the high volume rally. While the quarterly trend is bullish, this high volume weakness signals a potential reversal or a required consolidation/test phase.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 31.18 (Weekly High), Support: 29.44 (Weekly Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 31.18 on renewed strength OR break below 29.44 for confirmation of weakness.
- **Invalidation:** Above 31.18 (If entry is short) or Below 29.44 (If entry is long).
---
### IONQ (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Ultra-High Volume Down-Bar (Potential Stopping Volume)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly context is BUYING_CLIMAX, followed by two weeks of heavy selling. The last weekly bar is a wide spread down, but it closes off the absolute low (CLV -0.068) on Ultra-High Volume (RelVol 1.38). This extreme volume, failing to produce a strong close down, suggests Stopping Volume. Smart Money may be buying up the shares during the panic selling. However, the price broke significantly lower, so confirmation is needed.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 40.73 (Weekly High), Support: 29.99 (Weekly Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A bullish follow-through bar next week, closing above 40.73.
- **Invalidation:** Below 29.99.
---
### IOT (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Ultra-High Volume Down-Bar (Potential Stopping Volume)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence is STOPPING_VOLUME (Watch for Test). The last weekly bar is a wide spread down, but it closes slightly off the low (CLV -0.099) on Ultra-High Volume (RelVol 2.52). The extreme volume suggests climactic selling, but the failure to close on the absolute low hints at absorption. Given the BEARISH Quarterly Trend, this requires confirmation as accumulation.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 27.91 (Weekly High), Support: 23.38 (Weekly Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A subsequent 'Test' with low volume, or a strong up-bar above 27.91.
- **Invalidation:** Below 23.38.
---
### IREN (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Ultra-High Volume Down-Bar (Potential Stopping Volume)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly sequence is SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (Watch for Test). The last weekly bar is a very wide spread down, closing off the low (CLV -0.44) on massive, Ultra-High Volume (RelVol 1.77). This extreme volume suggests climactic selling (Stopping Volume) but the close off the lows indicates significant demand stepped in to absorb supply. This reaction follows three consecutive weeks of high volume up/down bars, indicating a major conflict zone.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 55.72 (Weekly High), Support: 36.52 (Weekly Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Confirmation of absorption via a Test bar or a rally above 55.72.
- **Invalidation:** Below 36.52.
---
### KKR (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Ultra-High Volume Down-Bar (Selling Climax)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BEARISH, and the weekly sequence is SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The last weekly bar is an extremely wide spread down (18.70 points), but it closes significantly off the absolute low (CLV -0.37) on massive, Ultra-High Volume (RelVol 3.27). This extreme volume and failure to close near the low suggests a possible Selling Climax. Smart Money likely absorbed the final panic selling into the low. This marks a potential reversal point, although a confirmation 'Test' is required.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 116.08 (Weekly High), Support: 97.37 (Weekly Low/Climax bottom)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Successful low-volume Test of 97.37 or a break above 116.08.
- **Invalidation:** Below 97.37.
---
### LHX (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Up Bar on High Volume (Effort No Result Up)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the weekly sequence is BUYING_CLIMAX. The last weekly bar is an up bar but closes slightly above the midpoint (CLV 0.378) on high volume (RelVol 1.27). High volume on a bar failing to close strongly suggests supply is entering the market, leading to an Effort No Result Up scenario, which precedes a correction or distribution phase. Needs confirmation.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 355.99 (Weekly High), Support: 335.63 (Weekly Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 335.63 for confirmation of correction, or break above 355.99 on explosive volume.
- **Invalidation:** Below 335.63.
---
### LTM (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Ultra-High Volume Up-Bar (Effort No Result Up)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence is SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (Watch for Test). The last weekly bar is a very wide spread up, but it closes significantly off the high (CLV -0.43) on Ultra-High Volume (RelVol 1.93). This is classic Effort No Result Up, indicating massive supply entering the market as the price tries to reach new highs. This is a potential Upthrust or Distribution signal, even within a BULLISH Quarterly Trend.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 70.42 (Weekly High), Support: 62.62 (Weekly Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 62.62 for confirmation of distribution, or a low volume Test of the high followed by strength.
- **Invalidation:** Above 70.42 (If entry is short) or Below 62.62 (If entry is long).
---
### NET (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Ultra-High Volume Up-Bar (Effort No Result Up)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence is STOPPING_VOLUME (Watch for Test), but the last weekly bar is inconclusive. It has a wide spread up, closing slightly above the midpoint (CLV 0.034) on Ultra-High Volume (RelVol 2.37). This suggests massive volume was met with supply, resulting in poor upward progress (Effort No Result Up). Given the BEARISH Quarterly Trend, this is likely a distribution/supply signal or a failed test of the supply zone.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 185.22 (Weekly High), Support: 160.35 (Weekly Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 160.35 for continuation short, or clear bullish follow-through above 185.22.
- **Invalidation:** Below 160.35.
---
### NFXL (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** High Volume Down-Bar (Potential Stopping Volume)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence is STOPPING_VOLUME (Watch for Test), within a BEARISH Quarterly Trend. The last weekly bar is a wide spread down, but it closes significantly off the low (CLV -0.053) on high volume (RelVol 1.54). The failure to close near the low, despite the spread, suggests some absorption of selling, hinting at Stopping Volume/accumulation. However, the overall trend is bearish, requiring caution.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 24.97 (Weekly High), Support: 21.53 (Weekly Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Clear rally and close above 24.97, confirming accumulation.
- **Invalidation:** Below 21.53.
---
### NYT (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Ultra-High Volume Down-Bar (Potential Selling Climax)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The weekly sequence is STOPPING_VOLUME (Watch for Test), within a BEARISH Quarterly Trend. The last weekly bar is an extremely wide spread down (15.17 points), but it closes significantly off the absolute low (CLV 0.218) on massive, Ultra-High Volume (RelVol 3.29). This is a strong indication of climactic selling (Stopping Volume) followed by aggressive absorption by Smart Money. This volatility suggests a major turn, but the downtrend context demands caution.

**Key Levels:** Resistance: 74.04 (Weekly High), Support: 58.87 (Weekly Low/Climax bottom)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A bullish bar next week, closing above 73.35, confirming the accumulation.
- **Invalidation:** Below 58.87.
---
### ONB (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the Monthly sequence is SUPPLY_DOMINANCE (CONFIRMED_STRONG), indicating strong institutional selling. The last weekly bar shows High Volume (RelVol 1.19) and a wide spread, but the CLV is only 0.69, suggesting effort (high volume/spread) did not result in a close near the high. This is a classic 'Effort No Result' signal at a potential peak, confirming institutional unloading into strength.

**Key Levels:** 26.17 (Recent High), 24.28 (Previous Support/Weekly Low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below the weekly low (24.28) on high volume, confirming distribution.
- **Invalidation:** A strong close above 26.17 (Recent High).
---
### ORLY (NEUTRAL/BULLISH Watch)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Test Pending)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar saw Ultra High Volume (RelVol 2.05) on a very wide spread, closing poorly (CLV -0.229). This bar is Stopping Volume, indicating significant selling pressure met by equally significant buying, halting the downward momentum that developed in the previous week (CLV -0.55). Given the Quarterly BULLISH trend, this suggests Smart Money accumulation is likely starting, but a successful test of this buying is needed.

**Key Levels:** 91.09 (Stopping Volume Low), 99.76 (Prior Resistance/Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A low-volume Test of the 91.09-92.73 area, followed by a confirmed bullish sign.
- **Invalidation:** A strong close below 91.09.
---
### OTIS (BEARISH Watch)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance (Test Pending)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The previous two weeks showed strong bearish momentum, particularly the week of 1/26 (Ultra High Volume, wide spread, CLV -0.629), indicating major Supply Dominance. The last week attempted an up move (wide spread 6.77, High Volume RelVol 2.01) but closed only mid-range (CLV 0.35). This suggests supply is still meeting attempts to rally. The Quarterly trend is BULLISH, meaning the current weakness might be a correction, but institutional selling is clearly present.

**Key Levels:** 84.00 (Critical Support/Recent Low), 92.05 (Recent High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Confirmed break and close below 84.00 (signaling Mark Down Phase).
- **Invalidation:** A strong close above 92.05.
---
### PAGP (NEUTRAL/BEARISH Watch)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Test Pending)

**Smart Money Logic:**
PAGP has experienced strong upward movement (Quarterly BULLISH). The last week saw Ultra High Volume (RelVol 2.29) on a wide bar, but the CLV is only 0.06. This indicates high effort (volume/spread) with minimal result, suggesting institutions sold heavily into the rally (Buying Climax). This halts the momentum. Given the spike in volume and poor close, a change of character is likely.

**Key Levels:** 21.22 (Climax High/Resistance), 20.12 (Last weekly low)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 20.12 on follow-through selling.
- **Invalidation:** A strong close above 21.22.
---
### PEGA (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance/Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
The market is in a Quarterly BEARISH trend. The last weekly bar shows Ultra High Volume (RelVol 2.16) and a wide spread, closing mid-low (CLV -0.28). This signifies heavy distribution/panic selling. The price broke significantly below the previous swing low of 47.27. While the high volume suggests a potential selling climax, the CLV confirms supply dominance still holds, driving the price lower.

**Key Levels:** 37.54 (Recent Low/Climax Low), 47.27 (Broken Support/New Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A low-volume rally (Test of Supply) that fails near 43.54-44.72.
- **Invalidation:** A strong close above 47.27.
---
### PGY (BULLISH Watch)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax/Spring

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BEARISH, but the weekly sequence shows climax behavior. The last bar has Ultra High Volume (RelVol 1.68) on a wide spread, but crucially, it closed in the upper half (CLV 0.05). This extreme volume spike often marks a Selling Climax or a high-volume Spring action, where institutional buyers stepped in aggressively at the low (16.54), absorbing the selling pressure.

**Key Levels:** 16.54 (Climax Low/Support), 20.52 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 20.52 on strength, or a successful low-volume test of the 17-18 area.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 16.54.
---
### PLTU (BULLISH Watch)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
PLTU is in a Quarterly BEARISH trend but exhibited extreme volatility and volume. The last bar saw immense volume (RelVol 3.22) on a very wide spread, closing mid-low (CLV -0.64). The extreme volume spike suggests a panic Selling Climax, potentially washing out weak hands near the low (36.25). The last two monthly bars confirm aggressive selling (CLVs of -0.937 and -0.646). We need to monitor for a strong absorption of supply.

**Key Levels:** 36.25 (Climax Low/Support), 51.61 (Immediate Resistance/Open)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Confirmed bullish reversal signal (Test, No Supply) following the climax, breaking the 51.61 level.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 36.25.
---
### PPL (NEUTRAL/BULLISH Watch)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Test Pending)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar shows Ultra High Volume (RelVol 2.14) on a moderate spread, closing slightly above the middle (CLV 0.123). This volume spike occurred after a minor downtrend, suggesting potential institutional buying absorbed supply (Stopping Volume). The close off the low (35.09) shows demand is active, despite the overall down-bar action.

**Key Levels:** 35.09 (Stopping Volume Low), 36.88 (Recent High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A low-volume Test of the 35.50 area, followed by upward continuation.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 35.09.
---
### PRU (BEARISH Watch)
**VSA Status:** Supply Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
The last weekly bar saw Ultra High Volume (RelVol 2.74) on a very wide spread, marking a significant drop from 1/26's strong rally (CLV 0.98). The last bar closed heavily in the lower half (CLV -0.415), suggesting the massive volume was largely supply overpowering demand, particularly given the Quarterly BEARISH context. This confirms a dramatic change of character/distribution failure at the high, leading to a major markdown.

**Key Levels:** 98.80 (Climax Low/Support), 111.11 (Prior Support/New Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A test of supply (low volume rally) failing below 105, or a confirmed break of 98.80.
- **Invalidation:** A strong close above 111.11.
---
### PTC (NEUTRAL/BULLISH Watch)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Test Pending)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH. The last weekly bar shows Ultra High Volume (RelVol 2.50) on a wide spread, but closed mid-range (CLV 0.41). This spike in volume, following selling pressure (CLV -0.378 the week prior), suggests institutional buying (Stopping Volume) stepped in near the low (146.72), absorbing supply and halting the decline. The subsequent mid-range close indicates a balance between buying and selling.

**Key Levels:** 146.72 (Stopping Volume Low), 159.46 (Recent High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A low-volume Test of the 150-152 area, or a break above 159.46.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 146.72.
---
### PTGX (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Potential Absorption (Weakness)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly sequence shows BUYING_CLIMAX (CONFIRMED_EARLY), suggesting structural weakness. However, the last weekly bar showed High Volume (RelVol 1.04) and a strong close (CLV 0.455), indicating demand stepped in and closed the bar off the lows. Given the bearish quarterly trend and the monthly climax, this bar looks like a reversal attempt, likely absorbing previous supply. We need more confirmation of demand strength.

**Key Levels:** 80.20 (Recent Low/Support), 86.09 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A definitive close above 86.09 on strong volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 80.20.
---
### PYPL (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax/Panic Selling

**Smart Money Logic:**
PYPL is in a severe BEARISH trend. The last bar printed Ultra High Volume (RelVol 3.71) on an extreme spread, closing near the low (CLV -0.78). This is a textbook example of panic selling or a Selling Climax. However, because the CLV is so poor, the supply side won the battle, meaning the climax is not yet confirmed as a genuine turning point. This massive volume represents both supply (panic sellers) and early institutional demand, but supply dominated the weekly close.

**Key Levels:** 38.88 (Climax Low/Support), 52.06 (Prior Support/Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A subsequent Test bar with significantly reduced volume and price hold above 38.88.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 38.88.
---
### QQQI (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Test Pending)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The market is BULLISH Quarterly but shows a Monthly Buying Climax. The last weekly bar saw Ultra High Volume (RelVol 1.96) on a wide spread, but the close was mid-range (CLV -0.03), indicating Stopping Volume. Institutions stepped in at the low (51.83) to absorb the supply generated by the previous week's selling (CLV -0.51). The lack of bullish follow-through suggests the market is currently balanced or undergoing a larger distribution/accumulation effort.

**Key Levels:** 51.83 (Stopping Volume Low), 54.67 (Recent High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Low-volume test of the 52.00 area, confirming accumulation.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 51.83.
---
### RARE (NEUTRAL/BEARISH Watch)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result

**Smart Money Logic:**
Despite a BULLISH Quarterly trend, the Monthly is in SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The last weekly bar had High Volume (RelVol 1.43) and a strong close off the low (CLV 0.0088), suggesting buying stepped in, but the spread was wide and the closing location (mid-range) shows weakness relative to the bar's effort. It failed to significantly exceed the recent highs (25.0) on high volume. This looks like absorbed supply met the rally, leading to Effort No Result.

**Key Levels:** 25.81 (Recent High/Resistance), 23.55 (Last weekly low/Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 25.81 on high volume (showing renewed demand) OR break below 23.55 (confirming supply).
- **Invalidation:** Close above 25.81 or below 23.55.
---
### RGLD (NEUTRAL/BULLISH Watch)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax (Reversal Attempt)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart shows CONFIRMED_EARLY SUPPLY_DOMINANCE, suggesting trouble despite the BULLISH Quarterly trend. The previous week saw a Selling Climax (RelVol 1.12, wide spread, CLV -0.801). The last weekly bar had High Volume (RelVol 1.28) and a wide spread, attempting a reversal but only closing mid-range (CLV 0.119). This indicates absorption of supply is occurring, but the immediate up-move lacks convincing strength to overcome the climax selling.

**Key Levels:** 253.19 (Climax Low/Support), 293.98 (Climax High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Low-volume test of the 260 area, followed by upward continuation.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 253.19.
---
### RTO (NEUTRAL/BEARISH Watch)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result/Immediate Supply

**Smart Money Logic:**
RTO has a BULLISH Quarterly trend but is showing signs of a Buying Climax (detected). The last bar has Ultra High Volume (RelVol 3.39) on a moderate spread, closing mid-range (CLV 0.203). The huge volume spike compared to the muted price movement strongly indicates institutional selling (distribution) into strength, halting the rally. This Effort No Result is a major warning sign.

**Key Levels:** 32.68 (Recent High/Resistance), 31.36 (Last weekly low/Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Confirmed weakness (Supply Confirmation) below 31.36.
- **Invalidation:** A strong close above 32.68.
---
### RVMD (NEUTRAL)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Re-accumulation/Test)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart confirmed an early BUYING_CLIMAX in the previous month. The last weekly bar saw lower volume (RelVol 0.93) and a mid-range close (CLV 0.36), suggesting that the immense supply that previously hit the market (weeks 1/5 and 1/26) has lessened, and demand is absorbing the remains. This looks like a low volume rally/test after a major shakeout, holding above key support.

**Key Levels:** 93.01 (Support), 99.58 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break above 99.58 on increased volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 93.01.
---
### RYAAY (NEUTRAL/BEARISH Watch)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Test Pending)

**Smart Money Logic:**
RYAAY is in a BEARISH Quarterly trend. The last bar had High Volume (RelVol 1.33) and a wide spread, but closed mid-low (CLV -0.48). This is 'Stopping Volume', suggesting institutional buying stepped in at the low (67.23) to halt the decline, yet the close was still poor. This creates a supply/demand standoff at the low, needing a proper test.

**Key Levels:** 67.23 (Stopping Volume Low), 72.55 (Recent High/Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A low-volume test of 68.00 area or a break above 72.55.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 67.23.
---
### SARO (NEUTRAL/BULLISH Watch)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Test Pending)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The week of 1/26 saw extreme volume (RelVol 4.29) and a wide spread, closing near the low (CLV -0.91), signaling a clear Selling Climax. The last bar showed high volume (RelVol 2.07) but a relatively narrow spread, closing mid-range (CLV 0.51). This indicates demand is actively soaking up remaining supply from the climax, creating an accumulation phase. The close well off the low (28.62) is positive.

**Key Levels:** 28.62 (Climax Low/Support), 31.19 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A low-volume test of the 29.50 area, followed by a confirmed break above 31.19.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 28.62.
---
### SATS (BEARISH Watch)
**VSA Status:** Effort No Result/Distribution

**Smart Money Logic:**
Quarterly trend is BULLISH, but the Monthly is WATCH_FOR_TEST (Buying Climax). The last weekly bar saw High Volume (RelVol 1.31) on a wide spread, closing mid-low (CLV -0.38). This confirms supply dominance immediately following the severe distribution/shakeout bar from 1/26 (CLV -0.67 on Ultra High Volume). The failure of the price to rally on the last bar suggests smart money is actively distributing into strength.

**Key Levels:** 106.59 (Support/Shakeout Low), 122.98 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 106.59 on heavy volume.
- **Invalidation:** A strong close above 122.98.
---
### SONY (NEUTRAL/BULLISH Watch)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax (Test Pending)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH, but the last weekly bar showed Ultra High Volume (RelVol 2.71) on a wide spread, closing mid-range (CLV 0.301). Following weeks of Supply Dominance, this massive volume spike with a close off the low (21.18) strongly suggests a Selling Climax, where institutional demand absorbed panic selling.

**Key Levels:** 21.18 (Climax Low/Support), 23.12 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Low-volume test (No Supply) of the 21.50 area, or a break above 23.12.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 21.18.
---
### SPOT (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Climax/Strong Markdown

**Smart Money Logic:**
SPOT is in a BEARISH trend. The last bar saw Ultra High Volume (RelVol 2.98) on an extremely wide spread, closing heavily in the lower half (CLV -0.67). This is massive selling, continuing the markdown from the previous month. While the volume is climactic, the poor CLV indicates supply is still dominating, confirming the bearish environment and a major institutional dumping event.

**Key Levels:** 405.00 (Climax Low/Support), 493.30 (Prior Support/Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Failure on a rally back toward 450, or break below 405.00.
- **Invalidation:** Strong close above 493.30.
---
### SSNC (NEUTRAL/BULLISH Watch)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax (Reversal Attempt)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Quarterly trend is BEARISH. The last weekly bar saw Ultra High Volume (RelVol 3.44) on a very wide spread, closing slightly above the middle (CLV 0.09). This volume spike, following a supply bar (CLV -0.82), strongly indicates institutional buying (Stopping Volume/Climax) stepped in at the low (70.88), absorbing supply and reversing the close away from the low. This is a potential accumulation signal.

**Key Levels:** 70.88 (Stopping Volume Low/Support), 82.80 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A low-volume test of the 73-75 area, followed by a confirmed break above 82.80.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 70.88.
---
### STAA (NEUTRAL/BULLISH Watch)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Test Pending)

**Smart Money Logic:**
STAA is in a BEARISH trend and confirmed early Stopping Volume. The last bar saw High Volume (RelVol 1.49) on a moderate spread, closing mid-low (CLV -0.37). The action suggests demand stepped in aggressively at the low (16.94) to halt the decline, but was unable to push the close much higher, indicating lingering supply needs to be cleared. This confirms the Stopping Volume signal and sets up for a Test.

**Key Levels:** 16.94 (Stopping Volume Low/Support), 19.65 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A low-volume test of the 17.50 area (No Supply), followed by a break above 19.00.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 16.94.
---
### TROW (BEARISH Watch)
**VSA Status:** Supply Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
TROW is in a BEARISH trend. The last weekly bar saw Ultra High Volume (RelVol 2.46) on a very wide spread, closing poorly near the low (CLV -0.62). This marks a Selling Climax, indicating panic selling. However, the close position confirms that supply completely dominated demand, driving the price down sharply. This is a continuation of the markdown phase unless demand quickly follows up.

**Key Levels:** 91.69 (Climax Low/Support), 103.63 (Prior Support/Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A subsequent low-volume Test of the 95-97 area, followed by a confirmed bullish reversal.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 91.69.
---
### TRU (BULLISH Watch)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Reversal Confirmation)

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly trend is CONFIRMED_STRONG Stopping Volume. The last weekly bar saw Ultra High Volume (RelVol 1.92) on a very wide spread, closing mid-range (CLV 0.124). This is likely a powerful Stopping Volume action, where strong institutional buyers stepped in at the low (65.23) to absorb heavy selling (Climax/Spring). The mid-range close suggests a balance point where supply was met and halted.

**Key Levels:** 65.23 (Spring Low/Support), 79.90 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A low-volume test of the 70-72 area, or a break above 79.90.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 65.23.
---
### UBER (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance/Climax

**Smart Money Logic:**
UBER is in a BEARISH trend. The last bar printed Ultra High Volume (RelVol 2.10) on a wide spread, closing mid-low (CLV -0.42). This suggests Supply Dominance is still active. Although the volume is high (potential climax), the close indicates that sellers still controlled the week's range, confirming the ongoing markdown phase.

**Key Levels:** 71.87 (Climax Low/Support), 81.88 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Failure on a low-volume rally back toward 78, or confirmed break below 71.87.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 81.88.
---
### UNH (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax/Strong Markdown

**Smart Money Logic:**
UNH is in a BEARISH trend. The last week saw High Volume (RelVol 1.52) and a very wide spread, closing mid-low (CLV -0.14). This follows an extreme distribution event the previous week (Ultra High Volume, CLV -0.82). The action confirms strong supply is still present, driving the price lower. While the high volume suggests a climax near the low (266.29), the close is not convincing enough for an immediate reversal.

**Key Levels:** 266.29 (Climax Low/Support), 290.39 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Failure on a low-volume rally toward 285-290, or a break below 266.29.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 290.39.
---
### UNM (NEUTRAL/BULLISH Watch)
**VSA Status:** Stopping Volume (Test Pending)

**Smart Money Logic:**
UNM is in a BEARISH trend, but the last bar shows Ultra High Volume (RelVol 2.25) on a wide spread, closing mid-range (CLV 0.089). This is Stopping Volume, indicating significant institutional buying absorbed supply near the low (69.93). The strong volume and close off the lows suggest that the recent selling pressure has been halted, preparing for a potential phase B accumulation.

**Key Levels:** 69.93 (Stopping Volume Low/Support), 78.41 (Recent High)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A low-volume Test (No Supply) of the 72-73 area, followed by a confirmed break above 78.41.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 69.93.
---
### VLTO (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Climax/Strong Markdown

**Smart Money Logic:**
VLTO is in a BEARISH trend. The last bar saw Ultra High Volume (RelVol 2.55) on a very wide spread, closing poorly (CLV -0.66). This is a classic Supply Climax. While climactic volume suggests a turning point might be near, the poor close confirms that supply completely overwhelmed demand, initiating a severe markdown phase.

**Key Levels:** 88.40 (Climax Low/Support), 100.55 (Prior Support/Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Failure on a low-volume rally toward 94, or a confirmed break below 88.40.
- **Invalidation:** A strong close above 100.55.
---
### VONG (NEUTRAL/BEARISH Watch)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance/Stopping Volume

**Smart Money Logic:**
The Monthly chart shows CONFIRMED_EARLY Stopping Volume, suggesting accumulation attempts. However, the last weekly bar showed High Volume (RelVol 1.72) and a wide spread, closing near the middle/low (CLV -0.046). This indicates persistent supply entering the market, negating the bullish momentum hinted at by the stopping volume. The failure to rally on high effort suggests distribution is present within the current sideways/downward chop.

**Key Levels:** 114.48 (Recent Low/Support), 120.77 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Confirmed weakness (Supply Confirmation) below 114.48.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 120.77.
---
### WGMI (NEUTRAL/BULLISH Watch)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax (Test Pending)

**Smart Money Logic:**
WGMI is in a BULLISH Quarterly trend but showed climax signals. The last bar printed Ultra High Volume (RelVol 1.88) on a very wide spread, closing mid-low (CLV -0.064). This extreme volume spike, following severe selling the previous week (CLV -0.82), indicates institutional buying (Stopping Volume/Climax) stepped in at the low (34.99) to halt the decline. The lack of a high close means supply was absorbed but needs confirmation.

**Key Levels:** 34.99 (Climax Low/Support), 46.61 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A low-volume test of the 37-39 area, followed by upward continuation.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 34.99.
---
### WMG (NEUTRAL/BULLISH Watch)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax (Test Pending)

**Smart Money Logic:**
WMG is in a BEARISH trend. The last weekly bar saw Ultra High Volume (RelVol 2.91) on a wide spread, closing mid-range (CLV 0.321). This volume spike, following a decline, suggests a Selling Climax or stopping volume occurred near the low (26.42). Institutional demand likely entered the market here, absorbing supply and managing to push the close off the extreme low. This demands a low-volume test.

**Key Levels:** 26.42 (Stopping Volume Low/Support), 30.39 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A low-volume test of the 27.50 area, followed by a confirmed bullish reversal.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 26.42.
---
### WPM (NEUTRAL/BULLISH Watch)
**VSA Status:** Supply Absorption/Test

**Smart Money Logic:**
WPM is BULLISH Quarterly. Following a Buying Climax/Distribution bar on 1/26 (Ultra High Volume, CLV -0.89), the last bar saw high volume (RelVol 1.62) and a wide spread, but managed to close mid-range (CLV 0.126). This action suggests institutional demand absorbed the massive selling from the prior week, preventing a collapse. The volume confirms continued institutional activity, likely accumulation taking place after a shakeout.

**Key Levels:** 129.11 (Shakeout Low/Support), 141.30 (Immediate Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** A definitive close above 141.30 on strong volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 129.11.
---
### WRB (BULLISH)
**VSA Status:** Reaccumulation/Absorption

**Smart Money Logic:**
The monthly context shows SUPPLY_DOMINANCE is confirmed early after a high volume down bar in December 2025. However, the subsequent weeks show decreasing spread and slightly decreasing relative volume (below 1.0) while price holds above the low of the major supply bar's close. The most recent weekly bar (2026-02-02) shows a wide spread UP close near the high (CLV 0.358), on lower relative volume (0.80). This suggests that the remaining supply is being absorbed, and the effort (spread) is being matched by results (close higher), despite the lower volume. This looks like a quiet absorption phase after testing the lower boundary of the recent chop/consolidation. The rally off the 65.02 low suggests demand stepping in.

**Key Levels:** 71.90 (Recent High/Potential Resistance), 68.50 (Recent Consolidation Midpoint), 67.25 (Test Low/Support)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Weekly close above $71.91 (or a successful Test on low volume near $68.50).
- **Invalidation:** Weekly close below $67.00
---
### Z (NEUTRAL/BEARISH PENDING TEST)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax / Extreme Weakness

**Smart Money Logic:**
The stock is in a clear BEARISH_TREND. The last two weekly bars show extreme weakness. The bar for 2026-01-26 was a wide spread down bar, closing near the low (CLV -0.905), indicating strong supply. This was followed by the 2026-02-02 bar, an extreme wide spread down bar with massive relative volume (2.57), suggesting a potential Selling Climax (SC). The close is near the low (CLV -0.744), confirming overwhelming supply/panic selling. Although a SC typically precedes a rally, the sheer volume and downward momentum are highly aggressive. We must wait for the reaction rally and the subsequent low-volume Test of the SC low before considering accumulation. Currently, the pressure remains overwhelmingly to the downside.

**Key Levels:** 62.66 (Resistance/Previous Support), 53.61 (Selling Climax Low/Key Support), 64.25 (Recent high, potential relief rally target)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Failed Test of $53.61 low on ultra-low volume, or a successful low-volume rally back toward $60.
- **Invalidation:** Sustained break and close below $53.00 (signaling continuation of the markdown)
---
### ZM (NEUTRAL/BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (BC) / Effort No Result Down

**Smart Money Logic:**
The quarterly context is BULLISH_TREND, but recent action suggests a reversal. The week of 2026-01-26 saw extreme high volume (RelVol 2.00) on a wide spread up bar, but the Close was only near the middle (CLV 0.019), flagging a potential Buying Climax (BC) and heavy distribution. The following week (2026-02-02) saw similarly high volume (RelVol 1.92) on a slightly tighter spread, but the price could not make significant headway higher (close only slightly higher, CLV 0.411). The huge volume surge suggests Smart Money is offloading. This high-volume churn near the highs, unable to sustain the breakout, classifies as a Buying Climax/Distribution area. The rally above 90 is proving difficult to sustain.

**Key Levels:** 97.58 (BC High / Resistance), 91.70 (Open of last week / Immediate Support), 87.19 (Recent Low / Last line of support before markdown)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below $87.19 confirmed by high volume (SOW). Alternatively, a successful Test of $97.58 on low volume (if price manages to rally first).
- **Invalidation:** Weekly close substantially above $97.58 (signaling continuation of markup)
---
## Other
### PLTR (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Selling Climax/Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
PLTR is in a strong BEARISH trend. The last week saw colossal volume (RelVol 2.19) on a massive spread (36.75), closing deeply in the lower half (CLV -0.58). While the volume spike suggests a potential Selling Climax, the poor CLV indicates that supply is still overwhelming demand, pushing the close far from the high. This is a continuation of supply dominance, confirming the markdown phase.

**Key Levels:** 128.32 (Climax Low), 145.13 (Prior Support/New Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below 128.32, or failure on a low-volume rally toward 140.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 145.13.
---
### RKT (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance

**Smart Money Logic:**
RKT is in a Quarterly BEARISH trend and Monthly SUPPLY_DOMINANCE. The last bar had High Volume (RelVol 1.24) and a wide spread, but closed mid-low (CLV -0.309). This indicates selling pressure continues to dominate, failing to achieve a strong close despite the buying interest at the low. It is confirming the markdown phase following the prior week's significant decline (CLV -0.59).

**Key Levels:** 17.65 (Recent Low/Support), 21.37 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break below 17.65 on heavy volume.
- **Invalidation:** Close above 21.37.
---
### RYN (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Supply Dominance/Effort No Result

**Smart Money Logic:**
RYN is in a BULLISH Quarterly trend, but the Monthly shows a BUYING_CLIMAX (WATCH_FOR_TEST). The last week saw Ultra High Volume (RelVol 2.32) on a narrow spread, closing near the low (CLV -0.60). This is aggressive selling (Supply Dominance) that is confirmed by the high volume, breaking the previous week's low (22.32). This confirms institutional selling pressure is overwhelming demand.

**Key Levels:** 22.32 (Recent Low/Support), 24.01 (Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Confirmed break below 22.32.
- **Invalidation:** A strong close above 24.01.
---
### UGI (BEARISH)
**VSA Status:** Buying Climax (Change of Character)

**Smart Money Logic:**
UGI is in a BULLISH trend but experienced significant institutional selling. The previous week was a Buying Climax (CLV -0.02, Ultra High Volume). The last weekly bar had High Volume (RelVol 1.40) on a wide spread, closing at the absolute low (CLV -1.0). This is a definitive sign of weakness (Supply Dominance/Change of Character), confirming that distribution from the previous bar has initiated a severe markdown.

**Key Levels:** 37.09 (New Support/Low), 40.97 (Climax High/Resistance)

#### Action Plan
- **Entry Trigger:** Break and close below 37.09.
- **Invalidation:** A strong close above 40.97.
